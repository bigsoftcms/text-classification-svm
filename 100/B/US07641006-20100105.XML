<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The hybrid-electric drives offer potential benefits over conventional mechanical drives in terms of reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and the utilization of smaller engines. For a military vehicle, e.g., tank, this can provide a significant advantage since with lower fuel requirements, the military vehicle will be able to travel further to either reach a target or be able to flee to safety. Also, the current weight of some military vehicles is a problem. Currently, tanks like the Abrams, M1 and others are about sixty (60) tons in weight. There are tremendous advantages with regard to mobility in combat if the military vehicle can be one-half or one-third of the weight of a current military vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A major problem with current military vehicles, e.g., tanks, which utilize tracks or drive belts, is that during combat, these tracks or drive belts can be dislodged. This renders the military vehicle a sitting target due to the fact that the tank is now completely immobilized. The operators of the tank then have to flee and in the process expose themselves to enemy fire and possible capture. This &#x201c;mobility kill&#x201d; is a significant problem for our armed forces that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, present day track systems utilized in tanks have problems regarding how to drive such tracks with the entrained wheels, how to maintain structural integrity of the track and wheels, how to encompass the track in lateral alignment with the wheels when the wheels are subjected to large obstacles in the road, how to provide long life for the track and wheels, how to accommodate debris ingested between the track and belt while maintaining the driving relationship therebetween without damaging either, how to preclude the track from coming off the wheels, how to brake the track and wheel systems, how to preclude the track from coming off of the wheels during braking, and how to maintain proper belt tension during braking and turning.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current positive drive belt systems usually have only one wheel positively engaged with the belt causing premature wear when braking occurs. Furthermore, known positive drive belt systems provide insufficient recoil to allow foreign material to escape from the belt system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, track driven systems are &#x201c;hard&#x201d; riding. Specifically, track driven systems lack suspension systems entirely or have primitive suspension systems resulting in a rough ride.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to overcome one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although a two wheel station embodiment is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> indicated by numeral <b>10</b> with middle rollers <b>40</b>, a five wheel station or six wheel station embodiment is preferred for a typical military vehicle application, e.g., tank, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and generally indicated by numeral <b>400</b>. The electric drive running gear system for a tank is generally indicated by numeral <b>401</b>. However, the number of electric motor drives and electric drive motors will need to be increased accordingly. The first wheel station is indicated by first lug engaged rear wheel <b>15</b>, a second wheel station is indicated a second lug engaged wheel <b>402</b>, a third wheel station is indicated a third lug engaged wheel <b>404</b>, a fourth wheel station is indicated a fourth lug engaged wheel <b>406</b>, a fifth wheel station is indicated a fourth lug engaged wheel <b>408</b>, and a sixth wheel station is indicated by a sixth lug engaged front wheel <b>14</b>. Positioned on top of the electric drive running gear system <b>401</b> is a turret <b>410</b> that is preferably rotatable. Mounted on the turret <b>410</b> is a gun <b>412</b>. Any of a wide variety of available guns will suffice. For example, modern tank guns can include, but are not limited to, a large caliber high-velocity gun, a machine gun, a high explosive anti-tank gun, an automatic cannon and a guided missile.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> are shown. The lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> preferably include a series of paddles <b>17</b>. The series of paddles assist in mud and sand and allow the vehicle to keep moving. Also, the paddles <b>17</b> protrude out of the lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> for a &#x201c;mobility kill&#x201d; if the belts <b>13</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, become lost. The lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> each having a circumference <b>9</b> with retractable paddles <b>17</b> that are compressed when a belt <b>13</b> is positioned around the circumference <b>9</b> of the lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> and extended therefrom when the belt <b>13</b> is removed for engagement into the earth for movement therein. The lug engaged front wheels <b>14</b> and the lug engaged rear wheels <b>15</b> also have front windows or openings <b>16</b> in the circumference. In an alternative embodiment, side windows (not shown) are provided in the side of the lug engaged front and rear wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.

In addition, the front windows <b>16</b> are used to receive lugs <b>18</b> on belts <b>13</b>, which are best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The lugs <b>18</b> enter the front windows <b>16</b> in much the same way that meshing gears interact with one another. As the lug engaged wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> rotate, the lugs <b>18</b> mate with the front windows <b>16</b>, and the belts <b>13</b> are positively driven by the lug engaged wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternative embodiment, there are no windows <b>16</b> in the lug engaged wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. Rather, the lug engaged wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and the lugs <b>18</b> mate in much the same way as two gears mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a suspension system <b>12</b> is operatively mounted to each side of the lower sections <b>11</b> of the track driven device <b>10</b>, e.g., military vehicle. The suspension systems <b>12</b> provide independent suspension for the belts <b>13</b>. The suspension systems <b>12</b> absorb load stresses and allow the lug engaged wheels <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> to move vertically when an object is encountered providing a more comfortable, controlled and safe ride while prolonging the life of the track driven device <b>10</b>, e.g., military vehicle such as a tank.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although it is understood that the track driven device <b>10</b>, e.g., military vehicle, has two belts <b>13</b> and two suspension systems <b>12</b>, the description that follows describes one side of the track driven device <b>10</b>, e.g. military vehicle. Referring in combination to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the suspension system <b>12</b> has a front, lower suspension bracket <b>19</b> and rear, lower suspension bracket <b>119</b>.</p>
