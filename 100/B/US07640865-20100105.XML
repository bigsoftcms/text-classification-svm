<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE OF RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority, under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119, of German applications DE 10 2006 025 188.1, filed May 29, 2006, and DE 20 2006 010 790, filed Jul. 13, 2006; the prior applications are herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a rail car shunting device for road-rail operation, also referred to as a rail car mover, or a road-rail vehicle. The rail car shunting device for road-rail operation allows for switching rail cars that are guided on tracks with two parallel rails. The rail car mover has a bogie and wheels which are mounted thereon and which are provided with rubber tires.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rail car shunting devices are used on private or public rail networks for shunting operations of rail cars and have, in addition to the rubber tires for conventional road mode, a bogie with four rail wheels which are adapted to the gauge of the respective rail network and which enable the vehicles to be able to move along the rails of the rail network after the deployment of the rail wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this context, the changeover to rail mode is done by deploying the bogie with the rail wheels by means of activation devices in the form of hydraulic cylinders or pneumatic cylinders, and as a result the vehicle can be lifted over the rails so that the driven wheels for the road mode are subsequently in the air.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The vehicle is driven in the rail mode here using, for example, hydraulic motors which drive the rail wheels in order to make available the drive torques which are necessary to shunt the rail cars which weigh, for example, 800 t, on the rails with all four rail wheels being preferably driven in order to obtain the highest possible traction force or traction power.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this context, with the known rail car shunting devices there is the problem that, in addition to the wheel set of four rail wheels, they additionally must have a further wheel set of at least 3 road wheels which have rubber tires and which not only have to be retracted and deployed in a costly fashion by means of suitable pneumatic or hydraulic adjusting devices but also have to be of a steerable design in order to maneuver the rail car shunting device on a level road surface and to move it onto the rails. As a result of the associated high degree of expenditure on devices the known rail car shunting devices are comparatively expensive and consequently also liable to faults owing to the complicated mechanics/hydraulics.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a rail car mover with rail and road propulsion which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and which provides for a rail car shunting device which is structurally simple and which can be used both in road and rail mode without restrictions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a rail car shunting device, or a rail car mover for road-rail operation, for shunting rail cars guided on a track with mutually parallel rails. The novel device comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a bogie having four wheels with rubber tires;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">bolt elements each assigned to a respective the wheel and mounted for movement from a first, retracted position for a road mode in which a lower end face of the bolt element is disposed above the rolling level of the wheel, downward beyond the rolling level into a second, deployed position for a rail mode in which the lower end face of the bolt element is disposed below the rolling level;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">an adjusting device for moving each the bolt element between the retracted position for the road mode and the deployed position for the rail mode, such that, in the deployed position, outer peripheral faces of the bolt elements of two wheels that are assigned to one another extend along an inner lateral edge and/or an outer lateral edge of the rails in order to guide the wheels on the rails.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the above and other objects in view there is also provided in accordance with an alternative aspect of the invention, a similar rail car mover wherein disk elements are each assigned to a respective wheel and mounted for movement from a first, retracted position for a road mode in which the disk element is disposed above the rolling level of the wheel, downward beyond the rolling level into a second, deployed position for a rail mode. The adjusting device moves each the disk element between the retracted position for the road mode and the deployed position for the rail mode, such that, in the deployed position, lateral end faces of the disk element of two wheels that are assigned to one another extend along an inner lateral edge and/or an outer lateral edge of the rails in order to guide the wheels on the rails.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, according to the invention, a rail car shunting device for road-rail operation, with which in particular rail cars can be switched individually in a known fashion on two rails or tracks which extend parallel to one another or else in groups comprises a bogie on which preferably four wheels which have rubber tires are mounted. Each of the wheels, which are arranged in pairs along an axle at a distance corresponding to the distance between the rails and which accordingly run on the rails, is assigned a bolt element for guiding the wheels or the rail car shunting device on the rails. The bolt elements which are assigned to each wheel can, according to the invention, be moved using an adjusting device, which also includes a manual adjusting device, from a first retracted position for the road mode, in which the ground-side end face of the bolt element is located above the rolling level of the wheel, beyond the rolling level into a second deployed position for the rail mode in which the ground-side end face of each bolt element is located underneath the rolling level and the preferably cylindrical case shaped external circumferential faces of the bolt elements which, in relation to one axle, respectively extend in a pair in the region of the inner edges of the tracks or rails. In this context, there is preferably a distance of, for example 1 mm up to 10 mm or even more between the edge of each rail and the circumferential face of the bolt element so that during the rail mode just one of the two bolt elements of a pair of wheels is ever in contact with the edge, which advantageously reduces the friction if bolt elements which are mounted in a rotationally fixed fashion on the bogie are used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the bolt elements are however preferably rotatably mounted in bearings, as a result of which the bolt elements can rotate during the rail mode when there is contact with the edges of the tracks, which again advantageously reduces the frictional forces.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further idea on which the invention is based, each bolt element has a spring elastic force applied to it in the direction of the ground by spring elastic means, in particular a helical compression spring, as a result of which the bolt element is moved into the first position counter to the spring elastic force as it moves over from level surfaces in the track region, such as are also used to move the rail car shunting device according to the invention onto and off the rails, when the end face of the bolt element makes contact with the upper side of the run up face or else an object, such as a stone or the like, which has become inadvertently jammed in the gap between the edge of the rail and the run up face.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the adjusting device comprises a servomotor which acts on the bolt element and which can be used to move the bolt element out of the first position into the second position by motor. In this context, the servomotors of all four bolt elements can preferably be activated from the control console or the drawbar of the rail car shunting device by means of an electronic control device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further idea on which the invention is based, the adjusting device of each bolt element comprises a linear guide which is preferably mounted on the bogie and a support which is displaceably guided in the guide and which can, for example, have a rectangular cross section and on which the bolt element is preferably rotatably mounted by means of ball bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this embodiment of the invention there is furthermore provision for the spring elastic means to comprise a helical spring which acts between the support and the guide and which applies the spring elastic force to the support in the direction of the second deployed position, for which purpose the movement of the support into the second deployed position is limited by a stop and the helical spring is held under prestress between the support and guide.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bolt element is preferably mounted on the support in ball bearings here.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further idea on which the invention is based, at least two, but preferably all four, wheels are mounted on the bogie so as to be pivotable about a vertical axis in order to be able to steer the rail car shunting device in a desired direction when the bolt elements are retracted in the road mode and, if desired, also to be able to rotate them on the spot.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For this purpose, preferably all four wheels can be pivoted individually by means of servomotors, with the servomotors being actuable from the driver's cab via a central control device. However, in the same way there is also the possibility of driving at least two of the wheels, as in the case of a passenger car, by means of a known steering gear.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to transmit the largest possible torque from the wheels to the rails, in the preferred embodiment of the invention preferably all four wheels are driven, with in particular each wheel being assigned a separate drive motor which drives the wheel in particular by means of a gear mechanism. This results, in combination with the previously described individual pivotability of the wheels, in a rail car shunting device which can turn in a very small space, in particular in the road mode, as a result of which even small run-up ramps are sufficient in order to move the vehicle onto the rails. In addition, the drive via four individual motors opens up the possibility of regulating the drive torques of the engines by means of a suitable control device in such a way that a slip or even unbraked spinning of the wheels in the shunting mode with a high load can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this context, it proves particularly advantageous if the drive motors are electric motors since, owing to their compact design and the comparatively high startup torques compared to internal combustion engines, they can be connected by flanges directly to their respective drive wheel via a suitable gear mechanism, for example a bevel gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to obtain a high degree of flexibility of the rail car shunting device according to the invention, the electric motors are preferably fed from a known accumulator battery, and it is also conceivable to additionally provide a current generator on the bogie in order to charge up or intermediately charge the accumulator battery during relatively lengthy shunting operations. However, in the same way it is also possible to use hydraulic motors and a hydraulic assembly which is fed by an electric motor or an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in rail car shunting device for road-rail operation, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, a rail car shunting device <b>1</b>, which may also be referred to as a rail car mover, a switching vehicle, or a road-rail vehicle, comprises a bogie <b>2</b> on which a total of four wheels are arranged which have rubber tires and which are each driven by an assigned drive motor <b>6</b>, in the form of motor wheel units <b>8</b> such as are known, for example, from fork lifts and stacker trucks. The motor wheel units <b>8</b> can pivot here about pivot axes that extend in the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by means of servomotors <b>10</b> which are assigned to each motor wheel unit <b>8</b>, in order to be able to steer the rail car shunting device <b>1</b> according to the invention in the road mode, for example when it moves up a run-up ramp onto the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>which are likewise indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For this purpose, it is possible to arrange on the rail car shunting device <b>1</b> a drawbar <b>14</b> which acts on the servomotors <b>10</b> via rotary encoders (not shown in more detail) and a control device (not shown in more detail) and activates the servomotors <b>10</b> in the horizontal direction, for example when the drawbar <b>14</b> pivots, in such a way that the motor wheel units <b>8</b> are correspondingly also pivoted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As can be also seen in the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each wheel is assigned a bolt element or guide bolt <b>16</b> which can be moved by means of an adjusting device <b>18</b> from a first retracted position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) for the road mode in which the ground-side end face of the bolt element situated above the rolling plane <b>5</b> of the wheels <b>4</b> which is defined by the upper side of the two rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, into a second deployed position for the rail mode, as is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this second position, the ground-side end faces of the bolt elements <b>16</b> are located underneath the rolling level <b>5</b> so that the external circumferential faces of the bolt elements have two wheels <b>4</b>, assigned to one another, of an imaginary axis of the rail car shunting device <b>1</b> extend at a small distance from one another on the inner lateral edges <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the two rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In the same way there is of course also the possibility of the bolt elements <b>16</b> extending down on the outer lateral edges of the rails in order to guide the rail car shunting device according to the invention along the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>in the rail mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bolt elements <b>16</b> are preferably composed of hardened steel and can have, for example, a diameter of 30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As can also be inferred from the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the adjusting device <b>18</b> acts via a pull rod <b>32</b> on a guide <b>22</b> which is mounted on the bogie <b>2</b>, and a support <b>24</b> which is guided in the guide <b>22</b> and movable in relation to it and on which the bolt element <b>16</b> is rotatably mounted in ball bearings <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A helical compression spring <b>28</b> which acts, on the one hand, on the upper side of the support <b>24</b> which faces away from the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>and on the inner side of the housing of the guide <b>22</b>, and applies a spring elastic force to the support <b>24</b>, and by means of the latter to the bolt element <b>16</b> in the direction of the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, is mounted between the support <b>24</b> and the guide <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to move the bolt element <b>16</b> from the retracted, first position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) into the deployed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) for the rail mode, the adjusting device <b>18</b>, which can comprise, for example, a pneumatic cylinder or else an electric servomotor, reduces its traction force on the support <b>24</b> which is transmitted to a plate-like head part via the pull rod <b>32</b> which engages through the guide <b>22</b>, so that the support <b>24</b>, and by means of it the bolt element <b>16</b>, is pushed in the direction of the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>within the guide <b>22</b> by the force of the helical spring <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the process, the movement of the support <b>24</b> in the second deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) is limited by a stop <b>30</b> which is provided only by way of example on the pull rod <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and which permits the helical spring <b>28</b> to act between the support <b>24</b> and guide <b>22</b> under prestress.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to a further alternative embodiment of the invention which is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, instead of the bolt element <b>16</b> which extends in the vertical direction a disk element <b>116</b> which is guided parallel to the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>is used. The latter can be moved, in the same way as the bolt element <b>16</b>, by means of the adjusting device <b>18</b> out of the first retracted position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) for the road mode, in which position the disk element <b>116</b> is located above the rolling level <b>5</b> and out of contact with the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, in the direction of the ground and into the second deployed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) for the rail mode.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For this purpose, the support <b>124</b> which is preferably configured in a fork shape in the manner of a rocker and guided in the guide <b>22</b> has, in the region of its ground-side end, a receptacle for a wheel axis <b>117</b> which, in the preferred embodiment, is rotatably mounted in the support <b>124</b> in ball bearings <b>126</b>. After the support <b>124</b> has been deployed into the second position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the disk element <b>116</b> extends at least with part of its lateral end face or edge face <b>121</b>, lying underneath the wheel axle <b>117</b>, along the inner lateral edges <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and/or the outer lateral edges of the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>in order to ensure, in the same way as in the previously described embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, that the shunting device <b>1</b> is guided along the rails <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. What has been stated above in relation to the activation of the bolt element <b>16</b> which extends in the vertical direction applies correspondingly also to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The necessary drive power may be supplied from an accumulator battery <b>35</b> and the operation is controlled by a control device <b>36</b>.</p>
