<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2003-410908 filed on Dec. 9, 2003 and 2004-332402 filed on Nov. 16, 2004, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a heat exchanger or a cooling module having the same, wherein the heat exchanger is used, for example, as a radiator for cooling down an engine cooling water for an internal combustion engine, or as a condenser for condensing refrigerant for a refrigerating cycle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known in the art, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-65694, that a heat exchanger comprises a core portion having multiple tubes and fins, which are alternately stacked in a vertical direction, a pair of reinforcing elements (side plates) provided at both vertical sides of the core portion, and mounting brackets fixed to the reinforcing elements for mounting the heat exchanger into an engine compartment of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the above prior art, the mounting bracket has a U-shape in its cross-section and opening to the reinforcing elements. A projection is formed on a flat bottom portion (first wall portion) of the mounting bracket. The mounting bracket has a pair of downwardly bent wall portions (second wall portions) formed with multiple mounting holes. Multiple mounting bolts are inserted through the mounting holes and fixing holes formed in the reinforcing elements, to fix the mounting brackets to the reinforcing elements by screwing the mounting bolts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this prior art, a lower rigidity portion (thin-walled portion) is formed in the mounting bracket adjacent to the mounting holes, so that the pair of the second wall portions are easily bent inwardly toward the reinforcing elements without a large screwing force. As a result, the second wall portions become in contact with the reinforcing elements and the mounting brackets are firmly fixed to the reinforcing elements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a vibration in the vertical direction is applied to the heat exchanger from the vehicle, the reinforcing elements as well as tubes and fins (which are horizontally extending) of the prior art are likely to be bent in the vertical direction. And stress generating at the reinforcing elements, at which the mounting brackets are fixed, becomes larger. As a result, it is necessary in the prior art, to form the reinforcing elements having a higher rigidity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a heat exchanger and a cooling module for a vehicle, which comprises a core portion of horizontally extending tubes and fins, which is mounted into an engine compartment of the vehicle by mounting brackets, and which has a high vibration proof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one of features of the present invention, a heat exchanger comprises; a pair of tanks made of a metal; multiple female screw nut portions provided in the tanks; and a core portion having multiple tubes and fins alternately stacked in a vertical direction, wherein both side ends of the tubes are connected to the tanks so that fluid flows from one of the tanks to the other tank through the multiple tubes. In the heat exchanger, multiple mounting brackets are fixed to the tanks by fixing means (such as bolts) screwed into the female screw nut portions provided in the tanks, and multiple mounting pins are formed in the brackets, with which the heat exchanger is mounted to a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the above feature, since a vibration from the vehicle in the vertical direction is transmitted through the multiple mounting brackets to the tanks, which have a higher rigidity, the heat exchanger has a higher vibration proof performance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another feature of the present invention, the female screw nut portion comprises; a cylindrical portion made of a metal; and a screw element screwed into the inside of the cylindrical portion, wherein the screw element is made of a different metal from the cylindrical portion and has a breaking force higher than that of the cylindrical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result, a number of screw heads can be reduced to achieve a size down of the female screw nut portions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further feature of the present invention, the present invention can be also applied to a cooling module having a radiator and a radiator fan device. In the cooling module, a shroud of the radiator fan device is divided into two parts in the vertical direction, each having a mounting portion fixed to the radiator at female screw nut portions provided in the tanks of the radiator. The mounting portions further have multiple mounting pins, which are formed adjacent to the female screw nut portions, and with which the cooling module is mounted to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the above feature, the mounting portions of the shroud are fixed to the tanks of the radiator, which have a higher rigidity, and thereby the cooling module has a higher vibration proof performance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, other portions of the shroud than those portions, at which the shroud is fixed to the tanks and the mounting pins are formed, can be made of thin-walled portions to achieve a light weight of the shroud.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A first embodiment of the present invention will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are a top plan view and a front view showing a heat exchanger, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view taken along a line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view showing a mounting bracket to be assembled to a radiator tank.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A heat exchanger <b>100</b> in the first embodiment is a radiator for cooling down an engine cooling water for an internal combustion engine. The radiator <b>100</b> is an aluminum type radiator comprising multiple tubes <b>110</b>, multiple fins <b>120</b>, a pair of radiator tanks <b>140</b> and so on, wherein those elements are made of aluminum or aluminum alloy and assembled and integrally fixed to each other by brazing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The radiator <b>100</b> is a cross-flow type heat exchanger, in which the multiple tubes <b>110</b> are horizontally arranged, and comprises a core portion <b>101</b> and the pair of the radiator tanks <b>140</b>. In the core portion <b>101</b>, the multiple tubes <b>110</b> and the multiple fins <b>120</b> are alternately stacked and a pair of side plates <b>130</b> of a U-shape in its cross section are provided at respective outermost fins <b>120</b> in its stacking direction. The stacking direction in this embodiment is a vertical direction. Further, in this embodiment, the side plates <b>130</b> serve as reinforcing members, and the core portion <b>101</b> operates as a heat radiating portion for cooling down the engine cooling water.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each of the tanks <b>140</b> is formed from a pair of L-shaped metal plates, which are connected to each other to form a tubular tank having a rectangular cross section. Both of open ends (vertical ends) <b>142</b> of the tanks <b>140</b> are closed by caps members <b>143</b>. The pair of tanks <b>140</b> are arranged that the longitudinal directions of the tanks <b>140</b> are coincide with the vertical direction. Both ends of the tubes <b>110</b> and side plates <b>130</b> are connected to side portions of the tanks <b>140</b>, so that the inside spaces of the tanks <b>140</b> are communicated with each other through the multiple tubes <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An inlet pipe <b>144</b> is provided at a middle portion of the tank <b>140</b> (the left-hand side tank <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), through which the engine cooling water flows into the tank <b>140</b>. A drain cock <b>146</b> is also provided in the inside of the tank <b>140</b>, to drain the engine cooling water to the outside of the tank <b>140</b>. An outlet pipe <b>145</b> is further provided at a lower portion of the other tank <b>140</b> (the right-hand side tank in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to discharge the engine cooling water.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Female screw nut portions <b>141</b> are provided at the respective caps <b>143</b>. And each of the screw nut portions <b>141</b> has a cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a</i>, a screwed portion <b>141</b><i>b </i>formed at an inner surface of the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a</i>, and a flange portion <b>141</b><i>c</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The female screw nut <b>141</b> has an open end at the flange portion <b>141</b><i>c </i>and a closed end opposite to the flange portion <b>141</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A recess portion <b>143</b><i>b </i>is formed on an outer side of the cap member <b>143</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, and the female screw nut <b>141</b> is inserted into a hole <b>143</b><i>c </i>formed in the cap member <b>143</b>, so that an outer end surface of the flange portion <b>141</b><i>c </i>may not protrude from an outer end surface <b>143</b><i>a </i>of the cap member <b>143</b>. In this embodiment, a thickness of the flange portion <b>141</b><i>c </i>is made to be equal to a depth of the recess portion <b>143</b><i>b</i>, so that the outer end surfaces of the flange portion <b>141</b><i>c </i>and the cap <b>143</b> are located on the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The radiator <b>100</b> is mounted in an engine compartment by means of mounting brackets, for example, by the mounting brackets <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The mounting bracket <b>10</b> comprises a disc-shape main body <b>11</b>, a mounting pin <b>12</b> provided at a center of the main body <b>10</b> on its one side, and a screw <b>13</b> also provided at the center of the main body <b>11</b> on the opposite side. The mounting bracket <b>10</b> is fixed to the radiator tank <b>140</b> by screwing the screw <b>13</b> into the screwed portion <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the female screw nut <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the radiator <b>100</b> is mounted in the engine compartment, the respective mounting pins <b>12</b> are fixed to an upper and a lower members of the engine compartment via rubber mounting elements (not shown). Accordingly, the radiator <b>100</b> is mounted in the engine compartment, being supported by the mounting pins at four points, namely respectively two points at an upper and lower vertical ends of the respective tanks <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the radiator <b>100</b>, the engine cooling water flows through the inlet pipe <b>144</b> into the (left) tank <b>140</b>, further flows to the other (right) tank <b>140</b> through the multiple tubes <b>110</b>, and discharged from the outlet pipe <b>145</b>, as in the well known manner. The engine cooling water is cooled down during its flow through the tubes <b>110</b> by radiating heat from the engine cooling water to the ambient air (cooling air).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A vibration in the vertical direction is mainly transmitted to the radiator <b>100</b> via the mounting brackets <b>10</b> during a vehicle running. According to the present invention, however, since the female screw nut portions <b>141</b> are provided at the upper and lower ends of the tanks <b>140</b>, and the mounting brackets <b>10</b> are connected to the screw nut portions <b>141</b>, the mounting brackets <b>10</b> can be easily fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> and the tanks <b>140</b> having higher rigidity than the other portions receive the vibration. As a result, a higher vibration proof can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, according to the above embodiment, the recess portion <b>143</b><i>a </i>is formed on the outer side of the cap member <b>143</b> and the outer side surface of the screw nut portion <b>141</b> does not protrude from the outer surface <b>143</b><i>a</i>of the cap member <b>143</b>. As a result, a compact size of the mounting portion can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The structure of the mounting bracket <b>10</b> shall not be limited to the mounting bracket <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A modification of the mounting bracket <b>10</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The bracket <b>10</b><i>a </i>comprises a main body <b>11</b> extending in a direction of the tubes <b>110</b>, three bent portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>formed at three outer peripheries of the main body <b>11</b>, to increase its rigidity, a counter boring <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the mounting pin <b>12</b> provided at a certain distance from the counter boring <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The bracket <b>10</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the tank <b>140</b> by screwing a bolt <b>400</b> into the counter boring <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the female screw nut portion <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this modification, since the screw nut portion <b>141</b> and the mounting pin <b>12</b> are connected via the mounting bracket <b>10</b><i>a </i>with a high rigidity, a higher vibration proof of the radiator <b>100</b> can be attained. And in addition, a flexibility of designing a position of the mounting pin to the screw nut portion <b>141</b> can be likewise increased.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the invention is applied to the radiator <b>100</b> in the above embodiment, the present invention can be applied to other heat exchangers, such as a condenser <b>300</b> (as explained below in the second embodiment).</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a dual type heat exchanger <b>100</b>A, in which a condenser <b>300</b> is integrally assembled to the radiator <b>100</b> of the above explained first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The condenser <b>300</b> is an aluminum heat exchanger for condensing a refrigerant for a vehicle refrigerating cycle. The basic structure of the condenser <b>300</b> is the same to that of the radiator <b>100</b>, namely the condenser <b>300</b> is of the cross flow type comprising a core portion <b>301</b> having multiple tubes <b>310</b> and multiple fins <b>320</b> and a pair of side plates <b>330</b>, and a pair of header tanks <b>340</b> of a cylindrical form.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A pair of cap members <b>341</b> are provided at both (upper and lower) ends of the header tanks <b>340</b>, for closing the both ends. Each of the cap members <b>341</b> is formed with an extending portion <b>342</b>, one side of which is brazed to the side plate <b>330</b> and a mounting pin <b>350</b> is formed on the other side of the extending portion. The cap members <b>341</b> are provided at the upper and lower ends of the header tanks <b>340</b> (four points).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A vertical dimension (height) of the condenser <b>300</b> is designed to be equal to or substantially similar to that of the radiator <b>100</b>. The condenser <b>300</b> and the radiator <b>100</b> are arranged in a line of the flow of the cooling air, and they are integrally assembled by multiple mounting brackets <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each of the mounting brackets <b>10</b><i>b </i>has a similar structure to the mounting bracket <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The main body <b>11</b> of the mounting bracket <b>10</b><i>b </i>has another extending portion extending in a direction to the condenser <b>300</b>. And a pin hole <b>11</b><i>c </i>is formed in the extending portion of the main body <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the mounting brackets <b>10</b><i>b </i>are fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> (to the screw nut portions <b>141</b>), the mounting pins <b>350</b> of the condenser <b>300</b> are at first inserted into the respective pin holes <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the mounting brackets <b>10</b><i>b </i>and then the brackets <b>10</b><i>b </i>are firmly fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> by bolts <b>400</b>, which are screwed into the female screw nut portions <b>141</b>. Accordingly, the dual type heat exchanger <b>100</b>A, in which the condenser <b>300</b> is integrally assembled to the radiator <b>100</b> is realized, in which a higher vibration proof of the radiator <b>100</b> can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The mounting pin <b>350</b> can be provided at a different position other than the extending portion of the cap member <b>341</b>. For example, as in the same manner of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mounting pin <b>350</b> can be provided at a center of the cap member <b>341</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A third embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a cross sectional view of the screw nut portion <b>141</b> of the first embodiment, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a modified screw nut portion. The modification aims at a size down of the screw nut portion.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The screw nut portion <b>141</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> comprises two different metal materials. As in the first embodiment, the screwed portion <b>141</b><i>b </i>is formed at the inner surface of the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a</i>. In addition, a screw element <b>141</b><i>d </i>having screwed portions on both outer and inner surfaces is screwed into the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a</i>, wherein a metal material for the screw element <b>141</b><i>d </i>is selected so that a breaking force for the screw element <b>141</b><i>d </i>is higher than a breaking force for the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a</i>. For example, the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a </i>is made of aluminum or aluminum alloy, while the screw element <b>141</b><i>d </i>is made of iron or steel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the above embodiment, a number of screw heads to be screwed together with the bolt <b>400</b> can be reduced because of the higher mechanical strength of the screw element <b>141</b><i>d</i>, and thereby a length L of the screw nut portion <b>141</b> can be shortened compared with the screw nut portion <b>141</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. As a consequence, a portion of the cylindrical portion <b>141</b><i>a </i>extending into the inside space of the tank <b>140</b> or the header tank <b>340</b> can be made smaller, reducing an unfavorable influence on a flow of the engine cooling water in the tank <b>140</b> or <b>340</b>.</p>

In this embodiment, however, the radiator fan device <b>200</b> is of a draw-in type, in which air is drawn by the fan <b>230</b> so that the cooling air flows from an upstream side of the condenser <b>300</b> through the condenser <b>300</b> and the radiator <b>100</b> to the fan <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The shroud <b>210</b> is made of a resin, such as polypropylene, by an injection molding process.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b> are arranged onto the lower frame <b>215</b>, wherein the lower frame <b>215</b> of the shroud <b>210</b> is fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> by the bolts (<b>400</b>) screwed into the female screw nut portions (<b>141</b>) through the pin holes <b>215</b><i>c</i>, and the condenser <b>300</b> is positioned in place by inserting the mounting pins <b>350</b> into the pin holes <b>215</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The upper frame <b>216</b> is then assembled to the lower frame <b>215</b>, wherein the upper frame <b>216</b> is fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> by the bolts <b>400</b> screwed into the female screw nut portions <b>141</b> of the radiator <b>100</b> through the pin holes <b>216</b><i>c</i>, and the condenser <b>300</b> is positioned in place by inserting the mounting pins <b>350</b> into the pin holes <b>216</b><i>d</i>. As a result, the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b> are tightly held by the shroud <b>210</b> (the lower and upper frames <b>215</b> and <b>216</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As above, the shroud <b>210</b> is integrally assembled to the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b> to form the cooling module <b>100</b>B, and then the cooling module <b>100</b>B is mounted into the engine compartment by the mounting pins <b>215</b><i>e </i>and <b>216</b><i>e</i>, respectively provided on the lower and upper frames <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> (the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a </i>and the top mounting portion <b>216</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As in the same manner to the first embodiment, the tanks <b>140</b> of the radiator <b>100</b>, which has a higher rigidity, receives the vertical vibration from the vehicle. As a result, a higher vibration proof can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, since the shroud <b>210</b> is tightly held by the tanks <b>140</b> of the radiator <b>100</b>, portions of the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a </i>and the top mounting portion <b>216</b><i>a </i>between the mounting pins <b>215</b><i>e </i>and <b>216</b><i>e </i>may not require a higher rigidity. Accordingly, the shroud <b>210</b> can be formed of thin walls or plates, achieving a light weight and a cost down of the shroud <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the above embodiment, since the shroud <b>210</b> is composed of two parts (lower and upper frames <b>215</b> and <b>216</b>) divided in the vertical direction, the shroud <b>210</b> can tolerate dimensional variations for the heights of the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b>, to improve an assembling efficiency. Furthermore, since spaces between the shroud <b>210</b> (the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a</i>, the top mounting portion <b>216</b><i>a</i>, and the side wall portions <b>215</b><i>b </i>and <b>216</b><i>b</i>) and the outer peripheries of the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b> can be made smaller, a bypassing flow of the cooling air through such spaces (bypassing the core portions of tubes <b>110</b> and fins <b>120</b>) can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the above embodiment, although the radiator fan device <b>200</b> is integrally assembled to the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b>, other variations can be likewise possible.

Although not shown in the drawing, multiple metal collars are likewise fixed to the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a </i>of the lower frame <b>215</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As in the same manner to the fourth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the shroud <b>210</b> is fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> by the bolts <b>400</b> screwed into the screw nut portions <b>141</b>, and the condenser <b>300</b> is tightly held by the shroud <b>210</b> by inserting the mounting pins <b>350</b> into the respective pin holes <b>215</b><i>d </i>and <b>216</b><i>d </i>of the lower and upper frames <b>215</b> and <b>216</b>, so that the cooling module <b>100</b>B is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As above, the cooling module <b>100</b>B of the sixth embodiment can achieve the same effect to the fourth embodiment, and in addition the screw nut portions <b>141</b> can be easily fixed to the tanks <b>140</b> because the tanks <b>140</b> are made of the resin material and the screw nut portions <b>141</b> are fixed to the tanks by the insert molding process.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A seventh embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in which air guide plates <b>217</b> are added to the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The air guide plates <b>217</b> are plate elements made of a resin material and have multiple holes <b>217</b><i>a</i>. Multiple holes <b>215</b><i>g </i>are also formed at the side wall portions <b>215</b><i>b </i>of the lower frame <b>215</b>, wherein the air guide plates <b>217</b> are fixed to the shroud <b>210</b> by multiple clip pins (not shown) inserted into the holes <b>217</b><i>a </i>of the air guide plates <b>217</b> and the corresponding holes <b>215</b><i>g </i>of the shroud <b>210</b>. The air guide plates <b>217</b> extend from the side wall portions <b>215</b><i>b </i>of the shroud <b>210</b> toward a front end of the vehicle, for example, a bumper opening or a front grille of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Accordingly, the air guide plates <b>217</b> effectively guide the cooling air coming from a front side of the vehicle toward the respective core portions <b>101</b> and <b>301</b> of the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b>, to improve their heat exchanging performances.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A configuration of a space between the cooling module (the radiator <b>100</b> and the condenser <b>300</b>) and the front end of the vehicle varies depending on vehicle models. And therefore, when the air guide plates <b>217</b> are made as separate elements from the shroud <b>210</b>, the same cooling module <b>100</b>B can be used to different vehicle models, by simply changing the air guide plates <b>217</b>. Furthermore, the air guide plates <b>217</b> can be so designed that the air guide plates <b>217</b> may be departed from the cooling module <b>100</b>B, at the points of the clip pins, by an impact strength at a vehicle crash. As a result, a damage to the cooling module <b>100</b>B can be avoided or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A modification of the seventh embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in which the side wall portions <b>215</b><i>b </i>are not formed at the shroud <b>210</b> (the lower frame <b>215</b> of the shroud <b>210</b>). In this case, the holes <b>215</b><i>g </i>and <b>216</b><i>g </i>are formed at the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a </i>and the top mounting portion <b>216</b><i>a </i>for fixing the air guide plates <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, corresponding holes <b>148</b><i>a </i>can be formed at over-hanging portions <b>148</b> of the tanks <b>140</b>, wherein the over-hanging portions <b>148</b> are integrally formed with the tanks <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The air guide plates <b>217</b> can be fixed to the shroud <b>210</b> or the tanks <b>140</b>, not only by the clip pins but by any other fixing means.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the above seventh embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, the air guide plates <b>217</b> are made as the different elements from the shroud <b>210</b>.

In such a modification, a low rigid portion (for example, a thin-walled portion) is purposefully formed at any relevant portion of the air guide plates, so that the air guide plates may be preferentially broken down at the vehicle crash, to thereby avoid and/or reduce a possible damage to the cooling module <b>100</b>B. When the air guide plates are integrally formed with the shroud or the radiator, a number of assembling processes can be reduced to achieve a cost down.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">One of the limit holes <b>216</b><i>i </i>(for example, the right-hand limit hole <b>216</b><i>i </i>on the top portion <b>216</b><i>a</i>) is a reference position hole, having an inner diameter of 4.6 mm, whereas the other (left-hand) limit hole <b>216</b><i>i </i>is a hole for limiting a displacement of the shroud <b>210</b> with respect to the radiator <b>100</b> in a direction of assembling the cooling module <b>100</b>B (as indicated by an arrow Y (an assembled direction) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). The other (left-hand) hole <b>216</b><i>i </i>is elongated in a direction (as indicated by an arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) of a line connecting the two limit holes <b>216</b><i>i</i>, and has an inside dimension of 4.6&#xd7;7.6 mm. The inside elongated length of 7.6 mm is so selected to tolerate variations of a distance (length B) between the limit pins <b>149</b> of the radiator <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the cooling module <b>100</b>B is assembled, the limit pins <b>149</b> are at first inserted into the limit holes <b>216</b><i>i</i>, and then the shroud <b>210</b> is fixed to the radiator <b>100</b> by inserting the bolts <b>400</b> through the collars <b>219</b> formed in the shroud <b>210</b> and screwed into the screw nut portions <b>141</b> formed on the radiator <b>100</b>. The condenser <b>300</b> is fixed to the shroud <b>210</b>, at the same time when the shroud <b>210</b> is fixed to the radiator <b>100</b>, wherein the mounting pins <b>350</b> of the condenser <b>300</b> are inserted into the pin holes (<b>216</b><i>d</i>) of the shroud <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The hole <b>216</b><i>c </i>(and <b>215</b><i>c</i>) formed by the collars <b>219</b>, through which the bolt <b>400</b> is inserted for fixing the shroud <b>210</b> to the radiator <b>100</b>, has an inner diameter larger than an outer diameter of the bolt <b>400</b> to tolerate the variations of the distance (length B) between the centers of the both collars <b>219</b> formed on the top mounting portion <b>216</b><i>a </i>(as well as the bottom mounting portion <b>215</b><i>a</i>). For example, in this embodiment, the inner diameter of the hole <b>216</b><i>c </i>(and <b>215</b><i>c</i>) is 10.0 mm, whereas the outer diameter of the bolt <b>400</b> is 6.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the case that the limit pins <b>149</b> and limit holes <b>216</b><i>i </i>were not provided, the maximum displacement of the shroud <b>210</b> with respect to the radiator <b>100</b> would be theoretically 4.0 mm in both directions X and Y.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">According to the above ninth embodiment, however, the displacement of the shroud <b>210</b> with respect to the radiator <b>100</b> in the direction Y is limited by the engagement of the limit pins <b>149</b> with the limit holes <b>216</b><i>i</i>, the amount of the displacement in the direction Y is suppressed to a smaller amount (0.6 mm=4.6 mm&#x2212;4.0 mm). As a result, a displacement of the condenser <b>300</b> with respect to the radiator <b>100</b> in the direction Y is likewise limited to the smaller amount (substantially equal to the displacement amount of the shroud <b>210</b> with respect to the radiator <b>100</b>). Accordingly, the cooling module <b>100</b>B has a smaller variation in its length of the direction Y, which is preferable when the cooling module <b>100</b>B is mounted into the limited space of the engine compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the above embodiments, the screw nut portions <b>141</b>, the limit pins <b>149</b>, and the limit holes <b>216</b><i>i </i>are formed at the vertical ends of the tanks <b>140</b>. It is, however, also possible to form those screw nut portions, limit pins, and the limit holes at horizontal side surface portions of the tanks <b>140</b>, additionally to or instead of those elements at the vertical ends, so that the displacement in the vertical direction can be likewise limited to the smaller amount.</p>
