<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cutting tool and, more particularly, to a pair of gardening shears for cutting and trimming a plant, such as a tree, flower and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pair of conventional gardening shears in accordance with the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> comprises two cutting blades <b>10</b> pivotally connected with each other by a screw <b>13</b> and a nut <b>14</b>, two handles <b>11</b> each mounted on a lower end of a respective cutting blade <b>10</b>, and two limit posts <b>15</b> each mounted on a respective handle <b>11</b> and movable to abut each other. Each of the cutting blades <b>10</b> is formed with a through hole <b>12</b> to allow passage of the screw <b>13</b>. Thus, the cutting blades <b>10</b> are pivoted about the screw <b>13</b> which functions as a pivot fulcrum of the cutting blades <b>10</b>. However, the screw <b>13</b> is easily unscrewed from the nut <b>14</b> due to a frequent friction so that the cutting blades <b>10</b> are easily loosened from each other, thereby producing a gap <b>1</b> between the cutting blades <b>10</b>, thereby causing inconvenience to the user when operating the cutting blades <b>10</b>. In addition, the screw <b>13</b> functions as a pivot fulcrum of the cutting blades <b>10</b> so that the cutting blades <b>10</b> only has a single pivot fulcrum and are easily jammed during a pivot movement of the cutting blades <b>10</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a pair of gardening shears, comprising two cutting blades pivotally connected with each other, two movable members each having a first side mounted on a respective cutting blade, two fixing members each mounted on a second side of a respective movable member, two locking bolts each extended through the fixing members, the movable members and the cutting blades, and two locking nuts each screwed onto a respective locking bolt so that the fixing members, the movable members and the cutting blades are locked between the locking bolts and the locking nuts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a pair of gardening shears without producing a gap between two cutting blades of the gardening shears.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a pair of gardening shears, wherein the cutting blades are limited by the fixing members and the locking bolts so that the cutting blades are juxtaposed to each other closely without producing a gap between the cutting blades, thereby greatly facilitating a user operating the gardening shears.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a pair of gardening shears, wherein the cutting blades are pivoted about the pivot holes respectively so that the pivot holes function as two pivot fulcrums of the cutting blades to facilitate pivot movement of the cutting blades, thereby preventing the cutting blades from being jammed during the pivot movement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a pair of gardening shears, wherein the cutting blades are guided by the guide slots respectively, so that the cutting blades are pivoted smoothly and stably, thereby facilitating the user operating the gardening shears.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a pair of gardening shears, wherein the catch face of each of the movable members is movable to rest on the stop face of the respective fixing member, thereby preventing the cutting blades from being pivoted excessively.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to the drawings and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a pair of gardening shears in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention comprise two cutting blades <b>20</b> pivotally connected with each other, two movable members <b>30</b> each having a first side mounted on a respective cutting blade <b>20</b>, two fixing members <b>40</b> each mounted on a second side of a respective movable member <b>30</b>, two locking bolts <b>60</b> each extended through the fixing members <b>40</b>, the movable members <b>30</b> and the cutting blades <b>20</b>, two locking nuts <b>70</b> each screwed onto a respective locking bolt <b>60</b> so that the fixing members <b>40</b>, the movable members <b>30</b> and the cutting blades <b>20</b> are locked between the locking bolts <b>60</b> and the locking nuts <b>70</b>, and two elastic members <b>50</b> each biased between a respective movable member <b>30</b> and a respective fixing member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each of the cutting blades <b>20</b> has a mediate portion formed with a pivot portion <b>21</b>, and the pivot portions <b>21</b> of the cutting blades <b>20</b> are pivotally connected with each other by the locking bolts <b>60</b> and the locking nuts <b>70</b>. The pivot portion <b>21</b> of each of the cutting blades <b>20</b> is formed with a pivot hole <b>22</b>, an elongated guide slot <b>23</b> and a locking hole <b>24</b>. The guide slot <b>23</b> of each of the cutting blades <b>20</b> has a substantially arc-shaped profile, and the pivot hole <b>22</b> of each of the cutting blades <b>20</b> functions as a pivot center of the guide slot <b>23</b>. The pivot hole <b>22</b> and the guide slot <b>23</b> of a first one of the cutting blades <b>20</b> align with the guide slot <b>23</b> and the pivot hole <b>22</b> of a second one of the cutting blades <b>20</b> respectively.</p>
