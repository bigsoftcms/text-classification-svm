<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A 360&#xb0; tool for making a one-piece composite tubular structure, such as a skin of an acoustic liner, is adjustable between a molding position and a non-molding position. The tool includes a base, a fixed segment mounted to the base, first and second doors hingedly connected on either side of the fixed sector, and third door hingedly connected to the second door. The third door has a circumferential extent that is less than one-fourth that of either the first or second door. Sealing members are provided between the doors. Collectively, the fixed sector, and the first, second and third doors have a predetermined shaped surface that corresponds to a portion of the contour of the tubular structure to be formed. After composite material is applied on the outer surfaces of the fixed sector and the doors, a vacuum bag is formed to surround the composite material and also the joint areas on the inner surface of the tool. The entire tool may be placed in an autoclave for curing. The tool may also be used for the layup and bonding of an acoustic core sandwiched between pre-cured skins.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">None.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a method and apparatus for making tubular composite articles, such as an acoustic liner for an aircraft nacelle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An acoustic inlet barrel for a nacelle inlet may comprise a number of layers, including a perforated inner skin, an acoustic core, and an impervious outer skin. Typically, the inner skin is formed from sectors that are bolted together at axially extending seams. Ideally, however, the perforated skin has no internal seams or other features which may degrade the acoustic performance of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,237 discloses a tool for molding an air intake, and more specifically for forming a one-piece inner skin having no internal seams. The tool comprises a mandrel having four arcuate sectors, a fixed sector that does not move during normal operation to the tool, two movable articulated sectors each hingedly connected to either side of the first sector; and a movable key sector which is independent from the other sectors and insertable between the articulated sectors. By virtue of the hinges, the articulated sectors remain connected to the fixed sector and cannot be separated therefrom. Locks are provided to secure the key sector to the articulated sectors. When in the molding position, the four sectors together define, by their external surfaces, a continuous surface corresponding to the internal surface of an air intake. A control device, disconnectable from the mandrel, may be used to adjust the movable sectors between a molding position and an non-molding position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007/0062022 discloses a tool for making a composite tubular structure. The tool includes a base on which are mounted a plurality of sectors, each sector having an outer panel provided with a predetermined shaped surface. The predetermined shaped surface corresponds to a portion of the contour of the tubular structure to be formed. At least one of the sectors is fixed relative to the base while the remaining sectors are movable in a radial direction and separable from all the other sectors. The sectors are provided with air bearings to facilitate movement along a radial direction. Splice plates are used to form a joint between the outer panels of adjacent sectors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a tool for making a tubular composite barrel, the tool being adjustable between a molding position and a non-molding position. Such a tool includes a base, at least one fixed segment that is fixed relative to the base, the at least one fixed segment having a first circumferential end and a second circumferential end, a first door having a first circumferential end hingedly connected to the first circumferential end of the at least one fixed segment, a second door having a first circumferential end hingedly connected to the second circumferential end of the at least one fixed segment, and a third door hingedly connected to the second door and configured to fit between the second door and first door and complete the 360&#xb0; circumferential extent of the tool. A sealing member is positioned between the at least one fixed segment and each of the first and second doors, and also between each of the first and second doors and the third door. In such a tool, the third door has a circumferential extent no greater than one-quarter of a circumferential extent of the smaller of the first and second doors. The base may be formed from a first material, with the at least one fixed segment, and the first, second and third doors are all formed from a second material different from the first material.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The contents of aforementioned U.S. published Patent Application No. 2007/0062022 are incorporated by reference to the extent necessary to understand the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show two perspective views of a tool <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the tool is in the &#x201c;molding&#x201d; state&#x2014;i.e., the tool <b>100</b> is ready to have one or more layers of composite material applied to its axially extending tubular exterior surface to form a tubular composite member, such as an inner skin of an acoustic inner barrel for an aircraft gas turbine engine. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the tool <b>100</b> in the &#x201c;collapsed&#x201d; state, in which a tubular composite member formed on the tool may be removed from the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The tool <b>100</b> comprises a base <b>110</b> on which is mounted a tubular molding assembly <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, the base has a diameter of approximately 3.4 meters while the height of the tool, including the base, is approximately 3.1 meters.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the base <b>110</b> is circular in shape and comprises an upper surface <b>192</b> and a skirt <b>194</b> extending downwardly therefrom. A set of four wheels <b>196</b> is attached to the bottom of the base <b>110</b> to help roll the base along a floor or other surface on which the base <b>110</b> rests. The base <b>110</b> is also provided with at least one pair of rectangular tubular members <b>198</b>, each tubular member traversing the base <b>110</b> in a chord-like manner. The tubular members <b>198</b> are configured and dimensioned to serve as forklift receiving structures suitable for receiving forklift prongs, to facilitate lifting and transporting the base <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> comprises a fixed segment <b>200</b>, and three movable segments <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>. In this context, the term &#x201c;fixed segment&#x201d; refers to a segment which, in normal use for molding and curing operations, is fixed relative to the base <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, movable segments <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> are configured as a first door <b>210</b>, a second door <b>220</b> and a third door <b>230</b>, respectively. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the fixed segment <b>200</b> rests on fixed segment support <b>202</b> which comprises a fixed segment support base <b>348</b>; the first door <b>210</b> rests on first door support <b>212</b> which comprises a first door support base <b>448</b>; and the second door <b>220</b> rests on second door support <b>222</b> which comprises a second door support base <b>548</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first door <b>210</b> is hingedly connected at one circumferential end to a first, opposing circumferential end of the fixed segment <b>200</b>. Similarly, second door <b>220</b> is hingedly connected at one circumferential end to a second, opposing circumferential end of the fixed segment <b>200</b>. The third door <b>230</b> is hingedly connected to the second door <b>220</b>, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During normal use, a door <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> is considered to occupy a &#x2018;molding position&#x2019; when it is closed, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and is considered to occupy a &#x2018;retracted position&#x2019; whenever it is moved in an inward direction relative to its &#x2018;molding position&#x2019;, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the present application, we refer to the entire tool as being in a &#x2018;molding position&#x2019; when all of the doors are closed; we refer to the entire tool as being in a &#x201c;collapsed position&#x201d; when any one of the doors is opened; and we refer to the tool as being in an &#x201c;non-molding position&#x201d; when all of doors have been opened.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the base <b>110</b> is formed from steel while the tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> is formed from a different material. In general, the tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> is formed from a material which has a thermal properties that are similar to that the material to be formed on the tool, over a temperature range to which the assembly is exposed during normal use. In one embodiment, the tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> is formed from INVAR 36&#xae; or other material having a coefficient of thermal expansion that is similar to that of a graphite-epoxy composite part that is to be molded on the tool. Having similar thermal coefficients of expansion of the tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> and such a part eliminates different thermal expansion rates which otherwise would cause thermal loading between the part and the tool during heating and/or cooling, resulting in damage to the part. In one non-limiting example, the thermal coefficients of expansion of the tubular molding assembly <b>105</b> and the graphite-epoxy composite part formed thereon differ by less than 10% over the temperature range to which the assembly is exposed during normal use. Furthermore, a base formed from steel is less costly than a base formed from a material such as INVAR 36&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fixed segment <b>200</b> and each of the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> has an outer surface provided with a predefined contour which conforms to a corresponding portion of the composite tubular structure to be formed using the tool <b>100</b>. The third door <b>230</b> fits between facing edges of the first door <b>210</b> and the second door <b>220</b>. And as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the outer surface of the third door <b>230</b> forms a portion of an outer contour of the tool, when the tool is in the molding position. The third door <b>230</b> is constructed and arranged to provide the exterior of the tool <b>100</b> with a smooth outer surface in the region between the first door <b>210</b> and the second door <b>220</b>. One way to characterize the smoothness of the outer surface at the interface between the third door <b>230</b> and either the first door <b>210</b> or the second door <b>220</b>, is with reference to the maximum step difference along the abutting edges. Minimizing the step difference helps promote the aerodynamic properties of the completed part. In one embodiment, this step difference is less than about 0.05 cm. More preferably, however, the step difference is on the order of less than 0.005 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The third door <b>230</b> should be smaller than either the first or second doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. In part, one function of third door <b>230</b> may be to break surface tension of a cured product by initiating separation between the cured product and the outer surface of the tool mandrel on which it is formed. Thus, the size of the third door may be dictated by the surface area required to break tension, and this may depend on the size of the tool. Thus, for example, the third door <b>230</b> may subtend a smaller circumferential extent in a tool with a larger diameter, than in a tool with a smaller diameter. Furthermore, the third door <b>230</b> must provide enough clearance to allow the second door <b>220</b> to move past the end of the first door <b>210</b>, in view of the contours of the first and second doors.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the fixed segment <b>200</b> subtends between 160&#xb0; and 180&#xb0;, though more preferably is closer to 180&#xb0;. In one preferred embodiment of the tool <b>100</b>, the fixed segment <b>20</b> subtends just under 180&#xb0;, the first door <b>210</b> and second door <b>220</b> each subtend approximately, 87&#xb0;, and the third door <b>230</b> subtends approximately 6&#xb0;. Thus, in a tool having a diameter of 300 cm (3 meters) at a point midway between the tool's upper and lower rims, the third door <b>230</b> has a medial circumferential extent of approximately 15 cm. In other embodiments, the third door <b>230</b> subtends between 3&#xb0;-9&#xb0; out of the full 360&#xb0; extent of the tool <b>100</b>. In still other embodiments, the third door <b>230</b> has a circumferential extent no greater than one-quarter of a circumferential extent of the smaller of the first door <b>210</b> and the second doors <b>220</b>. More preferably, though, the third door <b>230</b> has a circumferential extent no greater than one-tenth of a circumferential extent of the smaller of the first door <b>210</b> and the second door.</p>

The sealing structure <b>340</b><i>a </i>and the flexible sealing member <b>390</b> together form a sealing arrangement. When the tool is in the molding portion, this sealing arrangement helps form a seal between adjacent segments. It is therefore understood that the interface between the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the first door <b>210</b> has such a sealing arrangement, as does the interface between the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the second door <b>210</b>. A similar sealing arrangement is also provided at the interface between the first door <b>210</b> and the third door <b>230</b>, and at the interface between the second door <b>220</b> and the third door <b>230</b>. In one embodiment, as described above, the grooves are formed on both circumferentially facing panels <b>338</b><i>a</i>, <b>338</b><i>b </i>of the fixed segment <b>200</b>, on the first door's circumferentially facing panel <b>438</b><i>c </i>that faces the third door <b>230</b>, and on the second door's circumferentially facing panel <b>538</b><i>d </i>that faces the third door <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 16</figref>, when the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are in the closed position, notches <b>120</b> are formed between the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the first door <b>210</b>, and also between the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the second door <b>220</b>. Each notch <b>120</b> is created when cutouts <b>126</b> formed at the top and bottom corners of the fixed segment <b>200</b> and at the corresponding facing corners of the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are brought together when the doors are closed. The notches <b>120</b> facilitate the use of vacuum bagging in the event the compressible seals fail. More particularly, the notches are regions where ends of polymer films for vacuum bagging meet to seal the composite material, prior to and during curing, in a manner known to those skilled in the art. A cover member <b>370</b> is provided to protect plastic bags during vacuum sealing from sharp edges at the interface between the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the first door <b>210</b></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the foregoing discussion, one fixed segment and three movable segments in the form of three doors were employed, the smallest door being substantially smaller than either of the other two doors. It is also possible to form a tool with one fixed segment and two movable segments (doors), one door being larger than the other door. In such case, the larger of the two doors is hingedly connected at a first circumferential end to a first circumferential end of the fixed segment. A first circumferential end of the smaller of the two doors is then hingedly connected to the larger door's second circumferential end. In the completed tool, the second circumferential end of the smaller of the two doors meets the second circumferential end of the fixed segment to thereby form the 360&#xb0; tool. Sealing arrangements including grooves and sealing members as described above may be provided at the three interfaces. In one such three-segment embodiment, the fixed portion may again subtend roughly 180&#xb0;, the first (larger) hinged door may subtend about 144&#xb0;-164&#xb0; and the second (smaller) hinged door (may subtend the remainder of about 16&#xb0;-36&#xb0; (or roughly one-quarter to one-tenth the size of the larger door). The non-right-cylindrical geometry of the tool may determine whether or not such a three-segment section is at all possible, and may also help determine the size for the smaller door.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">To form a composite tubular structure, the tool <b>100</b> is adjusted to the molding position and composite material is applied in a pre-determined horizontal band between the upper and lower edges of the fixed segment <b>200</b> and the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>. After the composite material has been applied, it is covered with plastic film and vacuum sealed. The plastic film is placed on the outside of the tool over the composite material, and also on the inside of the tool over the interface regions between the various segments <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An upper bead of sealant and a lower bead of sealant may be circumferentially applied around the outer surface of the tool <b>100</b> to adhere the plastic film to the tool <b>100</b>. As is known to those skilled in the art, vacuum bag sealant tape (two-sided &#x201c;chromate tape&#x201d; with peel-off backing on both sides), such as model no. GS 213-3, available from General Sealants of Industry, Calif. may be suitable for use as sealant beads.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With the beads of sealant applied to secure the plastic film, a first portion of polymer film, such as a nylon film, may then be placed on the outer surface of the tool <b>100</b>. This first portion of film is a single piece that extends around the entire circumference of the tool and is overlapped in the circumferential direction by 2-3 centimeters or so, the overlapping ends secured by an axially extending piece of chromate tape. This first portion of nylon film is of sufficient height to contact the upper and lower beads. Preferably, the upper edge of the nylon film extends above the upper bead around the entire circumference of the tool, while the lower edge of the first portion of nylon film extends below the lower bead around the entire circumference of the tool. The first portion of the film also extends across each notch <b>120</b>, and is secured to those portions of the beads that extend across each notch. In one embodiment, an IPPLON&#xae; KM 1300 nylon film, available from Airtech International, Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif. may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Second portions of nylon film, which are sized to cover each of the interface regions between the segments may optionally be applied on the inside surface of the tool <b>100</b> and are secured to the first portion of nylon film via beads at the notches, in a known manner. As a result, the first film portion and the second film portion may sealingly join and engage each other. This serves as a backup in case the sealing members <b>390</b> fail. In this manner, a vacuum bag is formed, the vacuum bag creating a seal around the interface regions and the adjoining areas where the edges of the segments <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> are present.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An exemplary use of the tool <b>100</b> is presented next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This exemplary use illustrates one embodiment of a process <b>800</b> for making a composite inner skin of a 360&#xb0; acoustic inner barrel for a nacelle inlet, using the tool <b>100</b>. The process entails a number of phases: tool surface preparation <b>802</b>; tool assembly <b>804</b>; application of composite material <b>806</b>; preparation for curing <b>808</b>; curing in an autoclave <b>810</b>; and composite inner skin removal <b>812</b>.

</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">After the tool <b>100</b> is assembled, composite material is applied to the external surface of the tool in a conventional lay-up process and compacted by vacuum. The composite material application and compaction process <b>806</b> entails:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0082">(1) Laying on plies of composite material in the form of graphite-epoxy prepreg fabric on the tool's outer surface. Segments of the fabric about 1.1 meters in height, each circumferentially subtending about 60&#xb0;, are placed on the outer surface of the tool, adjacent segments overlapping one another by about 2-3 cm. No tape or adhesives are used to secure overlapping fabric segments since they may contaminate the final composite structure. About 3 or 4 such plies are laid on at a time;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0083">(2) Applying two-sided vacuum bag sealant tape around the top and bottom peripheries of the outer surface of the tool and along the interface areas on the inner surface of the tool to form the sealant bead. The two-sided tape is applied to the outer surface of the tool, and not to the surface of the composite material. On the outer surface of the tool, a gap of about 13 to 18 cm is left between the circumferentially extending upper and lower edges of the composite material and the circumferentially extending upper and lower sealant beads;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0084">(3) Applying polymer film to form a first vacuum bag around the fabric and along the interface areas. A first portion of polymer film is wrapped around the circumference of the tool such that it contacts and seals against the upper lower beads of sealant tape in the manner described above. Additionally, second portions of polymer film may optionally be applied to form a seal with a corresponding one of the tape beads that extend around each interface area on the inside surface of the tool, in the manner described above. In such case, the first portion of polymer film sealingly engages the second portions of polymer film at each notch pair;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0085">(4) Compacting the plies against the tool surface by applying a vacuum to the first vacuum bag. A metal fitting is installed on the vacuum bag, such as by taping with sealant tape, a first end of a hose is connected to the fitting and a second end of the hose is connected to a vacuum pump. The suction exerted by the vacuum pump is sufficient to compact the composite material. Therefore, no mechanical pressure other than that provided by the plastic film of the vacuum bag pressing against the composite material is needed to perform the compaction; and</li>

<p id="p-0079" num="0103">It is understood that there may be other steps in each of the above-described phases. It is also understood that the some of the steps in one or more of the above-described phases may be taken out of the sequence presented above.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104">Once the composite inner skin is formed, it generally is subject to additional processing, such as perforation for acoustic attenuation.

<p id="p-0081" num="0105">A bond panel for an acoustic inner barrel may be formed by bonding together the composite inner skin, the acoustic core and the outer skin, with help of the tool <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a process <b>900</b> to accomplish this. First, in step <b>902</b>, the composite inner skin is placed over a slightly collapsed tool <b>100</b> and the tool is then adjusted to the molding position such that the outer surface of the tool supports the inner skin. As indicated by preliminary step <b>899</b>, the composite inner skin may first have been molded on the tool, the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> opened and the composite inner skin removed from the tool <b>100</b>, and only then subsequently repositioned on the tool <b>100</b>. Next, in step <b>904</b>, the acoustic core (e.g., honeycomb core typically used in engine nacelles) is positioned over the composite inner skin and bonded thereto. After this, in step <b>906</b>, the outer skin is positioned over the acoustic core and bonded thereto. In step <b>908</b>, the resulting assembly is then cured in an autoclave. Finally, in step <b>910</b>, the bonded inner skin/core/outer skin assembly is removed from the tool. People skilled in the art understand how to bond adjacent layers for such an acoustic liner.</p>
