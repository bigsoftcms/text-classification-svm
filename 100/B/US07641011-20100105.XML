<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pallet jack includes a frame and a pair of outwardly projecting load prongs connected to the frame. The proximal ends of the prongs are connected to a horizontal member on the rear of the frame by brackets that keep the prongs out of the frame proper. A threaded rod is mounted horizontally on the horizontal member and is threaded into the proximal end of each prong, with the two ends of the threaded rod having opposite hand threads. The threaded rod is rotated by a user turning a crank mounted on top of the frame and connected to the adjustment threaded rod by a chain drive, allowing the width between the prongs to be adjusted inwardly or outwardly.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pallet jacks for moving a single pallet are well known. Pallets suitable for use with a pallet jack typically include an upper load bearing sheet of material and a lower load bearing sheet of material that are parallel to one another, are of the same size and have vertically aligned perimeters. The upper and lower sheets are spaced apart a few centimeters and fixed in their spacial relationship by a number of spaced connected frame members. Either sheet of material may serve as the top sheet, upon which a load is placed. The prongs of a pallet jack are inserted into the spaces between the frame members to permit the load to be lifted by a desired amount for ready transport from one location to another. Typically two parallel outwardly extending prongs forming a single fork are employed on pallet jacks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically such pallet jacks include a frame supported by a truck with a jack housed in the frame and an elongated pulling handle pivotally connected to the frame. A pair of spaced parallel prongs form a fork that extends outwardly from the frame in a direction opposite of the handle. One or more small wheels or rollers support the distal ends of the prongs against a smooth surface such as a concrete floor. The jack, which is typically a hydraulic bottle jack, is raised by pumping the handle up and down, causing the base of the jack to bear against the truck, which is typically a two-wheeled truck, and upward against the top of the frame, lifting the fork off the ground and allowing it to be slipped into the space between the upper and lower pallet surfaces and between the frame members of the pallet. The load rollers, located toward the outer ends of the prongs, remain in constant contact with the floor or ground allowing the loaded pallet jack to be easily moved about.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pallet jacks designed to hold a single pallet at a time can be moved by a person pulling on the handle or by an electric motor, methane motor or the like. Such pallet jacks can carry up to about 2,300 kg (5,000 pound) loads.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although many pallets are built in standard dimensions, no uniform specifications exist. Some pallets, for example, may be specifically designed and built for a specific application or specific goods. As a result, pallets of many different sizes may be found at a single site, such as a warehouse. In many cases where operators need to move a single pallet and many different sized pallets are found, the operation has several different pallet jacks, each having a different spacing between the two prongs of its fork. This solution requires significant additional capital expenditures and results in lost time because the workers must locate and retrieve the correct sized pallet jack for each different pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When high lifting is required, such as to deposit or retrieve a pallet from a shelf or stack several feet above the floor, a fork-lift truck is typically used. Different sized pallets cause the same problems for fork-lift trucks as for pallet jacks and addressing this problem has led to some patents that disclose different means for adjusting the distance between the prongs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,190,436 B1, issued to Sorlie on Mar. 2, 1993, discloses a Carriage Assembly Having Side Shiftable and Adjustable Forks comprising a fork lift truck and having a pair of outwardly extending prongs defining a fork. The spacing between the prongs can be changed by horizontally mounted hydraulic jacks fixed to vertical portions of the prongs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,363 B1, issued to Weinert et al. on Mar. 17, 1992, discloses a Multiple-Pair Fork Positioner comprising a fork lift truck having two pairs of prongs, and outer pair and an inner pair. The spacing between the outer prongs can be adjusted by horizontally mounted positioning hydraulic actuators. The spaced relationship between the inner forks and the outer forks is mechanically determined.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,290 B1, issued to Hackauf on Aug. 6, 1985, discloses a Fort-Lift Attachment with Four Laterally Displaceable Prongs comprising an attachment for a forklift truck that is fixed to an existing vertical lifting plate and two pairs of space outwardly projecting prongs, with each prong connected to a vertical member. The spacing between the two sets of prongs can be adjusted using horizontally mounted hydraulic jacks.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the three above references includes limitations that cannot be used in a pallet jack. Each solution is too heavy and powerful and expensive for use on a pallet jack. They also depend on having a vertical portion of each prong mounted onto a vertically oriented reinforcing frame, requiring strength and space not available in a pallet jack.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">References to a pallet jack having prongs that can be spread farther apart or brought closer together have not been found. In a related field, however, hand trucks having width adjustable means have been located and include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,493, issued to Lucy on Jun. 27, 1995, discloses a Hand Truck with Horizontally Spreadable Arms comprising a two-wheeled hand truck having a horizontally mounted hand crank about half-way up the frame members which drives a chain <b>14</b>. The chain drive turns an upper sprocket and a lower sprocket, which drives a pair of horizontal screws, which are joined into one bar with floating nuts <b>42</b> that laterally move in opposite directions along the screws, to move the gripping extensions, i.e., a load platform, farther apart or closer together.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,592,644, issued to Bartlett on Apr. 15, 1952, discloses a Hand Truck comprising a hand crank that pushes down or pulls up on a transfer plate, which is pivotally connected to a pair of arms that then toggle inward and outward to drive apart or pull together the forks on the hand truck.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,500,047, issued to Smith on Mar. 7, 1950, discloses an Adjustable Clamp Truck that is somewhat similar to Bartlett '664 above in that the arms are mechanically driven through a vertical screw and connected pivoting complex mechanical linkages to move the jaws <b>42</b> into clamping or release position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,367,752, issued to Broome on Jan. 23, 1945, discloses a Hand Truck comprising a vertically mounted screw that moves vertical sleeves up and down, with one sleeve floating up and down the un-threaded shaft, while the lower sleeve is actively driven by the screw threads. Pivoting levers arranged in a mechanical linkage drive a set of arms farther apart or closer together, thereby driving the prongs of the hand truck farther apart or closer together.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,109,305, issued to Stine on Feb. 22, 1938, discloses a Clamp Truck comprising a pair of operating arms that have a ball on their lower ends, with each ball being received into a groove in the prongs. The top ends of the operating arms are sleeves that move along the hand crank operated shaft. When the sleeves are brought closer together, the prongs move farther apart and visa versa or grip or release an object. A handle <b>28</b> can be pushed to grip an object or to release an object.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Because hand trucks typically include a vertical frame that the load leans against when the hand truck is in use, the hand truck provides a good deal of space for a vertically oriented control apparatus for spreading apart a load bearing arms in the horizontal base plate area of a hand truck. Because a pallet truck does not provide this vertically oriented space, the extensive mechanical linkages, vertically aligned driving mechanisms and the like are not available for use on a pallet jack.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore a need exists for a pallet jack having width-adjustable fork prongs having prongs that can be spread farther apart or brought closer together; that can be quickly and readily adjusted by a single user; that is set into a desired position after adjustment; that prevents the prongs from being set so close together that a load will cause the pallet jack to tip; and that can be used quickly and easily with minimal training because the adjustment and operation of the pallet jack are simple.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pallet jack having width-adjustable fork prongs (pallet jack) <b>10</b> according to the present invention includes a frame <b>12</b> having a two-wheeled pivoting truck <b>14</b> connected to it. An elongated handle <b>16</b> is mounted for pivoting movement up and down along the directions of the double-headed arrow <b>18</b> at the pivot point <b>20</b> and from side-to-side along the direction of the double-headed arrow <b>22</b>. Adjacent to the proximal end <b>24</b> of the handle <b>16</b> is a bow-shaped gripping handle <b>26</b> with a pressure release control valve trigger <b>28</b>, which releases pressure in the hydraulic bottle jack <b>30</b> allowing the pallet jack <b>10</b> to lower into its normal position via a control cable connected to the pressure release valve on the hydraulic bottle jack <b>30</b>. The piston on the hydraulic bottle jack <b>30</b> pushes upward on the frame cap <b>32</b> when the piston is extended, lifting the entire pallet jack <b>10</b> upward and off the floor <b>34</b>, with the pallet jack <b>10</b> supported by the truck <b>14</b> and the load rollers xx.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the left-side prong <b>36</b> and the right-side prong <b>38</b> of the fork assembly <b>40</b> are lifted off the floor <b>34</b>. Handedness is determined from an operator a the proximal end <b>24</b> of the handle <b>26</b> facing the prongs of the fork <b>40</b>. Similarly, &#x201c;front&#x201d; refers to a part or surface or portion of the pallet jack <b>10</b> nearer to an operator standing at the handle <b>26</b> and &#x201c;rear&#x201d; refers to a part of surface or portion of the pallet jack <b>10</b> farther from the operator standing at the handle <b>26</b>. The left-side prong <b>36</b> includes a distal end <b>42</b> and a proximal end <b>44</b>, while the right-side prong <b>38</b> includes a distal end <b>46</b> and a proximal end <b>48</b>. Each distal end <b>42</b>, <b>46</b> includes a rounded tapered arrowhead toe portion <b>50</b>, which facilitates insertion of the toe portions <b>50</b> into the spaces between the vertical pallet support members. Beneath each toe portion <b>50</b> a caster <b>52</b> is mounted. Adjacent to each toe portion <b>50</b> and inward of the distal ends of the prongs <b>34</b>, <b>48</b> a load roller <b>54</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a left-side prong mounting bracket <b>56</b> is fixed to the upper surface <b>58</b> of the left-side prong <b>36</b> and includes a U-shaped channel bracket portion <b>60</b> having a horizontal portion <b>62</b> that bears against and is free to slide along the upper edge <b>64</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b>. The vertical bracket portion <b>68</b> bears against the rear face <b>70</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b> (See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Similarly, a right-side prong mounting bracket <b>76</b> is fixed to the upper surface <b>78</b> of the right-side prong <b>38</b> and includes a U-shaped channel bracket portion <b>80</b> having a horizontal portion <b>82</b> that bears against and is free to slide along the upper edge <b>64</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b>. A vertical bracket portion <b>84</b> bears against the rear face <b>70</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b>. This arrangement allows the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to be moved farther apart or closer together while keeping them parallel to one another, lying in the same plane and having the ends of the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> aligned so that the ends define the corners of a rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distance between the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is determined and adjusted by a screw mechanism. A bearing housing <b>88</b> is fixed to the rear face <b>70</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b> in the middle of the length of the frame member <b>66</b>. A threaded rod <b>90</b>, having a smooth portion along its midpoint, is inserted into the bearing housing <b>88</b> and includes a left-hand end <b>92</b> extending outwardly to a left-hand end <b>94</b> of the frame member <b>66</b> and a right-hand end <b>96</b> extending outwardly to a right-hand end <b>98</b> of the frame member <b>66</b>. From the bearing housing <b>88</b> outwardly to the left-hand end <b>92</b>, the threaded rod <b>90</b> is threaded with left-handed threads and from the bearing housing <b>88</b> outwardly to the right-hand end <b>98</b> the threaded rod is threaded with right-handed threads so that when the crank handle <b>100</b> is turned clockwise from the point of view of a user standing facing it, the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are driven farther apart and when the crank handle <b>100</b> is turned counterclockwise, the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>28</b> are drawn closer together (for a larger view of the threaded rod and immediately associated fitting, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The left-hand portion of the threaded rod <b>90</b> is threaded into the left-side control nut <b>102</b> on the left-side prong mounting bracket <b>56</b> and a corresponding right-side control nut <b>104</b> is fixed to the right-side prong mounting bracket <b>76</b> and the right-hand portion of the threaded rod <b>90</b> is inserted into it. Both control nuts <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, one having a right-handed thread and the other a left-handed thread, are jammed together tightly to form a stop for preventing said left-side prong and said right-hand prong from being placed into an unstable relationship by being adjusted too close to each other. Alternatively the control number <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can be welded together. As a practical matter, any having the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> less than roughly one-third of the maximum width makes for an unstable pallet jack <b>10</b>. The maximum and maximum spacings between the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> depends on the overall scale of the pallet jack <b>10</b> and its intended uses. In a preferred embodiment, the full desirable spacing between the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is about 60-90 cm (24-36 inches) and the minimum allowable width, which can be user set, is about 30-340 cm (12-16 inches). The desired direction of rotation of the crank handle <b>100</b> needed to spread the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> apart or draw them together can be changed by, among other methods, changing the handedness of the threading on the threaded rod <b>90</b>. In this manner the distance between the left-side prong <b>36</b> and the right-side prong <b>38</b> is adjusted so that the pallet jack <b>10</b> can lift and transport pallets having different spacing between their vertical frame members.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the crank handle <b>100</b> is pivotally connected to a crank arm <b>106</b>, that is connected to an axle <b>108</b> having a large drive gear <b>110</b> fixed to it. A small drive gear <b>112</b> is fixed to the threaded rod <b>90</b> adjacent to the bearing housing <b>88</b> and these two gears are connected by a continuous loop drive chain <b>114</b>, which is preferably a bicycle-type chain, while an upper idler gear <b>116</b> and a lower idler gear <b>118</b> prevent the drive chain <b>114</b> from rubbing against any portion of the frame <b>12</b> and pinch the two sides of the loop formed by the drive chain <b>114</b> together keeping them close together and parallel to each other along a substantial length <b>120</b> of the drive chain <b>114</b>. The drive chain <b>114</b> preferably includes a keeper link to permit easy removal and repair or replacement of the drive chain <b>114</b> without disassembling the drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pair of jam nuts <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are tightly screwed together to serve as a stop that prevents the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>28</b> from being moved so close together that a pallet load may cause the pallet jack <b>10</b> to tip to one side or the other, that is, a certain minimum distance between the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>28</b> is required in order to provide a stable platform for moving loads on pallets. Because the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> move in rigid tandem fashion, a stop only needed on one side of threaded rod <b>90</b>. Other means for stopping inward movement of the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> can be provided, such as stopping the threading of the threaded rod <b>90</b> at an appropriate point adjacent to the bearing housing <b>88</b>, running a weld bead at the desired point, and so forth. On the outer ends of the threaded rod <b>90</b>, outward movement, that is, the spreading movement, of the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is stopped by a retainer clip <b>126</b> mounted in a retainer clip channel <b>128</b>, both seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or other suitable stop on each outer end of the threaded rod <b>90</b> to stop the left-side prong <b>36</b> and the right-hand prong <b>38</b> from running off of their respective ends of the threaded rod <b>90</b> at the outer spreading limit of the left-side prong <b>36</b> and the right-side prong <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, exploded away from the pallet jack <b>10</b> to reveal the drive mechanism is a housing cover <b>130</b> having a horizontal flange portion <b>132</b> that is fastened to the frame <b>12</b> through the apertures <b>134</b>. A vertical chain cover portion <b>136</b> is connected to the horizontal flange portion <b>132</b>, which covers the threaded rod <b>90</b> and related hardware and which is fastened to the frame <b>12</b> using the standoffs <b>138</b>. A vertically oriented chain drive housing portion <b>140</b> covers the chain drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame <b>12</b> includes a horizontally oriented base plate <b>142</b> with a left-side gusset plate <b>144</b> fixed to the base plate <b>142</b> and angled upwardly and inwardly and a right-side gusset plate <b>146</b> fixed to the base plate <b>142</b> and angled upwardly and inwardly and a rear plate <b>148</b>, which is in the shape of a triangle truncated at its top and leaning toward the operator from the bottom to the top of the rear plate <b>148</b>. Each of these plates is typically steel and they are typically fastened together by welding.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a truck frame <b>150</b> includes a left-side truck arm <b>152</b> and a right-side truck arm <b>154</b> extending toward the operator forming a yoke connected to the hydraulic bottle jack frame cap <b>32</b>, with the distal ends of the truck arms <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> both pivotally connected to the frame <b>12</b> and their proximal ends pivotally connected to the frame cap <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a compression coil spring <b>156</b> is disposed between a flange portion of a jack supporting plate <b>158</b> and the bottom end of the handle <b>16</b> to urge the handle <b>16</b> upward after it has been pulled downward by the operator to actuate the hydraulic bottle jack <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, on the top of each of the left-side prong mounting bracket <b>56</b> and the right-side prong mounting bracket <b>76</b> is a zerk grease fitting <b>159</b> for lubricating the mounting brackets <b>56</b>, <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the left-side prong mounting bracket <b>56</b> further includes an upstanding foot plate <b>160</b> that prevents the prongs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> from being pushed too far into a pallet, thereby locating the pallet on the left-side prong <b>36</b> and on the right-hand prong <b>36</b>, and an upstanding left-side triangular reinforcing gusset member <b>162</b> and a spaced corresponding right-side triangular reinforcing gusset member <b>164</b>. A reinforcing plate member <b>166</b> is fixed to the front face <b>74</b> of the prong supporting and carrying frame member <b>66</b>. The lower idler gear <b>118</b> is fastened to an axle mounted on the bracket <b>168</b>, which is fixed to the rear plate <b>148</b>. The left-side prong <b>36</b> moves inwardly as shown in phantom and along the direction of the directional arrow <b>170</b>, with the right-hand prong <b>38</b> moving inwardly by the same amount and then outwardly when the direction of rotation of the crank handle <b>100</b> is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a primary axle <b>172</b> is inserted through aligned axle fittings <b>174</b> in each of the right-side and left-side frame members <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, respectively, and though a yoke sleeve <b>176</b> of the truck yoke and is held in place by a separate retaining clip <b>177</b> at each end. The truck <b>14</b> includes two parallel spaced wheels <b>178</b>, <b>180</b>, which are mounted close together on the truck axle <b>181</b> to provide a small turning radius while providing stability for the pallet jack <b>10</b>. The vertical chain cover portion <b>140</b> of the drive mechanism housing cover <b>130</b> includes a right-side panel <b>182</b>, a left-hand side panel <b>184</b> and a central panel <b>186</b> all fastened together to from the vertical chain cover portion <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The threaded rod <b>90</b> is connected to the left-side prong mounting bracket <b>56</b> by the flat bracket plate <b>188</b>, which carries the left-side control nut <b>102</b> left-side and to the right-side prong mounting bracket <b>76</b> by the identical flat bracket plate <b>190</b>, which carries the right-side control nut <b>104</b>. The flat bracket plates <b>188</b>, <b>190</b> are attached to the left-side and right-side prong mounting brackets <b>56</b>, <b>76</b> respectively by the screws <b>192</b>.</p>
