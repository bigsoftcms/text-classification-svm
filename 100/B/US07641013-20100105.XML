<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on, and claims priority from, Korean Patent Application Serial Number 10-2006-0094671 filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Sep. 28, 2006, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a battery mounting structure for a hybrid vehicle, and more particularly, to a battery mounting structure that can easily mount a battery package in a vehicle and easily change the position of the battery package between a vertical position and a horizontal position.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles, including hybrid vehicles, are provided with batteries to supply electricity to motors for operating the vehicles. Generally, batteries are relatively large and heavy. Depending on the structure for mounting a battery in a vehicle, space utilization of vehicles, and convenience and safety of vehicle users, and so on can vary.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To date, two types of battery mounting structures have been developed: vertical type and horizontal type. In a vertical type battery mounting structure, a battery and an inverter are manufactured as an integrated package and the package is mounted to the rear surface of a rear seat of a vehicle in the direction parallel with the rear seat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the vertical structure, a relatively large space is obtained behind the rear seat, and the space can be used as a trunk space, thereby facilitating the process of placing or removing a spare tire into or from the trunk. Furthermore, the amount of space required to absorb impact caused in the event of a rear-end collision is increased, which enhances the safety of vehicle users.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in a horizontal type batter mounting structure, an integrated package comprising a battery and an inverter is horizontally oriented on the floor in the rear of a vehicle. Compared with the vertical structure, this horizontal structure is relatively easy to mount the integrated package in the vehicle. Additional advantage of this structure is that relatively long articles such as skis can be easily loaded into the vehicle after the rear seat has been folded down. However, due to the horizontal orientation of the battery mounting structure, the trunk space becomes smaller and the amount of space that can be deformed to absorb impact in the event of a rear-end collision may be insufficient. Also, it is inconvenient to place or remove a spare tire into or from the trunk.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is thus a need for an improved battery mounting structure that can easily mount a battery package in the vehicle, ensure sufficient trunk space to absorb impact in the event of a rear-end collision and to store a spare tire, and can load relatively long articles, such as skis, into the vehicle after a rear seat is folded down.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art that is already known to a person skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the present invention provides a batter mounting structure that can easily mount a battery structure in a vehicle and easily change the position of the battery package between a vertical position and a horizontal position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A battery mounting structure according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises a cylindrical shaft member, vertical position maintaining means, and horizontal position maintaining means. The cylindrical shaft member is provided in a rear edge of a lower end of a battery package which is adjacent to a rear end of the vehicle. The cylindrical shaft member serves as a rotating shaft for the battery package so that the battery package is rotatable around the cylindrical shaft member with respect to the vehicle body. Preferably, an electric wire of the battery package extends through the cylindrical shaft member outside the battery package. The vertical position maintaining means maintains the battery package in a vertically oriented state behind a rear seat of the vehicle. The horizontal position maintaining means maintains the battery package in a horizontally oriented state on an upper surface of a rear floor of the vehicle.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the drawings attached hereinafter, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below so as to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>. The cylindrical shaft member is integrally provided in a rear edge of a lower end of a battery package <b>1</b> which is adjacent to a rear end of a vehicle. It serves as a rotating shaft for the battery package <b>1</b> such that the battery package <b>1</b> is rotatable around the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b> with respect to the vehicle body. An electric wire for the battery package <b>1</b> extends outside through the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Such preferred embodiment of the present invention further comprises a vertical position maintaining means to maintain the battery package <b>1</b> in a vertically oriented state behind a rear seat of the vehicle, and a horizontal position maintaining means to maintain the battery package <b>1</b> in a horizontally oriented state on the upper surface of the rear portion of the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, the term &#x201c;battery package&#x201d; is recited herein to refer to not only a battery for operating a motor of a hybrid vehicle but also a battery package in which the battery is combined with an inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, the battery can be simply packaged alone or the battery and the inverter can be packaged together.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For reference, as shown in the drawings, the battery package <b>1</b> extends a predetermined length in a transverse direction of the vehicle body and is provided in a space defined between the rear seat and the trunk of the vehicle such that it is rotatable around the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>, which is oriented in a transverse direction of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the basis of the vertically oriented state of the battery package <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a surface <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> will be called an upper surface of the battery package <b>1</b>, surfaces <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> will be called opposite end surfaces of the battery package <b>1</b>, and a surface <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> will be called a rear surface of the battery package <b>1</b> which face the rear end of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Stop beads <b>5</b>, each of which has a predetermined cross-section and a predetermined length, are provided on a circumferential surface of the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>. A support member <b>9</b>, which has stop grooves <b>7</b> that receive the respective stop beads <b>5</b> therein, is provided in the vehicle body, so that the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b> is prevented from being undesirably moved in a longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, a separate bracket, which surrounds the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>, is mounted to the vehicle body, so that the battery package <b>1</b> can stably and smoothly rotate around the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b> between the vertical position and the horizontal position thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the battery package <b>1</b> is rotated between the vertical position and the horizontal position, the electric wire, which is connected to the battery package <b>1</b> through the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>, is not deformed, thus maintaining a stable electric connection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the vertical position maintaining means comprises a handle <b>11</b>, which is rotatably provided on the upper surface of the battery package <b>1</b>, a drive drum <b>13</b>, which is rotated by rotation of the handle <b>11</b>, and saw-toothed rotators <b>17</b>, which are coupled to the drive drum <b>13</b> through belts <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other words, when the handle <b>11</b> is rotated, the rotating force is transmitted to the saw-toothed rotators <b>17</b> through the drive drum <b>13</b> and the belts <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the battery package <b>1</b> is vertically oriented, if the vertical position locking bars <b>19</b> are advanced from the opposite end surfaces of the battery package <b>1</b> and inserted into respective holes, which are formed in the vehicle body at corresponding positions, the battery package <b>1</b> is securely fastened to the vehicle body by the vertical position locking bars <b>19</b> and the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, the horizontal position maintaining means comprises a catch <b>21</b>, which is provided on the rear surface of the battery package <b>1</b>, and a horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b>, which is designed to be linearly moved in a direction parallel to the rear floor so that the horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b> can be removably locked to the catch <b>21</b> while the battery package <b>1</b> is horizontally oriented on the upper surface of the rear floor. The horizontal position maintaining means further comprises a plate spring <b>25</b>, which is integrally coupled to the horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b> such that the locking bar <b>23</b> is biased in the direction in which the locking bar <b>23</b> is removed from the associated catch <b>21</b>, and a cam knob <b>27</b>, which has a vertical rotating shaft and is provided on the rear floor so as to be rotatable around the vertical rotating shaft, so that when the cam knob <b>27</b> is rotated in one direction, the locking bar <b>23</b> is moved in a direction in which the locking bar <b>23</b> is locked to the catch <b>21</b> while overcoming the elasticity of the plate spring <b>25</b>, thereby maintaining the battery package <b>1</b> in the horizontally oriented state. The horizontal position maintaining means further comprises a support body <b>29</b>, which is mounted to the rear floor to cover the locking bar <b>23</b>, the plate spring <b>25</b> and the cam knob <b>27</b> in a single body.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">That is, when a user rotates the cam knob <b>27</b> in one direction, the locking bar <b>23</b> is locked to or unlocked from the catch <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the user manipulates the handle <b>11</b> such that the vertical position locking bars <b>19</b> are retracted into the battery package <b>1</b> which has been oriented vertically, and rotates the battery package <b>1</b> around the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b> onto the upper surface of the rear floor, the catch <b>21</b> is inserted into the support body <b>29</b>. In this state, the user rotates the cam knob <b>27</b>. Thereby, the horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b> overcomes the elasticity of the plate spring <b>25</b> and can be advanced towards and locked to the catch <b>21</b>. Then, the battery package <b>1</b> is stably fastened to the vehicle body in a horizontally oriented state by the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>, the catch <b>21</b> and the horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> through <b>7</b>, the embodiment of the present invention may further comprise a horizontal position air supply means, which supplies air from a rear floor side into the battery package <b>1</b> through the rear surface of the battery package <b>1</b> while the battery package <b>1</b> is in a horizontally oriented state on the upper surface of the rear floor, a vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>, which is formed at an upper position in one end surface of the battery package <b>1</b> for the supply of air into the battery package <b>1</b> through one selected from the horizontal position air supply means and the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>, and an air outlet <b>33</b>, which is formed at a lower position in the other end surface of the battery package <b>1</b> to discharge air, which is drawn into the battery package <b>1</b> through the horizontal position air supply means or the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">That is, air is supplied into the battery package <b>1</b> through the horizontal position air supply means or the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>, and the supplied air is discharged outside through the air outlet <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The horizontal position air supply means comprises a horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b>, which is formed in the rear surface of the battery package <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the horizontal position air supply means further comprises an outer barrel <b>37</b>, which is provided through the rear floor at a position corresponding to the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b> when the battery package <b>1</b> is horizontally oriented on the upper surface of the rear floor, a drive cylinder <b>41</b>, which is rotatably placed in the outer barrel <b>37</b> and has drive flanges <b>39</b> on the upper and lower ends thereof, and an inner barrel <b>43</b>, which is placed in the drive cylinder <b>41</b> and is coupled at a position thereof to the outer barrel <b>37</b>. The horizontal position air supply means further comprises a flap valve <b>47</b>, a rotating shaft of which is supported by the inner barrel <b>43</b> and which has an integral roller <b>45</b> that is in rolling contact with one drive flange <b>39</b> of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, so that when the drive flange <b>39</b> is rotated, the flap valve <b>47</b> is rotated around the rotating shaft perpendicular to the rotating axis of the drive flange <b>39</b> to open or close the inner barrel <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, a connection cylinder <b>49</b>, which is designed to be linearly moved in a direction perpendicular to the rear floor, may be provided between the drive cylinder <b>41</b> and the inner barrel <b>43</b>. A guide protrusion <b>51</b> may suitably be provided on the circumferential inner surface of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>. A spiral guide slot <b>53</b> may preferably formed in the circumferential outer surface of the connection cylinder <b>49</b>. A linear guide slot <b>55</b> may also suitably be longitudinally formed in the connection cylinder <b>49</b> for placement of the rotating shaft of the flap valve <b>47</b> in the linear guide slot <b>55</b> of the connection cylinder <b>49</b>. Thus, when the drive cylinder <b>41</b> is rotated, the connection cylinder <b>49</b> is moved in a vertical direction by rotation of the guide protrusion <b>51</b> of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, which engages with the spiral guide slot <b>53</b> of the connection cylinder <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A filter <b>57</b> for filtering air passing through the inner barrel <b>43</b> may further be provided in the inner barrel <b>43</b>. In the embodiment of the present invention, two flap valves <b>47</b> are respectively provided above and below the filter <b>57</b> and are rotated by rotation of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vertical position air inlet <b>31</b> is used to supply air into the battery package <b>1</b>, which is in a vertically oriented state. At this time, the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b> is closed with a cap, as shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For reference, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>, the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b> and the air outlet <b>33</b> are illustrated as being closed with caps.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, a flexible air supply duct (not shown) is provided in the vehicle body and is removably coupled to the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>. The air outlet <b>33</b> is coupled to a flexible air discharge duct provided in the vehicle body, such that air is discharged outside the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Therefore, in case where the battery package <b>1</b> is vertically oriented, the air supply duct is coupled to the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b> for the supply of air into the battery package <b>1</b> through the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>. In case where the battery package <b>1</b> is horizontally oriented, the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b> is covered with the cap, and air is supplied into the battery package <b>1</b> by the horizontal position air supply means. In both cases, air supplied into the battery package <b>1</b> is discharged outside the vehicle through the air outlet <b>33</b> and the air discharge duct.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a detailed description of the operation of the horizontal position air supply means, when the user rotates the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, the rollers <b>45</b> of the flap valves <b>47</b>, which are in rolling contact with the drive flanges <b>39</b> of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, are rotated, so that the flap valves <b>47</b> are rotated, thereby opening the inner barrel <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, air can pass through the inner barrel <b>43</b> from the lower end thereof. Here, air is filtered while passing through the inner barrel <b>43</b> and is then supplied into the battery package <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, while the flap valves <b>47</b> are opened by rotation of the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, the guide protrusion <b>51</b>, which is rotated along with the drive cylinder <b>41</b>, guides the spiral guide slot <b>53</b> of the connection cylinder <b>49</b>, thus linearly moving the connection cylinder <b>49</b> upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hence, the connection cylinder <b>49</b> protrudes upwards from the rear floor. In this state, when the battery package <b>1</b> is placed in a horizontal position, the connection cylinder <b>49</b> is inserted into the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b>. Thus, air is supplied from the lower position of the vehicle body into the battery package <b>1</b> through the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b> after passing through the inner barrel <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above state, the battery package <b>1</b> can reliably maintain the horizontally oriented state using the horizontal position locking bar <b>23</b>, the catch <b>21</b>, and the cylindrical shaft member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When it is desired to stand the battery package <b>1</b> upright from the horizontally oriented state, the user rotates the cam knob <b>27</b>, such that the locking bar <b>23</b> is removed from the catch <b>21</b> by the elasticity of the plate spring <b>25</b>. Thereafter, the user places the battery package <b>1</b> upright and manipulates the handle <b>11</b> such that the battery package <b>1</b> is fastened to the vehicle body by the vertical position locking bars <b>19</b>. Subsequently, the air supply duct is coupled to the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b>, and the horizontal position air inlet <b>35</b> is covered with the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the drive cylinder <b>41</b> is rotated in a reverse direction, the connection cylinder <b>49</b> is moved downwards and, simultaneously, the flap valves <b>47</b> are returned to the closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> compares a vertically oriented state (left view) with a horizontally oriented state (right view) of the battery package installed in the vehicle body. In the vertically oriented state, air is supplied from the air supply duct (A) into the battery package <b>1</b> through the vertical position air inlet <b>31</b> and is discharged outside the vehicle body through the air outlet <b>33</b> and the air discharge duct (B), as shown by the arrow. On the other hand, in the horizontally oriented state, air is supplied into the battery package <b>1</b> through the horizontal position air supply means (C), circulates in the battery package <b>1</b>, and is discharged outside the vehicle body through the air discharge duct (B), as shown by the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The objectives of the present invention are achieved by the above-mentioned structures. In case where the battery package is vertically oriented, a relatively large space is defined behind the rear seat in the vehicle, the space can be used as a trunk space and the trunk space facilitates a process of placing or removing a spare tire into or from the trunk. Furthermore, because the amount of space that can be deformed to absorb impact in the event of a rear-end collision is increased, thereby enhancing the safety of vehicle users. In case where the battery package is horizontally placed, after the rear seat is folded, a relatively long article such as a pair of skis can be easily loaded into the vehicle. In addition, because it is not required to mount the battery package at an inclined angle of the rear seat of the vehicle, ease of assembly is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As is apparent from the foregoing, battery mounting structures of the present invention can easily mount a battery package in a vehicle and easily change the position of the battery package between a vertical and a horizontal positions. The present structures ensure a large trunk space enough to absorb impact when a rear collision occurs and to store a spare tire. Also, the present structures make it possible to load relatively long articles such as skis into the vehicle simply by folding down a rear seat.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The invention has been described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments thereof. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
