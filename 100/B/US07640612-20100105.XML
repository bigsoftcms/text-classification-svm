<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device incorporating a chamber through the interior of which, at least on occasion, there is a flow of liquid or of a gas at an elevated pressure when the device is in operation, wherein the device comprises at least one drawer and at least one drawer guide by means of which the drawer is held on a corpus of the chamber such that it is displaceable in the direction of movement of the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such devices are known from the state of the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, dishwashers are known which incorporate a rinsing chamber through the interior of which there is a flow of a rinsing liquid (water together with cleaning additives) at least on occasion when the device is in operation, wherein the dishwasher comprises at least one drawer in the form of a tableware basket for holding the articles which are to be cleaned. The drawer is withdrawable from the rinsing chamber and in so doing is guided on a pair of withdrawable guide rails by means of rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of these devices, it is a disadvantage that guiding the drawer on the extendable guide rails by means of the rollers is a cumbersome operation and not very precise, and the guide rails also tend to be pulled out from the interior of the rinsing chamber in an uneven manner, this thereby resulting in the drawer being slightly tilted as it is being withdrawn. Furthermore, in operation of the device, the dirt that is rinsed off the articles being cleaned is deposited on the running tracks of the guide rails where it is compacted by the rollers guiding the drawer, this thus impairing the running attributes of the rollers on the running tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, the object of the present invention is to produce a device of the type mentioned hereinabove which enables precise and smooth-running guidance of the drawer during movements thereof within the interior or when pulling it out of the interior or when pushing it into the interior of the chamber even after extended operation of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the invention, this object is achieved in that the drawer guide comprises at least one guide rail at the drawer side and one guide rail at the corpus (i.e., chamber) side and at least one rolling member assembly by means of which one of the guide rails is guided in displaceable manner on another guide rail of the drawer guide in the direction of movement of the drawer and which comprises a cage for the rolling members, wherein
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">at least one of the guide rails of the drawer guide comprises a rear rail portion which includes at least one partial section that extends in the direction of movement of the drawer and is provided with fluid passage openings in such a manner that the liquid or the gas is adapted to flow through the guide rail concerned when the device is in operation, and/or</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">at least one cage for the rolling members of the drawer guide comprises a rear cage portion which includes at least one partial section that extends in the direction of movement of the drawer and is provided with fluid passage openings in such a manner that the liquid or the gas is adapted to flow through the cage for the rolling members when the device is in operation.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Here, the rear rail portion of a guide rail is to be understood as being the web which connects the two running tracks for the rolling members of the guide rail. The rear cage portion of a cage for the rolling members is to be understood as being the web which connects the two rolling member retaining strips of the cage for the rolling members.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">In this description and in the accompanying claims, a &#x201c;drawer&#x201d; is to be understood as being any element which is movable within the chamber or out of the chamber or into the chamber by a relative displacement of the guide rails.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">In this description and in the accompanying claims, a &#x201c;drawer guide&#x201d; is to be understood as being any device with which at least two guide rails are held such as to be displaceable relative to one another; it is irrelevant here as to whether one of the guide rails is pulled out of the other one or not.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">The direction of movement of the drawer can, in principle, be arbitrarily aligned, in particular, substantially horizontally or substantially vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">The gas at an elevated pressure can be any gas or gas mixture which is subjected to a pressure that is higher relative to the ambient pressure, for example, the air in a compressed-air jet.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Thus, the concept underlying the solution in accordance with the invention is the use of a drawer guide incorporating guide rails mounted on rolling members for guiding the drawer, such a drawer guide enabling particularly precise and smooth-running guidance of the drawer during the movement thereof within the interior of the chamber or when pulling it out of the interior or when pushing it into the interior of the chamber of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Due to the fluid passage openings provided in the rear rail portions of the guide rails and/or in the rear cage portions of the cage for the rolling members, through which said openings the liquid or the gas flowing through the chamber can enter the drawer guide and then depart from the drawer guide, it is thereby ensured that the drawer guide, and in particular, the running tracks thereof for the rolling members, will not be subjected to deposits of dirt particles and thus become unusable, but rather, that they will be flushed through by this liquid or the gas with as little hindrance as possible and, to a large extent, be kept free of dirt deposits by virtue of this flushing action.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">This concept underlying the invention is very surprising since it would seem much more obvious to prevent contamination of the running tracks of the drawer guide by shielding the interior of the drawer guide to as large an extent as possible from the penetration of liquid or gas from the interior of the chamber in order to thereby prevent the ingress of the dirt particles which are rinsed off the articles being cleaned in the interior of the chamber by the liquid or the gas. Unexpectedly however, it has now been established that the penetration of liquid or gas into the drawer guide, even if the liquid or gas is loaded with dirt particles, is not harmful to the normal functioning of the drawer guide, as long as it is ensured that the liquid or the gas together with the dirt particles carried therein can stream out of the drawer guide again with as little hindrance as possible. In this way, dirt particles are prevented from collecting in the drawer guide, and in particular, on the bearing surfaces of the rolling members, which action could impair the normal functioning of the drawer guide.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">In the device in accordance with the invention, provision is made for at least one of the guide rails and/or at least one cage for the rolling members to be provided with the fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">A particularly good volume of flow through the drawer guide is achieved if all the guide rails of the drawer guide and/or all the cages for the rolling members of the drawer guide are provided with such fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">It is particularly expedient if all of the guide rails and also all of the cages for the rolling members of the drawer guide are provided with such fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Insofar as further add-on elements are present in addition to the guide rails and the cages for the rolling members, then these should also be designed such as to be as through-flow-friendly as possible in order to present as little impedance as possible to the flow of fluid or the flow of gas through the drawer guide, or even if they were to assist this process, this being possible, in particular, if a fluid jet or a compressed gas jet that is produced in the interior of the chamber of the device is deliberately directed towards the fluid passage openings in the drawer guide by appropriate design of the add-on elements.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Experiments with dishwashers have confirmed that for the efficient washing of residual substances and in particular dirt particles out of the drawer guide, it is expedient if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the guide rail to the total surface area of the rear rail portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at least approximately 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">If the fluid passage openings are provided in the rear cage portion of a cage for the rolling members, then it has proved to be expedient if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the cage for the rolling members to the total surface area of the rear cage portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at least approximately 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">The cleaning efficiency of the liquid or of the gas passing through the drawer guide becomes greater with increasing throughput of liquid and/or increasing throughput of gas through the drawer guide.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Consequently, it is particularly expedient if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the guide rail to the total surface area of the rear rail portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at least approximately 25%, preferably to at least approximately 30%, and especially to at least approximately 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">As an alternative or in addition thereto, it is particularly expedient if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the cage for the rolling members to the total surface area of the rear cage portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at least approximately 25%, preferably to at least approximately 30%, and especially to at least approximately 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">On the other hand, the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings to the total surface area of the rear rail portion or to that of the rear cage portion should not be too large so as to ensure adequate mechanical stability of the drawer guide.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The upper limit for the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings consistent with maintaining adequate mechanical stability of the drawer guide depends, in particular, upon the geometry of the guide rail profiles, on the materials used, on the loading, on the relationship between the overall length and the length of withdrawal of the drawer guide and on the linkage between the drawer guide and the environment, i.e. in particular, on the type of attachment of the drawer guide to the boundary walls of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">In order to obtain adequate mechanical stability of the drawer guide, it has proved to be expedient if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the guide rail to the total surface area of the rear rail portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at most approximately 90%, and preferably to at most approximately 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">As an alternative or in addition thereto, it is of advantage if the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the cage for the rolling members to the total surface area of the rear cage portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) in the partial section that is provided with the fluid passage openings amounts to at most approximately 90%, and preferably to at most approximately 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">In particular, a framework structure can be introduced into the rear rail portion and/or into the rear cage portion which will be such as to permit optimal flushing characteristics under the given mechanical boundary conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">The fluid passage openings can, in principle, be produced using any arbitrary procedure which allows the material of the passage openings to be separated away from the surrounding material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">In particular, provision may be made for the fluid passage openings to be inserted into the rear rail portion or the rear cage portion by a punching process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">However, in order to enable particularly high aperture ratios to be obtained without giving rise to distortions in the guide rail or in the cage for the rolling members, it is expedient for the fluid passage openings to be produced in the guide rail or in the cage for the rolling members by means of a force-free separation process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In particular, provision may be made for the fluid passage openings to be inserted into the guide rail or into the cage for the rolling members by means of a laser cutting process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">By virtue of such a laser cutting process, ratios falling within the range of approximately 80% to approximately 90% for the surface areas of the fluid passage openings are easily attainable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Instead of forming the fluid passage openings in the rear rail portion or in the rear cage portion by a removal process, provision could also be made for the rear rail portion or the rear cage portion to be formed with the desired fluid passage openings from the very beginning, for example, by means of a casting process (in particular a synthetic material injection moulding process), or by assembling the rear rail portion or the rear cage portion from a plurality of components in such a way that gaps formed between the assembled components result in the desired fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">In order to obtain as high a throughput of liquid or as high a throughput of gas as possible through the drawer guide, it is of advantage if at least one of the partial sections provided with fluid passage openings extends over at least one third of the length of the rear rail portion or over at least one third of the length of the rear cage portion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Furthermore, it is expedient if the sum of the lengths of the partial sections of the rear rail portion or those of the rear cage portion that are provided with fluid passage openings is greater than approximately two thirds of the total length of the rear rail portion or the rear cage portion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">It is particularly expedient if the entire rear rail portion or the entire rear cage portion forms just a single partial section provided with fluid passage openings, in which the previously mentioned ratios of the surface areas of the fluid passage openings are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Thus, in this case, the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the guide rail to the total surface area of the rear rail portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) amounts to at least approximately 20%, preferably to at least approximately 25%, especially to at least approximately 30%, and most especially to at least approximately 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">In this case, as an alternative or in addition thereto, the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings in the cage for the rolling members to the total surface area of the rear cage portion (including the surface area of the fluid passage openings) amounts to at least approximately 20%, preferably to at least approximately 25%, especially to at least approximately 30%, and most especially to at least approximately 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">Basically, it is of advantage if the fluid passage openings extend as closely as possible to the running tracks for the rolling members of the guide rails so that, on the one hand, there will be as low a loss of flow power within the drawer guide as possible, whence the fluid jet or the compressed gas jet will hit the residues that are to be cleared away with as high an energy as possible and thus rinse them away, and so that, on the other hand, no dead water zones will develop within the running tracks for the rolling members wherein liquid residues or rinsing residues can collect.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">Consequently, it is of advantage if at least one partial section of a guide rail of the drawer guide comprises fluid passage openings whose lateral distance from at least one of the lateral edges of the rear rail portion of the guide rail concerned is less than approximately a quarter of the width of the rear rail portion.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The drawer guides may be built into the chamber such as to be standing (i.e. with vertically aligned rear rail portions) as well as lying (i.e. with horizontally aligned rear rail portions). The optimal situation in the installation depends on the selected dimensions of the rails, on the materials employed and on the loads imposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">If the drawer guide is built-in such as to be standing, then this is particularly expedient for the run-off of the liquid from the drawer guide if at least one partial section of a guide rail of the drawer guide comprises fluid passage openings having a lower edge whose distance from a lower edge of the rear rail portion of the guide rail concerned is less than approximately a quarter of the width of the rear rail portion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">Here, the width of the rear rail portion is to be understood as being the extent of the rear rail portion in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">In the case of a preferred embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention, provision is made for the respective partial section of the rear rail portion or of the rear cage portion that is provided with the fluid passage openings to comprise at least three substantially mutually congruent fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Since, in the case of preferred embodiments of the device in accordance with the invention, the drawer guide comprises a plurality of elements (guide rails and cages for the rolling members) which are displaceable relative to one another and are each provided with fluid passage openings whereby the fluid passage openings in the different elements are aligned with one another in certain positions of the drawer guide whilst they are displaced relative to one another in other positions of the drawer guide, then, in principle, there is a danger that operating personnel, and in particular children, will insert one or more fingers into the mutually aligned fluid passage openings and that the finger or the fingers will be crushed in the course of a subsequent relative displacement of the elements of the drawer guide.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">In order to obviate this danger, it is of advantage if the extent of each one of the fluid passage openings in the rear rail portion or in the rear cage portion of the drawer guide is at most approximately 5 mm in at least one of the directions in which it extends. Such fluid passage openings would then be too small for one let alone a plurality of fingers to be stuck into the mutually aligned fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">It has proved to be particularly expedient if the extent of each of the fluid passage openings in the rear rail portion or in the rear cage portion is at most approximately 5 mm in the direction of movement of the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">In order to obstruct the flow of the liquid or the gas through the drawer guide as little as possible, provision is made in a preferred embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention for at least one guide rail of the drawer guide and at least one cage for the rolling members of the same drawer guide to be provided with fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In order to ensure perfect flushing of the drawer guide, it has proved to be particularly expedient if, in a state of the drawer guide in which it is pushed completely into the interior of the chamber, at least one fluid passage opening in the guide rail and at least one fluid passage opening in the cage for the rolling members are aligned with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Here, &#x201c;alignment&#x201d; of two adjacent fluid passage openings in different elements of the drawer guide is to be understood as being any situation, in which the fluid passage opening in the one element substantially completely covers the pertinent fluid passage opening in the other element (as seen in a direction running perpendicularly relative to the direction of movement of the drawer). For the purposes of &#x201c;alignment&#x201d; in this sense, it is not necessary for the boundary lines of the two fluid passage openings that are associated with one another to coincide with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">For perfect flushing of the drawer guide it is expedient, if, in a state of the drawer guide in which it is pushed completely into the interior of the chamber, a plurality of fluid passage openings in the guide rail are aligned with a respective fluid passage opening in the cage for the rolling members.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">It is particularly expedient, if, in a state of the drawer guide in which it is pushed completely into the interior of the chamber, substantially all of the fluid passage openings in the guide rail are aligned with a respective fluid passage opening in the cage for the rolling members.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In order to produce turbulences in the flowing liquid or the gas which are effective to dislodge dirt particles in the drawer guide, it can also be of advantage if, in the state of complete insertion into the interior of the chamber, the edges of the fluid passage openings of neighbouring elements of the drawer guide (guide rails or cages for the rolling members) are mutually displaced in the direction of movement of the drawer in such a manner that a respective one of the elements partly, but not completely, covers the fluid passage openings in the other respective element. In this way, the effect is achieved that the liquid or the gas can enter each region of the drawer guide and that obstacles are formed in the path of the liquid or the gas by the displaced edges, thereby producing the desired turbulences.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">In order to enable the residual liquid to run off the rolling member running track of a guide rail in the drawer guide, it is of advantage if at least one guide rail of the drawer guide comprises a running track for the rolling members which is provided with at least one fluid passage opening.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Since the presence of such fluid passage openings in the rolling member running track could have negative effects on the running attributes of the rolling members in the rolling member running track, it is expedient if the rolling member running track is provided with one or with a plurality of fluid passage openings in only one end region or in both end regions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">A certain latching effect for the rolling members in the maximally withdrawn position of the drawer guide can also be obtained by virtue of the fluid passage openings provided in an end region of the rolling member running track.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">In the case of a preferred embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention, provision is made for at least one rolling member assembly of the drawer guide to comprise rolling members in the form of balls or in the form of spherical rollers which only touch the rolling member running track along a line.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">It is particularly expedient, if at least one rolling member assembly of the drawer guide comprises rolling members which are each in single-point contact with a rolling member running track of a guide rail of the drawer guide associated with the rolling members. By virtue of such a single-point contact of the rolling member with the associated rolling member running track, there thus ensues a snow plough effect, i.e. the rolling member furrows through possibly existing deposits on the rolling member running track and displaces dirt that may possibly have accumulated on the rolling member running track to the side away from the rolling member running track. A self cleaning effect of the rolling member running track is obtained in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">As an alternative to the rolling members resting on the rolling member running track in single-point manner, provision could also be made for the rolling members to rest on the rolling member running track at two positions which are spaced from one another in a direction transverse to the direction of movement of the drawer. In this case in particular, the region of the rolling member running track lying between the contact positions can be provided with fluid passage openings so that dirt can be washed off the rolling member running track through these fluid passage openings.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The drawer guide of the device in accordance with the invention may be in the form of a two-piece partial drawer guide, i.e. comprise only the guide rail at the drawer side and the guide rail at the corpus side.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">However, provision may also be made for the drawer guide to be formed of at least three parts and thus for it to comprise at least one further guide rail in addition to the guide rail at the drawer side and the guide rail at the corpus side, said further guide rail being arranged between the drawer side guide rail and the corpus side guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Such a drawer guide may, for example, be in the form of a multiple drawer guide arrangement (two coupled partial drawer guides) or in the form of a telescopic drawer guide arrangement (having a guide rail at the corpus side, a middle guide rail that is displaceable relative thereto and a drawer-side guide rail that is displaceable in the middle guide rail).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">In order to make the drawer located in the interior of the chamber as easily accessible as possible for the purposes of loading or unloading it, it is of advantage if the drawer guide is in the form of a full withdrawl guide with the aid of which the drawer is withdrawable substantially completely from the interior of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">In particular, the device in accordance with the invention may be in the form of a dishwasher or a washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">In principle however, other embodiments of the device in accordance with the invention also come into consideration, for example, in the form of a disinfecting device, a sterilizing device, flow equipment or the like, i.e. any of those devices which comprise a chamber through which there is at least an occasional flow of liquid during the operation of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">One embodiment is directed toward the use of a drawer guide which comprises at least one guide rail at the drawer side and one guide rail at the corpus side and at least one rolling member assembly by means of which the drawer side guide rail is guided in displaceable manner on the corpus side guide rail or on another guide rail of the drawer guide in the direction of movement of the drawer and which comprises a cage for the rolling members, wherein

        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0071">at least one cage for the rolling members of the drawer guide comprises a rear cage portion which includes at least one partial section that extends in the direction of movement of the drawer and is provided with fluid passage openings in such a manner that a liquid or a gas is adapted to flow through the cage for the rolling members,
<br/>
for the purposes of holding a drawer in displaceable manner on a corpus of a chamber in a device through the interior of which, at least on occasion, there is a flow of liquid or of a gas at an elevated pressure when the device is in operation.

<p id="p-0084" num="0087">Similar or functionally equivalent elements are designated by the same reference symbols in each of the Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">A device in the form of a dishwasher for example, and bearing the general reference <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and it comprises a chamber <b>102</b> having an interior <b>104</b> which is bounded by a corpus <b>106</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> and through which a liquid, for example water together with detergent additives, is adapted to flow at least occasionally when the device is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The corpus <b>106</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>108</b> from which two parallel, vertical side walls <b>110</b> and also a vertical rear wall <b>112</b> that connects the side walls <b>110</b> together extend upwardly, as well as an upper wall <b>114</b> that delimits the interior <b>104</b>, said corpus being adapted to be closed at its open front side in fluid-tight manner by means of a front flap <b>118</b> that is pivotal about a horizontal axis <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">The interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> accommodates one or more, two for example, drawers <b>120</b> which are in the form of table-ware baskets for example.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">As an alternative thereto, the drawers <b>120</b> could, for example, be in the form of vessels, bowls, trays, holding devices or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">Each of the drawers <b>120</b> is held on the two side walls <b>110</b> by means of a respective drawer guide <b>122</b> in such a manner that (when the front flap <b>118</b> is open) it is adapted to be pulled out from the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> in a substantially horizontal drawer-withdrawal direction <b>124</b> or pushed completely into the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> in a direction opposite to the drawer-withdrawal direction <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">The drawer guides <b>122</b> are full withdrawal guides which permit the respectively associated drawer <b>120</b> to be substantially completely pulled out from the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality, two for example, of spraying devices <b>126</b> are arranged in the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>, each of said spraying devices comprising one or more spraying arms <b>130</b> that rotate about a vertical axis of rotation <b>128</b> for example and are each provided with a plurality of spray nozzles <b>132</b> which are arranged on the upper surface and/or on the lower surface of the respective spraying arm <b>130</b> and with the aid of which a liquid is adapted to be sprayed into the space above or below the respective spraying device <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">In the case of a dishwasher, this liquid is the rinsing liquid which may comprise, in particular, water together with rinsing additives.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">The liquid that is sprayed when the device <b>100</b> is in operation is indicated by the broken lines <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">The sprayed liquid <b>134</b> flows through the drawers <b>120</b>, which, for example, are in the form of latticework baskets having the articles contained therein for cleaning purposes for example, and possibly through the drawer guides <b>122</b>, it then collects on the floor of the chamber <b>102</b> and flows out from the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> through a (not illustrated) discharge opening.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">In particular, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first spraying device <b>126</b> can be arranged between the bottom wall <b>108</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> and a lower drawer <b>120</b>, whilst a further spraying device <b>126</b> can be arranged between two drawers <b>120</b>, in particular, near the lower surface of an upper drawer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">In order to enable the streams of fluid emerging from the spray nozzles <b>132</b> to enter the drawer guides <b>122</b> as unhindered as possible and to enable the liquid entering the drawer guide <b>122</b> to loosen the residues, in particular the dirt particles, that are deposited on the drawer guides <b>122</b> and wash them out from the drawer guides <b>122</b>, and indeed, with as small a loss of flow power as possible, the guide rails <b>136</b> of the drawer guides <b>122</b>, which are guided upon one another in displaceable manner in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> by means of rolling member assemblies <b>138</b>, are each provided with a plurality of liquid passage openings <b>140</b> which succeed one another in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> and enable the liquid to enter the drawer guide <b>122</b> and also enable the liquid (and the dirt particles contained therein) to flow out from the drawer guide <b>122</b>, as is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">A drawer guide <b>122</b> comprising two guide rails <b>136</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the withdrawn state.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drawer guide <b>122</b> is illustrated in the fully pushed-in state after the device <b>100</b> has been set in operation. In this state, the drawer guide <b>122</b> is flushed by the liquid being sprayed in the interior <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>, the directions of flow of this liquid being schematically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by means of the arrows <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">In order to present as little obstruction to the entry and exit of the liquid as possible, the guide rails <b>136</b> are preferably formed in such a way that, in the completely pushed-in state of the drawer guide <b>122</b>, their fluid passage openings <b>140</b> are aligned with one another and with the fluid passage openings in a cage for the rolling members which is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">A concrete example of a drawer guide <b>122</b> comprising three guide rails, which is particularly suitable for use in a chamber <b>102</b> through which liquid flows, is illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">This drawer guide <b>122</b> comprises a guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>at the corpus side (see, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a guide rail <b>136</b><i>c </i>at the drawer side (see, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and a middle guide rail <b>136</b><i>b </i>which is arranged between the corpus-side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the drawer-side guide rail <b>136</b><i>c </i>(see, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">As can best be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the middle guide rail <b>136</b><i>b </i>is guided in displaceable manner on the corpus-side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> by means of a first rolling member assembly <b>138</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">The drawer side guide rail <b>136</b><i>c </i>is guided in displaceable manner on the middle guide rail <b>136</b><i>b </i>in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> by means of a second rolling member assembly <b>138</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">The corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>is illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">It comprises a rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>having a flat external surface <b>146</b> with the aid of which the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>rests flatly against one of the side walls <b>110</b> of the corpus <b>106</b> in the installed state.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">A respective running track <b>148</b><i>a </i>for the rolling members extends away from the lower edge and from the upper edge of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a</i>, said running track being concavely curved (as seen from the longitudinal centre plane <b>149</b> of the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a</i>) in order to provide a contact surface and lateral guidance for the rolling members <b>150</b> of the first rolling member assembly <b>138</b><i>a </i>which are in the form of balls.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>is provided with various mounting holes <b>152</b> which serve for mounting the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a</i>, in particular, by the passage of mounting means (screws for example) through the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">Moreover, the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>is provided with a stop member <b>153</b> which cooperates with a cage <b>166</b><i>a </i>for the rolling members in the first rolling member assembly <b>138</b><i>a </i>in order to limit the displacement path of the first rolling member assembly <b>138</b><i>a </i>relative to the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">Furthermore, in a first partial section <b>154</b><i>a </i>which extends in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> over approximately a third of the length of the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a</i>, and also in a second partial section <b>154</b><i>b </i>which likewise extends in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> over approximately a third of the length of the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a</i>, the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>of the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>is provided with a plurality of fluid passage openings <b>140</b> which serve for the entry and exit of liquid through the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>when the device <b>100</b> is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">The fluid passage openings <b>140</b> in the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a </i>are formed in such a manner that they are all substantially congruent to one another, follow one another in sequence in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> and are spaced from one another in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114">Each of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b> is substantially rectangular with rounded-off corner regions.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">In a concrete exemplary embodiment, the extent <b>1</b> of each of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b> in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> amounts to approximately 5 mm, whilst the extent b of each of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b> in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b> amounts to approximately 16 mm. The total width B of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>amounts to approximately 28 mm, and the width L of the web <b>156</b> between two successive fluid passage openings <b>140</b>, i.e. the extent thereof in the direction of movement of the drawer <b>124</b>, amounts to approximately 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">It ensues therefrom that the ratio of the surface area of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b> to the total surface area of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>(including the surface areas of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b>) in the two partial sections <b>154</b><i>a</i>, <b>154</b><i>b </i>amounts to approximately 29% in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0117">The distance d of the lower edge of each fluid passage opening <b>140</b> from the lower edge of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>or of the upper edge of each of the fluid passage openings <b>140</b> from the upper edge of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a </i>amounts to approximately 5 mm, i.e. approximately 18% of the width B of the rear rail portion <b>144</b><i>a. </i></p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0151">Due to this single-point contact of the rolling members <b>150</b> on the running tracks for the rolling members, there ensues a snow plough effect, i.e. each rolling member <b>150</b> furrows through possibly existing deposits on the rolling member running tracks and displaces these deposits to the side away from the rolling member running track concerned. An adverse effect upon the running attributes of the rolling member assemblies <b>138</b><i>a</i>, <b>138</b><i>b </i>due to possible dirt deposits on the drawer guides <b>122</b> is prevented in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0152">The fluid passage openings <b>140</b>, <b>164</b> in the guide rails or in the cage for the rolling members can be produced by any suitable separation process, in particular, by punching them out or by means of a laser cutting process.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0153">In the case of a variant of the previously described drawer guide <b>122</b> for use in the device <b>100</b>, provision may be made for the respective end regions <b>175</b> of the rolling member running tracks <b>148</b><i>a</i>, <b>148</b><i>b</i>, <b>148</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; and/or <b>148</b><i>c </i>to be provided with one or with a plurality of fluid passage openings <b>176</b> which enable residual liquid to drain off the respective rolling member running track.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0154">Moreover, these passage openings in the end region of a rolling member running track may serve to provide a certain latching effect for one or more rolling members <b>150</b> in a withdrawn position of the drawer guide <b>122</b>. For this purpose, the fluid passage openings <b>176</b> in the end region <b>175</b> of the rolling member running track concerned are substantially circular in shape, and they are arranged at a distance D from one another which corresponds to the spacing between two rolling members <b>150</b> in one of the cages <b>166</b><i>a</i>, <b>166</b><i>b </i>for the rolling members.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0155">A plan view of such an end region <b>175</b> incorporating fluid passage openings <b>176</b> is illustrated in exemplary manner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> on the basis of the rolling member running track <b>148</b><i>a </i>of the corpus side guide rail <b>136</b><i>a. </i></p>
