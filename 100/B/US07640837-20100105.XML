<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to table saws and more particularly to a table saw with an improved safety system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Table saws are a type of woodworking machinery used to cut workpieces of wood, plastic and other materials. Table saws include a flat surface or table with a circular saw blade extending up through a slot in the table. A user slides a workpiece on the table against and past the blade while the blade is spinning to cut the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Of all the tools in a wood working shop, table saws present perhaps the greatest risk of injury. Table saws present a risk of injury to users because the spinning blade is often exposed when in use. The blade cuts very quickly and can sever a finger upon the slightest slip or misplacement. Accordingly, safety features or systems have been developed to minimize the risk of injury. Probably the most common safety feature is a blade guard that physically blocks a user from making contact with the spinning blade. In many cases, blade guards effectively reduce the risk of injury, however, there are many instances where the nature of the operations to be performed precludes using a guard that completely blocks access to the blade. There exists a need for a table saw with a safety system that significantly reduces the risk of serious injury from a user accidentally contacting the spinning blade.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Machine <b>10</b> may be any of a variety of different table saws. Machine <b>10</b> includes an operative structure <b>12</b> having a cutting tool <b>14</b> and a motor assembly <b>16</b> adapted to drive the cutting tool. Machine <b>10</b> also includes a safety system <b>18</b> configured to minimize the potential of a serious injury to a person using machine <b>10</b>. Safety system <b>18</b> is adapted to detect the occurrence of one or more dangerous conditions during use of machine <b>10</b>. If such a dangerous condition is detected, safety system <b>18</b> is adapted to engage operative structure <b>12</b> to limit any injury to the user caused by the dangerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Machine <b>10</b> also includes a suitable power source <b>20</b> to provide power to operative structure <b>12</b> and safety system <b>18</b>. Power source <b>20</b> may be an external power source such as line current, or an internal power source such as a battery. Alternatively, power source <b>20</b> may include a combination of both external and internal power sources. Furthermore, power source <b>20</b> may include two or more separate power sources, each adapted to power different portions of machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It will be appreciated that operative structure <b>12</b> may take any one of many different forms, depending on the type of machine <b>10</b>. For example, operative structure <b>12</b> may include a stationary housing configured to support motor assembly <b>16</b> in driving engagement with cutting tool <b>14</b>. Alternatively, operative structure <b>12</b> may include a movable structure configured to carry cutting tool <b>14</b> between multiple operating positions. As a further alternative, operative structure <b>12</b> may include one or more transport mechanisms adapted to convey a workpiece toward and/or away from cutting tool <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Motor assembly <b>16</b> includes one or more motors adapted to drive cutting tool <b>14</b>. The motors may be either directly or indirectly coupled to the cutting tool, and may also be adapted to drive workpiece transport mechanisms. Cutting tool <b>14</b> typically includes one or more blades or other suitable cutting implements that are adapted to cut or remove portions from the workpieces. The particular form of cutting tool <b>14</b> will vary depending upon the various embodiments of machine <b>10</b>. For example, in table saws, miter saws, circular saws and radial arm saws, cutting tool <b>14</b> will typically include one or more circular rotating blades having a plurality of teeth disposed along the perimetrical edge of the blade. For a jointer or planer, the cutting tool typically includes a plurality of radially spaced-apart blades. For a band saw, the cutting tool includes an elongate, circuitous tooth-edged band.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Safety system <b>18</b> includes a detection subsystem <b>22</b>, a reaction subsystem <b>24</b> and a control subsystem <b>26</b>. Control subsystem <b>26</b> may be adapted to receive inputs from a variety of sources including detection subsystem <b>22</b>, reaction subsystem <b>24</b>, operative structure <b>12</b> and motor assembly <b>16</b>. The control subsystem may also include one or more sensors adapted to monitor selected parameters of machine <b>10</b>. In addition, control subsystem <b>26</b> typically includes one or more instruments operable by a user to control the machine. The control subsystem is configured to control machine <b>10</b> in response to the inputs it receives.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Detection subsystem <b>22</b> is configured to detect one or more dangerous, or triggering, conditions during use of machine <b>10</b>. For example, the detection subsystem may be configured to detect that a portion of the user's body is dangerously close to, or in contact with, a portion of cutting tool <b>14</b>. As another example, the detection subsystem may be configured to detect the rapid movement of a workpiece due to kickback by the cutting tool, as is described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/182,866, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, detection subsystem <b>22</b> may inform control subsystem <b>26</b> of the dangerous condition, which then activates reaction subsystem <b>24</b>. In other embodiments, the detection subsystem may be adapted to activate the reaction subsystem directly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Once activated in response to a dangerous condition, reaction subsystem <b>24</b> is configured to engage operative structure <b>12</b> quickly to prevent serious injury to the user. It will be appreciated that the particular action to be taken by reaction subsystem <b>24</b> will vary depending on the type of machine <b>10</b> and/or the dangerous condition that is detected. For example, reaction subsystem <b>24</b> may be configured to do one or more of the following: stop the movement of cutting tool <b>14</b>, disconnect motor assembly <b>16</b> from power source <b>20</b>, place a barrier between the cutting tool and the user, or retract the cutting tool from its operating position, etc. The reaction subsystem may be configured to take a combination of steps to protect the user from serious injury. Placement of a barrier between the cutting tool and teeth is described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The configuration of reaction subsystem <b>24</b> typically will vary depending on which action(s) are taken. In the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reaction subsystem <b>24</b> is configured to stop the movement of cutting tool <b>14</b> and includes a brake mechanism <b>28</b>, a biasing mechanism <b>30</b>, a restraining mechanism <b>32</b>, and a release mechanism <b>34</b>. Brake mechanism <b>28</b> is adapted to engage operative structure <b>12</b> under the urging of biasing mechanism <b>30</b>. During normal operation of machine <b>10</b>, restraining mechanism <b>32</b> holds the brake mechanism out of engagement with the operative structure. However, upon receipt of an activation signal by reaction subsystem <b>24</b>, the brake mechanism is released from the restraining mechanism by release mechanism <b>34</b>, whereupon, the brake mechanism quickly engages at least a portion of the operative structure to bring the cutting tool to a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described above may be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the type and configuration of operative structure <b>12</b>. Turning attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one example of the many possible implementations of safety system <b>18</b> is shown. System <b>18</b> is configured to engage an operative structure having a cutting tool in the form of a circular blade <b>40</b> mounted on a rotating shaft or arbor <b>42</b>. Blade <b>40</b> includes a plurality of cutting teeth (not shown) disposed around the outer edge of the blade.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the exemplary implementation, detection subsystem <b>22</b> is adapted to detect the dangerous condition of the user coming into contact with blade <b>40</b>. The detection subsystem includes a sensor assembly, such as contact detection plates <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, capacitively coupled to blade <b>40</b> to detect any contact between the user's body and the blade. Typically, the blade, or some larger portion of cutting tool <b>14</b> is electrically isolated from the remainder of machine <b>10</b>. Alternatively, detection subsystem <b>22</b> may include a different sensor assembly configured to detect contact in other ways, such as optically, resistively, etc. In any event, the detection subsystem is adapted to transmit a signal to control subsystem <b>26</b> when contact between the user and the blade is detected. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of detection subsystem <b>22</b> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Control subsystem <b>26</b> includes one or more instruments <b>48</b> that are operable by a user to control the motion of blade <b>40</b>. Instruments <b>48</b> may include start/stop switches, speed controls, direction controls, etc. Control subsystem <b>26</b> also includes a logic controller <b>50</b> connected to receive the user's inputs via instruments <b>48</b>. Logic controller <b>50</b> is also connected to receive a contact detection signal from detection subsystem <b>22</b>. Further, the logic controller may be configured to receive inputs from other sources (not shown) such as blade motion sensors, workpiece sensors, etc. In any event, the logic controller is configured to control operative structure <b>12</b> in response to the user's inputs through instruments <b>48</b>. However, upon receipt of a contact detection signal from detection subsystem <b>22</b>, the logic controller overrides the control inputs from the user and activates reaction subsystem <b>24</b> to stop the motion of the blade. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of control subsystem <b>26</b> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the exemplary implementation, brake mechanism <b>28</b> includes a pawl <b>60</b> mounted adjacent the edge of blade <b>40</b> and selectively moveable to engage and grip the teeth of the blade. Pawl <b>60</b> may be constructed of any suitable material adapted to engage and stop the blade. As one example, the pawl may be constructed of a relatively high strength thermoplastic material such as polycarbonate, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) or Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), etc., or a metal such as aluminum, etc. It will be appreciated that the construction of pawl <b>60</b> will vary depending on the configuration of blade <b>40</b>. In any event, the pawl is urged into the blade by a biasing mechanism in the form of a spring <b>66</b>. In the illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pawl <b>60</b> is pivoted into the teeth of blade <b>40</b>. It should be understood that sliding or rotary movement of pawl <b>60</b> might also be used. The spring is adapted to urge pawl <b>60</b> into the teeth of the blade with sufficient force to grip the blade and quickly bring it to a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pawl is held away from the edge of the blade by a restraining mechanism the form of a fusible member <b>70</b>. The fusible member is constructed of a suitable material adapted to restrain the pawl against the bias of spring <b>66</b>, and also adapted to melt under a determined electrical current density. Examples of suitable materials for fusible member <b>70</b> include NiChrome wire, stainless steel wire, etc. The fusible member is connected between the pawl and a contact mount <b>72</b>. Preferably, fusible member <b>70</b> holds the pawl relatively close to the edge of the blade to reduce the distance the pawl must travel to engage the blade. Positioning the pawl relatively close to the edge of the blade reduces the time required for the pawl to engage and stop the blade. Typically, the pawl is held approximately 1/32-inch to &#xbc;-inch from the edge of the blade by fusible member <b>70</b>, however other pawl-to-blade spacings may also be used within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Pawl <b>60</b> is released from its unactuated, or cocked, position to engage blade <b>40</b> by a release mechanism in the form of a firing subsystem <b>76</b>. The firing subsystem is coupled to contact mount <b>72</b>, and is configured to melt fusible member <b>70</b> by passing a surge of electrical current through the fusible member. Firing subsystem <b>76</b> is coupled to logic controller <b>50</b> and activated by a signal from the logic controller. When the logic controller receives a contact detection signal from detection subsystem <b>22</b>, the logic controller sends an activation signal to firing subsystem <b>76</b>, which melts fusible member <b>70</b>, thereby releasing the pawl to stop the blade. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of reaction subsystem <b>24</b> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,056, entitled &#x201c;Firing Subsystem For Use In Fast Acting Safety System,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000 by SD3, LLC, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be appreciated that activation of the brake mechanism will require the replacement of one or more portions of safety system <b>18</b>. For example, pawl <b>60</b> and fusible member <b>70</b> typically must be replaced before the safety system is ready to be used again. Thus, it may be desirable to construct one or more portions of safety system <b>18</b> in a cartridge that can be easily replaced. For example, in the exemplary implementation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, safety system <b>18</b> includes a replaceable cartridge <b>80</b> having a housing <b>82</b>. Pawl <b>60</b>, spring <b>66</b>, fusible member <b>70</b> and contact mount <b>72</b> are all mounted within housing <b>82</b>. Alternatively, other portions of safety system <b>18</b> may be mounted within the housing. In any event, after the reaction system has been activated, the safety system can be reset by replacing cartridge <b>80</b>. The portions of safety system <b>18</b> not mounted within the cartridge may be replaced separately or reused as appropriate. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of a safety system using a replaceable cartridge are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,201, entitled &#x201c;Replaceable Brake Mechanism For Power Equipment,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000 by SD3, LLC, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While one particular implementation of safety system <b>18</b> has been described, it will be appreciated that many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of the invention.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one type of a table saw <b>1400</b>, often called a contractor's saw. It includes a table <b>1401</b> through which a blade <b>1402</b> extends from beneath the table. The table and blade are supported by a housing <b>1403</b> and legs <b>1404</b>. Housing <b>1403</b> encloses the mechanics that support, position and drive the blade. A motor to drive the blade can be positioned in or outside of the housing. A switch <b>1405</b> turns the saw on and off, causing blade <b>1402</b> to spin. Handles, such as handle <b>1406</b>, are used to adjust the position of the blade relative to the table, for example, how far the blade extends above the table or how the blade tilts relative to the top of the table. Of course, table saws take many different configurations, from large saws sized for industrial use to small saws that can be placed on a bench top or counter, and table saws come with various types of tables and housings. Essentially, a table saw is a saw with a flat workspace or &#x201c;table&#x201d; and a cutting blade projecting up through the table. A user places a workpiece on the table and slides it into the blade to cut the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show side elevation views of the internal mechanism one type of table saw configured with a safety system as described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a bottom view of the same saw, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a perspective view.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the saw, blade <b>1402</b> is mounted on an arbor <b>1407</b> by a nut (not shown). The arbor spins the blade in the direction of arrow <b>1409</b>. Table <b>1401</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), which defines the work surface for the table saw, is adjacent the blade and the blade extends above the table.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An arbor block <b>1410</b> supports arbor <b>1407</b> and holds the arbor in bearings to allow the arbor to rotate. The arbor is connected to a motor (not shown), such as by belt extending around a pulley on the arbor and a pulley on the motor's drive shaft, and the motor drives or spins the arbor, as is known in the art. The motor may be mounted on motor plate <b>1411</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Arbor block <b>1410</b> is also mounted on a pin <b>1412</b> and may pivot around that pin. Pin <b>1412</b>, in turn, is mounted to a support member <b>1413</b> that, along with another support member <b>1414</b>, comprise at least part of the supporting frame of the table saw. The supporting frame is connected to the housing, legs, and/or table.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Blade <b>1402</b> is configured to pivot up and down so that a user can position the blade to extend above the table as needed. The blade pivots around pin <b>1412</b>. A user may pivot the blade to adjust its position by turning a shaft <b>1415</b> on which a worm gear <b>1416</b> is mounted. The worm gear is mounted on the shaft so that it turns with the shaft, but so that it may slide on the shaft when necessary, as explained below. Worm gear <b>1416</b> is mounted on shaft <b>1415</b> like a collar, with the shaft extending through a longitudinal hole in the worm gear. The worm gear is held in place during normal operation of the saw by a spring clip <b>1417</b>, which is positioned in a notch or channel on the worm gear and which also engages a detent or groove on shaft <b>1415</b> to hold the worm gear in place. The worm gear engages a rack or segment gear <b>1418</b> that is connected to or part of arbor block <b>1410</b>. Thus, when a user turns shaft <b>1415</b>, such as by turning a knob or handle attached to the shaft, like handle <b>1406</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, worm gear <b>1416</b> moves rack <b>1418</b> and the blade up and down, depending on the direction that the worm gear is turned.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Most table saws are also configured to allow blade <b>1402</b> to tilt from side to side relative to table <b>1401</b>. That is accomplished by a system similar to shaft <b>1415</b>, worm gear <b>1416</b>, and rack <b>1418</b>, but oriented generally perpendicularly to the plane of the blade. Support members <b>1413</b> and <b>1414</b> may be used as part of that system; for example, support member <b>1414</b> may comprise a segment gear or rack like rack <b>1418</b>. The support members include arcuate projections <b>1440</b> that fit into arcuate grooves or slides in mounting blocks (not shown) to allow the support members to pivot. The mounting blocks are secured to the table of the saw.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A brake cartridge <b>1419</b> is mounted in the saw adjacent blade <b>1402</b>. (The cartridge is shown open in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, and shown with a cover in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.) The cartridge may be configured as described above and as described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,201, titled &#x201c;Replaceable Brake Mechanism for Power Equipment,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,212, titled &#x201c;Brake Positioning System,&#x201d; both filed Aug. 14, 2000. The brake cartridge includes a pawl <b>1420</b> biased toward blade <b>1402</b> by a spring <b>1421</b>. Various pawls are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,169, titled &#x201c;Brake Mechanism for Power Equipment,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000. The pawl is held away from blade <b>1402</b> by a release mechanism <b>1422</b>, as described generally above and as described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,170, titled &#x201c;Spring-Biased Brake Mechanism for Power Equipment,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000. The cartridge is configured so that the release mechanism releases the pawl into the blade upon the receipt of a detection signal, as explained generally above and as explained in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,056, titled &#x201c;Firing Subsystem for use in a Fast-Acting Safety System,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000. The detection signal that causes the release of the pawl, and the system or systems to generate that signal, are explained in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,200, titled &#x201c;Contact Detection System for Power Equipment,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,211, titled &#x201c;Apparatus and Method for Detecting Dangerous Conditions in Power Equipment,&#x201d; both filed Aug. 14, 2000. Electronics that form at least part of the system to detect contact between a user and the blade, and then to signal the release of the brake pawl, are enclosed in housing <b>1423</b> mounted on arbor block <b>1410</b>. The housing should be closed to prevent sawdust and other particles from entering the housing and potentially damaging the electronics housed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the pawl is released, the pawl quickly hits the teeth of the blade. The teeth bite into the pawl, stopping the blade. The saw described above can stop the blade in 2-10 milliseconds, thereby reducing the extent of injury caused by accidental contact with the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Brake cartridge <b>1419</b> is positioned on the blade's pivot axis so that pawl <b>1420</b> can move around pin <b>1412</b>. Thus, when pawl <b>1420</b> hits the blade, the angular momentum of the blade is transferred to the arbor, and the blade, arbor, rack and cartridge tend to retract or move down in the direction of arrow <b>1424</b>. The blade will move down to the extent permitted by the contact between rack <b>1418</b> and worm gear <b>1416</b>. If the worm gear is fixed in place, the downward movement of the blade may strip teeth on the rack and/or worm gear, and may prevent the blade from moving down as far as desired. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the worm gear is adapted to snap free and move on shaft <b>1415</b> when the blade hits the pawl.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the blade hits the pawl, the force of the impact causes spring clip <b>1417</b> to snap loose, allowing the worm gear to slide down shaft <b>1415</b> toward an end <b>1425</b> of the shaft. The spring clip snaps loose because the rack is urged down when the blade is stopped, and the rack contacts the worm gear and forces the worm gear to move. The force of the rack against the worm gear causes the spring clip to snap loose. The worm gear then moves into a receptacle <b>1426</b> formed around the end of the shaft. The worm gear is put back in place by simply raising arbor <b>1410</b> up, or by rotating shaft <b>1415</b> to pivot the blade up, which causes the rack to move up and the worm gear to slide back along shaft <b>1415</b> until the spring clip snaps into place on the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The table saw shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> also includes a support <b>1427</b> configured with a seat or region <b>1428</b> in which is placed an impact-absorbing material <b>1429</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, but not in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The support is positioned under the arbor and arbor block so that when the blade retracts, the arbor block strikes impact-absorbing material <b>1429</b>. Support <b>1427</b> and impact-absorbing material <b>1429</b> act as a barrier to stop the downward movement of the blade. The support is positioned so that blade <b>1402</b> may retract a sufficient distance. The impact-absorbing material can be any one of a number of cushioning materials, such as rubber, dense foam, plastic, etc. Alternatively, impact-absorbing material <b>1429</b> may be attached to the undersurface of the arbor block instead of on support <b>1427</b>. Additionally, support <b>1427</b> may take many forms. In fact, shaft <b>1415</b> may be configured and positioned so that it provides a surface to stop the downward movement of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the construction described above, the angular momentum of the blade causes the blade, rack and cartridge to all pivot down when the pawl strikes the blade. Thus, the angular momentum of the blade causes the retraction. Blade <b>1402</b> is permitted to move downward a sufficient distant so that the blade is completely retracted. The ability of the blade to retract minimizes any injury from accidental contact with the blade and works simultaneously with the braking system described above. The ability of the blade to retract is in part because the point around which the blade pivots relative to the direction that the blade spins may be described as on what could be thought of as the &#x201c;back side&#x201d; of existing table saws. The brake cartridge is also mounted on this &#x201c;back side,&#x201d; and may be mounted to pivot with the blade as described above, or may be fixedly mounted to the frame of the saw so it does not pivot with the blade and so that the blade climbs down the pawl when the pawl engages the blade. Other configurations to cause the blade to retract, which can be used alone or in conjunction with the embodiment described herein, are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,089, titled &#x201c;Retraction System for Use in Power Equipment,&#x201d; filed Aug. 14, 2000.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows a splitter <b>1430</b> that extends above table <b>1401</b> behind blade <b>1402</b> to prevent kickback. A blade guard may also substantially enclose blade <b>1402</b> and prevent accidental contact with the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Table saws like those described above can include logic controls to test that the saw and its safety system are functioning properly. For example, the logic controls can verify that the brake pawl is in place adjacent the blade, and that the firing system is ready to release the pawl into the blade upon the detection of accidental contact between the blade and a user. The saws also may include various signals, lights, etc., to inform a user of the status of the saw and the features in operation. Self tests, logic controls and user interfaces are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,059, titled &#x201c;Logic Control for Fast Acting Safety System,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/225,094, titled &#x201c;Motion Detecting System for Use in Safety System for Power Equipment,&#x201d; both filed Aug. 14, 2000.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The table saws described above are configured to absorb the impact of a brake pawl stopping a blade. However, on some table saws, small saws for example, it may be desirable to construct the saw knowing that if the brake pawl stops the blade, the saw would be damaged, perhaps by bending the arbor or other support structure. In fact, the saw may be constructed specifically to absorb the energy of stopping the blade by destroying or damaging part of the saw. Such saws may be thought of as disposable to the extent they are intended to be used only until an accident occurs requiring the brake pawl to stop the blade. A disposable saw may be less expensive to manufacture, and reduced injury to a user in the event of an accident would more than justify the entire cost of the saw.</p>
