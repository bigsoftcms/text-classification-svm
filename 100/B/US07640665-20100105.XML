<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a rotor hub manufacturing method, a workpiece is chucked and a hole centering on the workpiece center axis is formed in the workpiece. A sealing member is press-fit into the hole, forming an internal space. A shaft feature is thereafter shaped in the workpiece by cutting work done on the periphery of the workpiece around the hole. The workpiece part including the shaft feature is then cut away from the workpiece to form a rotor hub as a shaft unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods of manufacturing the shaft unit of an electrically powered motor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hard-disk drives conventionally are equipped with a spindle motor (also referred to simply as &#x201c;motor&#x201d; hereinafter) that rotationally drives the recording disk(s). Such disk-drive motors are provided with a threaded hole into which a clamping member screws for fixing the recording-disk(s) to the motor's rotor hub, which includes a shaft. In some implementations, a shaft-penetrating configuration for the threaded hole is adopted, with the hole being formed heading into the shaft interior through the top endface of the rotor hub.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In implementations in which the threaded hole (or a hole that is linked with the threaded hole) penetrates the shaft, the interior of the motor and the space in which the recording disk(s) is housed communicate via the threaded hole. As a consequence, the space around the recording disk(s), which should stay clean, ends up being invaded by fine particulate matter generated in the motor. This is of particular concern in motors furnished with a fluid dynamic-pressure bearing, in which case the rotor hub is rotationally supported by oil filling a micro-gap in between the shaft and a sleeve for the bearing. In such configurations, the lower end of the shaft is disposed within the oil, which consequently runs the risk that the oil will travel along the inner surface of the threaded hole and invade the recording-disk area of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address such problems with rotor hubs of this sort, in which a through-hole is formed in the shaft, technology whereby the through-hole is sealed to keep clean the space in which the recording disk(s) is housed has been proposed. For example, in the spindle-motor rotor hub art, a spherical elastic member of a diameter that is slightly larger than the through-hole diameter is inserted into the through-hole through the lower-end side of the shaft to plug the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With regard to sealing the through-hole, in implementations in which, in order further to improve the adherence between the through-hole sealing member and the inner surface of the through-hole, a metal fitting, for example, is press-fitted into the through-hole. In this case, there is a likelihood that the shaft, whose diametric span is not substantial, will end up warping, thereby depriving the structure of the tolerances provided by the high precision under which the shaft was machined.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to make available a shaft unit, including at least a shaft of desired conformation, whereby the spaces on either side of the unit's sealing member are reliably isolated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method of manufacturing a shaft unit in one example of the present invention comprises: a step of readying as machining stock a workpiece in which is formed a hole having a mouth on one end oriented along the workpiece center axis, in a state in which the workpiece is retained in a retaining component that on the center axis as its rotational center rotates relative to a cutting tool; and a step of inserting a sealing material inside the hole, to seal the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the manufacturing method just set forth also comprises: a step of performing cutting work on the periphery of the workpiece around the hole to shape a shaft that projects toward the one end with the center axis as its center; and a shaft-unit forming step of forming on the workpiece alongside the other end of the hole with respect to the sealing material a cutting face transecting the center axis, to produce the shaft unit by separating from the workpiece a part thereof including the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, a method of manufacturing a shaft unit in a separate example of the present invention comprises: a step of readying as machining stock a workpiece in which is formed a through-hole centering on the workpiece center axis, in a state in which the workpiece is retained in a retaining component that on the center axis as its rotational center rotates relative to a cutting tool; a step of inserting a sealing material inside the hole, to seal the hole; and a step of performing cutting work on the periphery of the workpiece around the hole to form a shaft, with the center axis as its center, that projects unilaterally with respect to the center axis orientation, and thereby yield a single shaft unit from a single workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">By the present invention, a shaft-unit shaft can be rendered into a desired conformation even as the spaces on either side of the sealing material in the through-hole within the shaft are securely isolated from each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the several views of the drawings, an explanation of several embodiments of the present invention will be made in the following. It should be understood that in the explanation of the present invention, when positional relationships among and orientations of the different components are described as being up/down or left/right, positional relationships and orientations that are in the drawings are indicated; however, the ultimate positional relationships among and orientations of the components once having been assembled into an actual device might not be indicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a view representing the internal makeup of a disk-drive device <b>60</b> in which an electrically powered spindle motor <b>1</b> (termed &#x201c;motor <b>1</b>&#x201d; hereinafter) involving a first embodiment of the present invention is installed. In the present embodiment, the disk-drive device <b>60</b> is a hard-disk drive. By virtue of a housing <b>61</b>, the interior of the disk-drive device <b>60</b> is a rendered a clean space where dust and debris are minimized to the utmost, and wherein round platelike recording disks <b>62</b> for recording information, an accessing module <b>63</b> for reading information from and (or) writing information onto the recording disks <b>62</b>, and the motor <b>1</b>, which is for spinning the recording disks <b>62</b>, are accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The accessing module <b>63</b> includes heads <b>631</b> that the module brings near the recording disks <b>62</b> to carry out magnetic reading and writing of information, arms <b>632</b> that support the heads <b>631</b>, and a head-shifting mechanism <b>633</b> that varies the position of the heads <b>631</b> relative to the recording disks <b>62</b> by shifting the arms <b>632</b>. By the configurational organization of these components, the heads <b>631</b>, brought near the recording disks <b>62</b>, access the requisite positions on the recording disks <b>62</b> to perform the reading and writing of information.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a vertical section view illustrating the makeup of the disk-driving motor <b>1</b>. The motor <b>1</b> comprises a stationary section <b>2</b>, which is a stator assembly, and a rotor part <b>3</b>, which is a rotary assembly. The rotor part <b>3</b> is rotatably supported with respect to the stationary section <b>2</b> by a bearing mechanism employing hydrodynamic pressure derived from lubricating oil.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The stationary section <b>2</b> comprises a baseplate <b>21</b>, an approximately circular cylindrical sleeve <b>22</b> that rotatably supports the rotor part <b>3</b>, and a stator <b>24</b> disposed about the perimeter of the sleeve <b>22</b>. The lower part of the sleeve <b>22</b> is press-fitted and thereby fixed into a sleeve-retaining portion <b>211</b> of the baseplate <b>21</b>, protruding in the form of an approximately circular cylinder from the baseplate central area, and a flange <b>221</b> bulging outwardly with respect to center axis J<b>1</b> forms an integral portion of the upper part of the sleeve <b>22</b>. The opening along the lower end of the sleeve <b>22</b> is closed off by an approximately disk-shaped sealing cap <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The stator <b>24</b> comprises a core constituted by laminating silicon steel plates, and coils wound onto the magnetic poles of the core, and is anchored to the baseplate <b>21</b>. Furthermore, the stator <b>24</b> coils are connected to a not-illustrated current supply circuit, whereby the supplied electric current is controlled. Over the stator <b>24</b> an approximately annular magnetic-shield plate <b>25</b> formed of a ferromagnetic substance is provided centering on center axis J<b>1</b>; the magnetic field from the stator <b>24</b> is blocked off by the magnetic shield plate <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotor part <b>3</b> is made up of a rotor hub <b>31</b> that supports all portions of the rotor part <b>3</b>, a retaining member <b>33</b> that prevents the rotor part <b>3</b> from separating from the stationary section <b>2</b>, and a field magnet <b>34</b> that together with the stator <b>24</b> generates the rotational force (torque) that spins the rotor part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rotor hub <b>31</b> is made up of an approximately circular cylindrical shaft <b>311</b> centering on center axis J<b>1</b> and projecting downward (i.e., toward the stationary section <b>2</b>), an approximately disk-shaped circular plate part <b>312</b> that perpendicularly with respect to center axis J<b>1</b> flares from the upper end portion of the shaft <b>311</b>, and a roughly tubular cylindrical part <b>313</b> that projects downward from, along the outer rim of, the circular plate part <b>312</b>. The rotor hub <b>31</b> is formed unitarily from stainless steel, and the portion apart from the shaft <b>311</b> is roughly in the form of bowl that opens downward. The upper end of the shaft <b>311</b> is its fixed end, while the lower end is its free end. A disk-carrying section <b>314</b> that bulges outward is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part <b>313</b>; the disks <b>62</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are set onto the disk-carrying section <b>314</b> and fixed to the rotor hub <b>31</b> by means of a not-illustrated clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rotor hub <b>31</b> is fashioned in roughly columnar form with center axis J<b>1</b> as the center, comprises the circular plate part <b>312</b>, and is furnished with a through-hole <b>3110</b> that penetrates the shaft <b>311</b>. Internal threads into which the clamp screw-fastens are formed in the upper portion of the through-hole <b>3110</b>. Furthermore, an approximately spherical sealing member <b>35</b> made of metal is inserted into the lower portion of the through-hole <b>3110</b>. In the rotor hub <b>31</b>, the through-hole <b>3110</b> is plugged (i.e., sealed) by the sealing member <b>35</b>, dividing the through-hole <b>3110</b> into an upper space <b>3111</b> and a lower space <b>3112</b> that are isolated from each other. In addition, the sealing member <b>35</b> along the lower space <b>3112</b> is further sealed by means of an adhesive <b>351</b>, wherein the upper space <b>3111</b> and the lower space <b>3112</b> are more securely isolated from each other. As a result, lubricating oil and other matter in the interior of the motor <b>1</b> are positively prevented from invading the space around the recording disks <b>62</b>, which must be kept clean.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An outer tubular member <b>32</b>, circularly cylindrical in form, is attached to the outer periphery of the shaft <b>311</b>. The outer tubular member <b>32</b> is adhesively fixed to the outer circumferential surface of the shaft <b>311</b>, with a journal <b>30</b> portion of the rotor part <b>3</b> being constituted by the shaft <b>311</b> and the outer tubular member <b>32</b>. The journal <b>30</b> is rotatably inserted into the sleeve <b>22</b> of the stationary section <b>2</b>, whereby the rotor hub <b>31</b> is supported rotatably with respect to the stationary section <b>2</b>. Center axis J<b>1</b> of the shaft <b>311</b> (which is the center axis of the journal <b>30</b> as well) is the rotational center axis of the rotor part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The retaining member <b>33</b>, an annular component that is centered on center axis J<b>1</b>, is affixed to the inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical part <b>313</b> of the rotor hub <b>31</b>, such that along the underside of the flange portion <b>221</b> of the sleeve <b>22</b>, the retaining member <b>33</b> bulges inward, toward center axis J<b>1</b>. By this configuration the journal <b>30</b> is kept from coming out of the sleeve <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The field magnet <b>34</b>, an annular component that is centered on center axis J<b>1</b>, is permanently magnetized with circumferentially alternating poles, and is affixed to the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part <b>313</b> of the rotor hub <b>31</b>. The field magnet <b>34</b> diametrically opposes the stator <b>24</b> across a gap. The magnetic center of the field magnet <b>34</b> axially and the magnetic center of the stator <b>24</b> axially are approximately coincident. Beneath the field magnet <b>34</b>, an annular thrust yoke <b>26</b> that is ferromagnetic is attached to the bottom portion of the baseplate <b>21</b>. By the force of magnetic attraction between the field magnet <b>34</b> and the thrust yoke <b>26</b>, the rotor part <b>3</b> is drawn toward the baseplate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the bearing mechanism of the motor <b>1</b>, in which hydrodynamic pressure is employed for rotatably supporting the rotor part <b>3</b> on the stationary part <b>2</b>, will be explained. In the motor <b>1</b>, micro-gaps are provided between the undersurface of the circular plate part <b>312</b> of the rotor hub <b>31</b> and the top endface of the sleeve <b>22</b>, between the inner circumferential surface of the sleeve <b>22</b> and the outer circumferential surface of the outer tubular member <b>32</b>, between the bottom endface of the outer tubular member <b>32</b> and the top surface of the sealing cap <b>23</b>, and between the outer circumferential surface of the flange portion <b>221</b> of the sleeve <b>22</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical part <b>313</b> of the rotor hub <b>31</b>. In the following, these gaps will respectively be referred to as the &#x201c;upper gap,&#x201d; the &#x201c;lateral gap,&#x201d; the &#x201c;lower gap,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;outside gap.&#x201d; Lubricating oil continuously fills these gaps. In the motor <b>1</b>, the lower-end mouth of the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the shaft <b>311</b> is situated within the lubricating oil lying on the sealing cap <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The periphery of the sleeve flange portion <b>221</b> includes a sloping surface where the peripheral diameter tapers heading axially downward. The cylindrical part <b>313</b> is formed with a constant inner diameter along its inner circumferential surface where it opposes the outer circumferential surface of the flange portion <b>221</b>. This configuration results in the boundary surface of the lubricating oil in the outside gap forming a meniscus by virtue of capillary action and surface tension, creating a taper seal whereby the outside gap serves as an oil buffer preventing outflow of the lubricating oil.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Grooves (in spiral form, for example) for developing in the lubricating oil pressure directed toward center axis J<b>1</b> when the rotor part <b>3</b> spins are formed in the top endface of the sleeve <b>22</b>, wherein a thrust dynamic-pressure bearing section is constituted by means of the upper gap. Likewise, helical grooves that from the upper gap continue to the lower gap are furnished in the outer circumferential surface of the shaft <b>311</b> that is a constituent of the journal <b>30</b>, whereby the pressure of the lubricating oil in the lower gap is equalized with the elevated pressure of the lubricating oil in the upper gap, and thus the lower gap functions as a thrust static-pressure bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Meanwhile, formed in the surfaces opposing each other in the lateral gap are grooves (such as herringbone grooves, for example, provided in upper and lower areas, relative to the way in which center axis J<b>1</b> is oriented, of the outer circumferential surface of the outer tubular member <b>32</b>) for developing hydrodynamic pressure in the lubricating oil, wherein a radial dynamic-pressure bearing section is constituted by means of the lateral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the motor <b>1</b>, with the bearing mechanism being a hydrodynamic pressure bearing, the non-contact supporting of the rotor part <b>3</b> via the lubricating oil enables the rotor part <b>3</b> to spin with high precision and low noise. In particular, in the bearing mechanism described above, because air does not intervene in the bearing interior, abnormal contact between the journal <b>30</b> and the sleeve <b>22</b>, originating in air bubbles generated within the lubricating oil, lubricating oil leakage due to air in the bearing interior expanding, and similar problems are kept all the more under control.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus the rotor part <b>3</b> is rotatably supported on the stationary section <b>2</b> by means of a bearing mechanism employing hydrodynamic pressure from a lubricating oil, and controlled supplying of current to the stator <b>24</b> drives, by means of magnetic action between the field magnet <b>34</b> and the stator <b>24</b>, the rotor part <b>3</b> rotationally with respect to the stationary section <b>2</b>, with center axis J<b>1</b> of the journal <b>30</b> (which is also the center axis of the sleeve <b>22</b>) as the rotational center.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a method of manufacturing the rotor hub <b>31</b> will be explained. Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a chart setting forth operational flow in the manufacture of the rotor hub <b>31</b>, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4H</figref>, which are section views representing successive stages in the course of manufacturing the rotor hub <b>31</b>. When a rotor hub <b>31</b> is to be manufactured, a round rod-shaped workpiece <b>9</b>, which is the machining stock, is prepared, and as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the workpiece <b>9</b> is held by means of a chuck <b>81</b>, which is the retaining device in a numerical-control (NC) lathe (Step S<b>11</b>). The chuck <b>81</b> rotates, on predetermined center axis J<b>2</b> as the rotational center, relative to a tool (i.e., an implement such as a twist drill or lathe bit) while retaining the workpiece <b>9</b> along its outer circumferential side with its center axis made closely coincident with center axis J<b>2</b> of the chuck <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, into the workpiece <b>9</b> rotating together with the chuck <b>81</b><i>a </i>hole <b>91</b><i>a </i>centering on center axis J<b>2</b> is formed by means of a drill <b>82</b><i>a</i>, in one side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) with respect to the orientation along center axis J<b>2</b>. Hereinafter, the endface <b>92</b> on the side of the workpiece <b>9</b> in which the hole <b>91</b><i>a </i>is formed will be termed the &#x201c;machining start face <b>92</b>.&#x201d; Subsequently, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, by means of a drill <b>82</b><i>b </i>whose diameter is greater than that of drill <b>82</b><i>a </i>(cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), a hole <b>91</b><i>b </i>centering on center axis J<b>2</b> is formed, fashioned so as to overlie hole <b>91</b><i>a</i>, into the machining start face <b>92</b> side of the workpiece <b>9</b> (Step S<b>12</b>). Hereinafter, holes <b>91</b><i>a </i>and <b>91</b><i>b</i>, formed by the two different drills <b>82</b><i>a </i>and <b>82</b><i>b</i>, will together be referred to as &#x201c;hole <b>91</b>.&#x201d; Hole <b>91</b>, centering on center axis J<b>2</b>, ultimately becomes the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the rotor hub <b>31</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. With hole <b>91</b> having been formed, internal threads as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> are formed in hole <b>91</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the next stage, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the sealing member <b>35</b>, made of metal and in the form of cross-sectionally round globe having a diameter greater than that of hole <b>91</b><i>b</i>, is press-fitted into hole <b>91</b><i>b </i>(i.e., inserted while force is applied to it, or is pressed in while force is applied to it) through the machining start face <b>92</b> side of the workpiece <b>9</b>. In the workpiece <b>9</b>, hole <b>91</b> is sealed by the sealing member <b>35</b> having been inserted into hole <b>91</b>, with an internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>isolated from the exterior being formed on the side of the sealing member <b>35</b> opposite the machining start face <b>92</b> (Step S<b>13</b>). The internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>is constituted by hole <b>91</b><i>a </i>and a portion of hole <b>91</b><i>b</i>. Since the sealing member <b>35</b> is deformed by being press-fit into hole <b>91</b>, it is adhered fast to the inner circumferential surface of the hole <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>having been formed, the workpiece <b>9</b> (especially in the proximity of the sealing member <b>35</b>) is according to requirements washed and then dried. Then, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, an adhesive <b>351</b> is supplied through the machining start face <b>92</b> side of the workpiece <b>9</b> into the area on the left side of the sealing member <b>35</b> (along the mouth of hole <b>91</b>) that includes the interval between the sealing member <b>35</b> and hole <b>91</b><i>b </i>(in particular, alongside the mouth of hole <b>91</b>, about the periphery of the sealing member <b>35</b> in the vicinity of the region where it adheres with the inner circumferential surface of hole <b>91</b><i>b</i>), and is cured within hole <b>91</b><i>b </i>(Step S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the adhesive <b>351</b> having cured, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>, by cutting operations into the workpiece <b>9</b> around the periphery of hole <b>91</b> using a lathe bit <b>83</b>, a feature that projects toward the machining start face <b>92</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) and is centered on center axis J<b>2</b> is shaped. This &#x201c;feature&#x201d; as it has just been termed is the part that forms the shaft <b>311</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and thus will be denoted &#x201c;shaft <b>311</b>&#x201d; in the following. Likewise, a roughly cylindrical feature (i.e., the workpiece part forming the cylindrical part <b>313</b>&#x2014;thus referred to as &#x201c;cylindrical part <b>313</b>&#x201d; below) that juts toward the machining start face <b>92</b> is shaped by cutting operations using the lathe bit <b>83</b> on the workpiece <b>9</b> in the proximity of its rim portion (Step S<b>15</b>). It will be appreciated that although a state in which the part that includes the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> features has been cut away from the workpiece <b>9</b> is portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>, at the time the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> are shaped as described above, this part still has not been separated from the workpiece <b>9</b>. It will also be appreciated that the type of lathe bit <b>83</b> employed to shape the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> may be changed to suit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> having been shaped, in the proximity of the end portion of the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>on the side opposite the machining start face <b>92</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), the part that includes the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> features is cut away from the workpiece <b>9</b> through a sectioning plane that is perpendicular to center axis J<b>2</b> and that includes the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>(i.e., columnar hole <b>91</b><i>a</i>). By this operation, a part including the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> features is obtained (Step S<b>16</b>) as the rotor hub <b>31</b>, which is a shaft unit under the present embodiment. In the rotor hub <b>31</b>, the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>where it opens onto the side opposite the sealing member <b>35</b> constitutes the upper space <b>3111</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Likewise, the space flanking the sealing member <b>35</b> on the side opposite the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>constitutes the lower space <b>3112</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The rotor hub <b>31</b> having been cut away from the workpiece <b>9</b> is retained (Step S<b>17</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</figref>, along the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical part <b>313</b> by means of another chuck <b>84</b>, situated on the rotor-hub side from which the shaft <b>311</b> projects. The surface of the rotor hub <b>31</b> on the side opposite the side from which the shaft <b>311</b> projects is then cut using the bit <b>83</b> or cutting tool to shape the circular plate part <b>312</b> (Step S<b>18</b>). After that, the rotor hub <b>31</b> is given another wash using a washing or other cleaning device, which completes the manufacture of the rotor hub <b>31</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As an example for comparison with the above-described method of manufacturing the rotor hub <b>31</b>, a manufacturing method in which the sealing member is inserted after forming the shaft will be explained.

Internal threads are then formed along a portion of the hole <b>791</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Subsequently, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the lathe bit <b>83</b> is used to cut into the workpiece <b>79</b>, retained by the chuck <b>81</b>, around the periphery of the hole <b>791</b>, forming a projecting shaft <b>7311</b> with center axis J<b>2</b> of the chuck <b>81</b> as its center. Meanwhile, a roughly round tubular cylindrical part <b>7313</b> that projects in the same direction as the shaft <b>7311</b> is shaped by cutting operations using the lathe bit <b>83</b> on the workpiece <b>79</b> in the proximity of its rim portion (Step S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With the shaft <b>7311</b> and cylindrical part <b>7313</b> having been shaped, in the proximity of the end portion of the workpiece <b>791</b> on the side opposite its open side, the part that includes the shaft <b>7311</b> and cylindrical part <b>7313</b> features is cut away from the workpiece <b>79</b> through a sectioning plane that is perpendicular to center axis J<b>2</b> and that includes the hole <b>791</b><i>a</i>. By this operation, a part including the shaft <b>7311</b> and cylindrical part <b>7313</b> features is obtained (Step S<b>24</b>) as the rotor hub <b>731</b>, which is a shaft unit according to the present example. In the rotor hub <b>731</b>, the hole <b>791</b> is a through-hole penetrating the rotor hub <b>731</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The rotor hub <b>731</b> having been cut away is retained (Step S<b>25</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, along the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical part <b>7313</b> by means of the chuck <b>84</b>, situated on the rotor-hub side from which the shaft <b>7311</b> projects. The surface of the rotor hub <b>731</b> on the side opposite the side from which the shaft <b>7311</b> projects is then cut using the bit <b>83</b> or other cutting tool to shape a rotor-hub circular plate part <b>7312</b> (Step S<b>26</b>). Subsequently, after the rotor hub <b>731</b> has been washed, it is mounted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> with the circular plate part <b>7312</b> made the bottom side, and into the hole <b>791</b> formed in the shaft <b>7311</b>, through the mouth on the side opposite the circular plate part <b>7312</b> side, a sealing member <b>735</b> having a diameter greater than that of the mouth is press-fit (Steps S<b>27</b>, S<b>28</b>). The sealing member <b>735</b> is globular and fashioned from metal. Thereafter, by supplying an adhesive <b>7351</b> into interval between the sealing member <b>735</b> and the hole <b>791</b>, through the mouth on the side of the hole <b>791</b> opposite its circular plate part <b>7312</b> side, and curing the adhesive, the manufacturing procedure is completed (Step S<b>29</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the manufacturing method of the comparative example as described in the foregoing, the fact that the sealing member <b>735</b> is press-fitted after formation of the shaft <b>7311</b> runs the risk that the shaft <b>7311</b> will warp, or like occurrences will arise, on account of the press-fitting of the sealing member <b>735</b>. Yet attempting to keep the shaft <b>7311</b> from warping would require employing a sealing member <b>735</b> of comparatively small diameter, creating the likelihood that the sealing of the hole <b>791</b> would be insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In contrast, in the rotor hub <b>31</b> manufacturing method involving the first embodiment of the present invention, the sealing member <b>35</b> is press-fit into the hole <b>91</b> in the workpiece <b>9</b> in a state in which the bulk surrounding the hole <b>91</b>, being massive (relative to the shaft <b>311</b>), is highly strong, and thereafter the periphery about the hole <b>91</b> is cut to shape the shaft <b>311</b>. The method therefore makes it possible to prevent impact on the conformation of the shaft <b>311</b> due to the insertion of the sealing member <b>35</b> (for example, impact such as a slight distorting of the shaft <b>311</b> that bulges the surface). An additional benefit is that the shaft <b>311</b> can be rendered into a desired conformation even as the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> in the through-hole <b>3110</b> within the shaft <b>311</b> (i.e., the upper space <b>3111</b> and lower space <b>3112</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are securely isolated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The conformational precision of the shaft <b>311</b> can be made high even in a manufacturing method that involves press-fitting the sealing member <b>35</b> into the shaft <b>311</b>. In addition, the fact that the sealing member <b>35</b> is made of metal enables securely isolating the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> from each other. Accordingly, utilizing a thus-fashioned rotor hub <b>31</b> in the motor <b>1</b> more positively prevents lubricating oil and other matter in the interior of the motor <b>1</b> from invading the space around the recording disks <b>62</b>, which must be kept clean.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the manufacturing method set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the step (Step S<b>14</b>) in which the adhesive <b>351</b> is supplied and cured in between the sealing member <b>35</b> and hole <b>91</b><i>b </i>is in between the step (Step S<b>13</b>) in which the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>is formed, and the step (Step S<b>15</b>) in which the shaft <b>311</b> is formed. This enables the spaces <b>91</b><i>a </i>and <b>91</b><i>b </i>on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b>, positively isolated from each other by the metal sealing member <b>35</b>, to be kept more securely segregated. This also makes it possible to prevent impact on the conformation of the shaft <b>311</b> due to shrinking or other factors when the adhesive <b>351</b> cures, which could occur in a situation assuming that the adhesive <b>351</b> is supplied and cured in an operation parallel to the formation of the shaft <b>311</b>, or in a situation as in the manufacturing method of the comparative example, in which the adhesive <b>7351</b> is supplied and cured after formation of the shaft <b>7311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Of further note is that in the first embodiment as described above, being able to securely isolate the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> from each other means that the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the rotor hub <b>31</b> can be securely sealed. This makes it possible, in a motor <b>1</b> furnished with a hydrodynamic pressure bearing in which the lower-end mouth of the through-hole <b>3110</b> is situated within the lubricating oil, to reliably prevent the lubricating oil from traveling along the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole <b>3110</b> and invading the recording-disk area. Consequently, a manufacturing method involving the first embodiment of the present invention should be especially suited to the manufacture of rotor hubs <b>31</b> for motors <b>1</b> furnished with a hydrodynamic pressure bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, in a manufacturing method involving the first embodiment, forming the rotor hub <b>31</b> with the shaft <b>311</b>, the circular plate part <b>312</b>, and the cylindrical part <b>313</b> as single component makes it possible to realize downsizing (in particular, flattening) of the rotor hub <b>31</b> and the motor <b>1</b>, and improvement in the precision with which the rotor hub <b>31</b> is machined. And the rotor hub <b>31</b> can be manufactured through only two different chucking operations (that is, the number of times the material that will become the rotor hub <b>31</b> is chucked is only twice&#x2014;by chuck <b>81</b> and chuck <b>84</b>). This consequently abates rotor hub <b>31</b> precisional decline otherwise due to the added number of times that the rotor-hub forming material would be chucked, and lessens cost increases, etc. owing to chucking operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a sectional view representing a stage in the course of fashioning a rotor hub <b>31</b> manufactured according to a second manufacturing method of the present invention. In the second manufacturing method, likewise as in the foregoing first embodiment, a hole <b>91</b> is formed in a workpiece <b>9</b>, the hole <b>91</b> is sealed by means of the sealing member <b>35</b> and the adhesive <b>351</b>, forming internal space <b>91</b><i>c</i>, after which the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> are shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the part of the workpiece <b>9</b> that includes the shaft <b>311</b> and cylindrical part <b>313</b> features is cut away from the workpiece <b>9</b> through a position that is more rightward than the internal space <b>91</b><i>c</i>, and that does not include the internal space <b>91</b><i>c</i>. At this point, the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>forms a saclike space that is not linked with exterior space.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The workpiece part having been cut away is then retained along the outer circumferential side of the cylindrical part <b>313</b> by means of the chuck <b>84</b>, and a hole heading toward the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>is bored with a drill <b>85</b> through the side of the part along the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>opposite the machining start face <b>92</b>. Thus, by forming through the internal space <b>91</b><i>c </i>an opening that opens on the opposite side from the sealing member <b>35</b>, i.e., an opening that opens on the side of the part opposite the side of the sealing member <b>35</b> where the shaft <b>311</b> juts out, a rotor hub <b>31</b> that is a shaft unit under this embodiment is formed. After that, similarly as in the first embodiment, the surface on the side of the rotor hub <b>31</b> opposite the side from which the shaft <b>311</b> projects undergoes a cutting operation that shapes the circular plate part, and the rotor hub <b>31</b> is then washed, whereby its manufacture is completed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, a method of manufacturing a rotor hub as a spindle-motor shaft unit involving a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The rotor hub manufactured in the third embodiment has the same structure as that of rotor hub <b>31</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and thus in the following explanation the same reference marks are appended to the constituents. Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is a chart setting forth operational flow in the manufacture of the rotor hub, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9E</figref>, which are sectional views representing successive stages in the course of manufacturing the rotor hub <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At first, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, an approximately disk-shaped workpiece <b>9</b><i>a</i>, which is the machining stock, is prepared and is retained by means of the chuck <b>81</b> on the NC lathe (Step S<b>31</b>). In the manufacturing method of the third embodiment, the thickness of the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>in the orientation along its center axis is about the same as the thickness of the rotor hub <b>31</b> that is being manufactured, and thus a single rotor hub <b>31</b> is shaped from a single workpiece <b>9</b><i>a</i>. The chuck <b>81</b> rotates, on predetermined center axis J<b>2</b> as the rotational center, relative to the tool while retaining the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>along its outer circumferential side with its center axis made closely coincident with center axis J<b>2</b> of the chuck <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>having been chucked, after a suitable endface shaping operation has been carried out, a through-hole centering on center axis J<b>2</b> and penetrating the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>is formed through one side (i.e., the machining start face <b>92</b> side) with respect to the orientation along center axis J<b>2</b> (Step S<b>32</b>). Here, this just-described through-hole is the hole that forms the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the shaft <b>311</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> once the manufacture of the rotor hub <b>31</b> has been completed, and thus will be denoted &#x201c;through-hole <b>3110</b>&#x201d; below. Internal threads are then formed in a region of the through-hole <b>3110</b> on the side opposite the machining start face <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Subsequently, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a sealing member <b>35</b>, made of metal and in the form of a globe having a diameter greater than that of the region of the through-hole <b>3110</b> on its machining start face <b>92</b> side, is press-fitted (i.e., inserted while force is applied to it) into the through-hole <b>3110</b> through machining start face <b>92</b> side (Step S<b>33</b>). By being press-fit into the through-hole <b>3110</b>, the sealing member <b>35</b> deforms and thereby adheres to the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole <b>3110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With the through-hole <b>3110</b> having been sealed, the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>is according to requirements washed and then dried. Next, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, an adhesive <b>351</b> is supplied through the machining start face <b>92</b> side of the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>into the area on the left side of the sealing member <b>35</b> that includes the interval between the sealing member <b>35</b> and the through-hole <b>3110</b>, and the adhesive <b>351</b> is cured within the through-hole <b>3110</b> (Step S<b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With the adhesive <b>351</b> having cured, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, cutting operations into the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>around the periphery of the through-hole <b>3110</b> are performed. Thus, the shaft <b>311</b> centered on center axis J<b>2</b> and projecting unilaterally (in the present embodiment, toward the machining start face <b>92</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) in the orientation along center axis J<b>2</b> is shaped. Meanwhile, a roughly round tubular cylindrical part <b>313</b> that projects toward the machining start face <b>92</b> is shaped on the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a</i>, in the proximity of the rim portion thereof (Step S<b>35</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, the cylindrical part <b>313</b> is retained along its outer circumferential side by means of the other chuck <b>84</b>, situated on the workpiece side from which the shaft <b>311</b> projects (Step S<b>36</b>). The surface of the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>on the side opposite the side from which the shaft <b>311</b> projects is then cut using the bit <b>83</b> to shape a rotor-hub circular plate part <b>312</b> (Step S<b>37</b>). Through the Step S<b>37</b> operations, a rotor hub <b>312</b> that is a shaft unit according to the present embodiment is formed. Thereafter, the rotor hub <b>31</b> is then washed, which completes the manufacture of the rotor hub <b>31</b> (Step S<b>38</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described in the foregoing, in the rotor hub <b>31</b> manufacturing method involving the third embodiment, the sealing member <b>35</b> is press-fit into the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>in a state in which the bulk surrounding the through-hole <b>3110</b>, being massive relative to the shaft <b>311</b>, is highly strong. After that, the periphery about the through-hole <b>3110</b> is cut to shape the shaft <b>311</b>. As is the case with the first embodiment, the method in this embodiment therefore makes it possible to prevent impact on the conformation of the shaft <b>311</b> due to the insertion of the sealing member <b>35</b>. An additional benefit is that the shaft <b>311</b> of the rotor hub <b>31</b> can be rendered into a desired conformation even as the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> in the through-hole <b>3110</b> are securely isolated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With the manufacturing method in the third embodiment, as is the case with the first embodiment, the conformational precision of the shaft <b>311</b> can be made high even in a manufacturing method that involves press-fitting the sealing member <b>35</b> into the through-hole <b>3110</b>. In addition, the metal sealing member <b>35</b> makes it possible to securely isolate the spaces on either side (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, to the left and right) of the sealing member <b>35</b> from each other. Accordingly, utilizing a thus-fashioned rotor hub <b>31</b> in the spindle motor for a disk-drive device more positively prevents lubricating oil and other matter in the interior of the motor from invading the space around the recording disk(s), which must be kept clean. A manufacturing method involving the third embodiment should be especially suited to the manufacture of rotor hubs <b>31</b> for motors furnished with a hydrodynamic pressure bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With a manufacturing method involving the third embodiment, moreover, in the same way as with the first embodiment, impact on the conformation of the shaft <b>311</b> due to shrinking or other factors when the adhesive <b>351</b> cures can be prevented, while the through-hole <b>3110</b> can be more securely sealed by the adhesive <b>351</b>. What is more, downsizing (in particular, flattening) of the rotor hub <b>31</b> and of a motor utilizing the rotor hub <b>31</b>, and improvement in the precision with which the rotor hub <b>31</b> is machined can be realized. And precisional decline in the rotor hub <b>31</b> otherwise due to the added number of times that the rotor-hub forming material would be chucked is abated, as are cost increases, etc. owing to chucking operations.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">While modes of embodying the present invention have been described above, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments, in that various modifications are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In each embodiment described above, the form of the sealing member <b>35</b> is not limited to being globular; for example, a sealing member in a form such as discoid or circularly columnar may be press-fit into the hole <b>91</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> (or the through-hole <b>3110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Furthermore, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, with a discoid sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>having been press-fit into the mouth of the shaft <b>311</b> on the side opposite the circular plate part <b>312</b>, instead of adhesive being supplied in between the sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>and the through-hole <b>3110</b>, the sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>and the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole <b>3110</b> may be welded with a laser welding device <b>86</b>. The spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>(top and bottom sides of the sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) are thereby more securely isolated from each other. Likewise, with a circularly columnar sealing member in lieu of the discoid sealing member <b>35</b><i>a </i>having been press-fit into the shaft <b>311</b>, the sealing member and the inner circumferential surface of the through-hole <b>3110</b> may be welded. It will be appreciated that in implementations in which the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> are sufficiently segregated without the adhesive <b>351</b> or without carrying out the welding operation, the supplying of adhesive <b>351</b>, or the welding just described may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The sealing member <b>35</b> is not limited to being metal; as long it as has a definite form the member may be, for example, a rubber substance such as acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), a synthetic resin, or various other types of elastic or like material. In this respect, manufacturing methods involving the foregoing embodiments are especially suited to implementations in which the sealing of the through-hole <b>3110</b> in the shaft <b>311</b> is carried out by press-fitting a sealing member <b>35</b> having a definite form.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the rotor hub <b>31</b>, it is not required that the sealing member <b>35</b> that is pres-fit into the hole <b>91</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> (or the through-hole depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) necessarily have a definite form. For example, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in place of the sealing member <b>35</b>, by means of a sealing material <b>35</b><i>b </i>such as an adhesive supplied (i.e., inserted) into and fixed within the hole <b>91</b>, the spaces on either side of the sealing material <b>35</b><i>b </i>(left and right sides of the sealing material <b>35</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) may be securely isolated from each other. In this case as well, because prior to forming the shaft <b>311</b> the sealing material <b>35</b><i>b </i>is supplied into the hole <b>91</b> and cured, impact on the conformation of the shaft <b>311</b> due to shrinking or other factors when the sealing material <b>35</b><i>b </i>cures can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In each of the foregoing embodiments, methods of manufacturing a rotor hub <b>31</b> being a shaft unit that includes a shaft <b>311</b>, a circular plate part <b>312</b>, and a cylindrical part <b>313</b> have been described. Yet a manufacturing method involving any of the foregoing embodiments can also be applied to instances in which, for example, the base of a motor stationary section having a shaft is manufactured as a shaft unit.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, the shaft unit need only include the shaft <b>311</b>; thus, a manufacturing method involving the first embodiment is also applicable in implementations in which the shaft unit is the shaft <b>311</b> itself. In particular, the hole <b>91</b> would be formed in the workpiece <b>9</b> and the sealing member <b>35</b> press-fit into the hole <b>91</b> to create the internal space <b>91</b><i>c</i>. The shaft <b>311</b> would then be shaped by cutting work on the periphery of the workpiece <b>9</b> around the hole <b>91</b>, and then would be cut away from the workpiece <b>9</b>. Thereafter, a shaft <b>311</b> of desired conformation, yet in which the spaces on either side of the sealing member <b>35</b> are securely isolated form each other, would be shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another possible modification, a workpiece <b>9</b> in which a hole <b>91</b> has been preformed, or a pipe-shaped workpiece <b>9</b> in which a through-hole has been preformed may be retained by means of the chuck <b>81</b>, to ready machining stock in which is formed a hole having a mouth on at least one side in the orientation along the center axis J<b>2</b>, in a state in which the stock is chucked in the chuck <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A further modification would be that in the third embodiment, a ring-shaped workpiece <b>9</b><i>a </i>in which the through-hole <b>3110</b> has been preformed may be retained by means of the chuck <b>81</b>, to ready machining stock in which is formed a through-hole centering on the center axis J<b>2</b>, in a state in which the stock is chucked in the chuck <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is not required that a motor involving any of the foregoing embodiments necessarily be a so-called inner-rotor type in which a field magnet <b>34</b> is disposed alongside the center axis J<b>1</b> of the stator <b>24</b>. For example, the motor may be an outer-rotor type in which the field magnet <b>34</b> is disposed along the outer side of the stator <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Also, the motor bearing mechanism may be, for example, ball bearings. In that case, the sealing member <b>35</b> would securely prevent the ball-bearing grease and like material from invading the space that must be kept clean around the recording disks <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The disk-drive device <b>60</b> having a motor involving any of the embodiments described above is not limited to being a hard-disk drive, and may be a disk-drive device such as a removable-disk drive.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Only selected embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the present invention. To those skilled in the art, however, it will be apparent from the foregoing disclosure that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
