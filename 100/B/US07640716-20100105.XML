<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a 371 of PCT/EP2005/056160 filed 22 Nov. 2005.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for manufacturing foam cushions in particular for packaging purposes, said device comprising a foil supply station and a foam dispensing station, said foil supply station being provided for supplying to said foam dispensing station a foil material, having a first and a second side wall joining each other at a common first border and positioned so as to delimit an inner space accessible by an opening applied in a second border, said foam dispensing station comprising first retaining means, provided for retaining said second border, said foam dispensing station further comprising a dispensing member, provided for penetrating through said opening and supplying a foaming substance into said inner space, said device further comprising transport means, provided for transporting said foil material through said dispensing station towards a welding station, said welding station comprising a welding member, provided for applying a closure weld on said foil material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a device is known from EP-S-1192031. In the known device foil material is supplied to the foam dispensing station where the foaming substance is injected by the dispensing member into the inner space, delimited by the first and second side wall of the foil material. After injection of the foaming substance, the foil material with the foaming substance, present in the inner space thereof, is transported towards the welding station where closure welds are applied on the foil material. In the known device, the foaming substance falls on the first border which is sustained in order to avoid that the first border would be damaged during injection of the foaming substance and during the foaming reaction, pursuant the injection of the foaming substance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A drawback of the known device is that the means provided for sustaining the foil material renders the device somewhat more complex and thus more expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to build a device for manufacturing foam cushions, which is less complex to realise without however affecting the quality of the manufactured foam cushions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this purpose, a device according to the present invention is characterised in that said foam dispensing station further comprises slot shaping means mounted offset and downwards from said first retaining means, in such a manner as to form a slot to be crossed by an upper stroke of said foil material, said dispensing member being oriented with respect to said slot shaping means, when applied into said opening, in such a manner as to output said foaming substance towards an upper surface of said slot shaping means. The presence of the slot shaping means forces the foil material to cross the thus formed slot. The orientation of the foam dispensing member causes the ejected foaming substance to be output towards an upper surface of the slot shaping means. The narrow space of the slot causes the first and second side walls to be close to each other. Consequently, the foaming substance is somewhat hindered in its natural fall down movement. The fact that the foaming substance is output towards an upper surface of the slot shaping means causes the foaming substance to be spread open by the slot shaping means and fall down slowly like a curtain in an equally spaced manner. This spreading no longer imposes to sustain the first border since the thus obtained lower speed reduces the impact force. Moreover, as the foaming substance is spread, the foaming reaction takes place over a larger surface, thereby causing a better spreading out of the foams over the whole cushion surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said dispensing member is obliquely oriented with respect to said slot shaping means, when applied into said opening. The oblique orientation of the foam dispensing member contributes to the spreading out of the foam material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said transport means comprises a guiding and clamping unit, provided for guiding and clamping said second border after having crossed said slot shaping means. In such a manner, the foil material is supported when the foaming reaction occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably said slot shaping means comprises at least two rotationally driven brushes. The brushes not only enable to shape the slot but also, due to their rotational movement, to contribute to the transport of the foil material and the spread open of the foaming substance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said welding member comprises a welding head mounted on an arm, which can be displaced from and towards said second border, said arm being connected with a control unit provided for generating a series of pulses during said welding, said arm being provided for displacing said welding head from and towards said second border under control of said series of pulses. By moving the welding head during the welding operation, the latter is displaced towards and from the border to be welded, thereby enabling the foil material to temporarily cool down and reducing the risk that the foil material melts too much.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably said arm is adjusted in such a manner as to leave a gap between an extremity of said welding head and said second border during said welding. The presence of the gap prevents direct contact between the welding head and the foil material and reduces even more the danger that the foil material would melt.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A fourth preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said foam dispensing station comprises second retaining means provided to operate synchronously with said transport means, said retaining means being further provided for retaining said foil material when said pulling arm applies a pulling force on said foil material. By retaining the foil material when a pulling force is applied thereon, a tearing off of the foil material is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A fifth preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said dispensing member is provided to be displaced between a first position, situated within said inner space and a second position, situated at a head cleaning station. In such a manner the foam dispensing member can be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A sixth preferred embodiment of a device according to the invention is characterised in that said head cleaning station comprises a reservoir provided for storing a cleaning fluid, said reservoir being provided with a cover head, having a displaceable opening lid.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the drawings a same reference sign has been attributed to a same or analogous element.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The device <b>1</b> for manufacturing foam cushions, in particular for packaging purposes, according to the invention and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprises a foil supply station <b>2</b>, mounted upstream of a foam dispensing station <b>3</b>. Downstream of the foam dispensing station a welding station <b>4</b> is mounted. The latter comprises a vertical welding and cutting unit <b>14</b>, followed by a horizontal welding member <b>5</b>. The different stations are preferably mounted on a frame. However, the foil supply could be formed by a free standing station, which is not mounted on a common frame. A common frame has however the advantage to provide a certain rigidity to the complete device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The foil supply station <b>2</b> comprises a spindle <b>6</b> around which foil material <b>9</b> is winded The foil material has a first <b>9</b>-<b>1</b> and a second <b>9</b>-<b>2</b> wall joining each other at a common first border <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> and positioned so as to delimit an inner space accessible by an opening applied in a second border <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The second border is situated opposite to the first border. Preferably said first and second side wall of the foil material form a closed loop, which is for example obtained by extruding polyethylene. The advantage of using foil material forming a closed loop is that the guiding of the foil material towards the foam dispensing station can be realised more accurately. For this purpose, the foil supply station comprises a guiding member <b>25</b>, followed by a cutting member <b>26</b> mounted upstream of the foam dispensing station. The guiding member is preferably shaped as a pen and mounted in such a manner as to penetrate inside the closed loop, formed by the foil material. The guiding member <b>25</b> enters at the level of the second border <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>, supporting and guiding in such a manner the supplied foil material on its upper side where the second border is situated. The guiding member extends preferably over a length of 6 to 15 cm such as to give sufficient support and open the closed loop. The opening in the second border is formed by the cutting member <b>26</b>, formed for example by a small knife, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the foil supply station further comprises chicane shaping means <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> provided to impose a chicane path on the foil material. The chicane shaping means are placed between the spindle <b>6</b> and the guiding member <b>25</b> and are for example formed by two axes placed parallel to each other and along which the foil material is guided, in such a manner as to follow a chicane path instead of a linear path towards the foam dispensing member. The purpose of the chicane shaping means will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The foil material <b>9</b> is preferably provided with a series of bars <b>60</b> applied each time at an equal distance from each other. The bars are for example printed in black colour so as to be easily recognisable. The series of bars are for example applied on the outer side of the first side wall <b>9</b>-<b>1</b> and are used for speed control purpose, as will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Approximately at the transition between the foil material supply station and the foam dispensing station, there are mounted second retaining means <b>28</b> comprising two clamping bars <b>29</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>29</b>-<b>2</b> which are movable from and towards said foil material passing between the bars. The latter are for example pneumatically or hydraulically driven.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The foil supply station is provided for supplying the foil material to the foam dispensing station by unrolling the winded foil and transporting the latter via chicane shaping means <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> and the second retaining means <b>28</b> to first retaining means <b>8</b> of the foam dispensing station. Due to the fact that the foil material is winded on the spindle <b>6</b> it is rather easy to change the foil roll. Furthermore, different dimensions of the foil are possible because it is not necessary that the spindle around which the foil is winded extends over the whole height of the spindle axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second border <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> of the foil material, after having been cut open, if necessary, by the cutting member <b>26</b>, is kept open by the first retaining means <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). The latter are formed by a pair of clamps <b>8</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>2</b> applied face to face such as to form a substantially oval shaped opening. The opening thus formed in the foil material, enables a foam dispensing member <b>12</b> to enter into the volume delimited by the first and second wall <b>9</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>9</b>-<b>2</b> of the foil material. The foam dispensing member <b>12</b> is formed by a mixing gun enabling a mixture of the foaming agents before the foaming substance leaves the mixing gun. The foam dispensing member is mounted on a movable arm, provided to move the foam dispensing member not only in and out of the volume delimited by the foil material, but also along a path connecting a first position formed by the opening in the foil material and a second position situated at a head cleaning station <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the foam dispensing member <b>12</b> and the arm <b>10</b>, when situated in their first position, are obliquely oriented with respect to the plane where the second border is situated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foam dispensing station further comprises slot shaping means <b>19</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>2</b> mounted offset and downwards from the first retaining means. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slot shaping means preferably comprise at least two rotationally driven brushes and rotate in opposite direction from each other. The brushes are mounted on an axis driven by an electrical or pneumatic motor <b>27</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>2</b>. The brushes are mounted in such a manner that they form a slot to be crossed by an upper stroke of the foil material <b>9</b>. The slot shaping means are located underneath the output of the first retaining means <b>8</b> at a distance of 10 to 20 cm underneath the upper border of the first retaining means. The brushes are preferably made of a hard material in order to sufficiently grip on the foil material crossing the slot provided by the slot shaping means.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inclination of the foam dispensing member, when in the first position, is such, that the foam dispensing member is oriented with respect to the slot shaping means in such a manner as to output the foaming substance towards an upper surface of the slot shaping means <b>19</b>. The foam dispensing member is therefor put in the opening at the second border formed by the first retaining means <b>8</b> in such a manner that the output of the foam dispensing member faces the upper surface of the brushes forming the slot shaping means. By spraying the foaming substance towards an upper surface of the slot shaping means, the foaming substance can not directly fall towards the first border of the foil material as the latter is squeezed in the slot shaping means. Indeed, an upper part of the foil material i.e. at the second border <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> is kept open by the first retaining means <b>8</b> so that the foam dispensing member <b>12</b> can enter into the inner volume of the foil material. As the foaming substance falls on the upper surface of the slot shaping means, the rotation of the brushes helps to spread open the foaming substance. The foam dispensing member only enters over a short distance into this inner volume, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The distance at which the foam dispensing member enters this inner volume is less than the distance between the upper plane of the first retaining means <b>8</b> and the slot shaping means <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Due to the configuration of the first retaining means <b>8</b> and the slot shaping means <b>19</b>, the foil material forms as if to say a funnel extending between the first retaining means and the slot shaping means. This funnel enables to enter the foam dispensing member therein. Due to the orientation of the foam dispensing member, when inside the funnel, the foaming substance <b>28</b> reaches the exit of the narrow slot, formed by the slot shaping means. This narrow slot considerably limits the falling down, due to gravity, of the foaming substance, thereby causing a lengthwise spreading out of the injected foaming substance. In such a manner, the foaming substance is equally spread out over the transversal length of the foil material. The foaming substance will then react while slowly falling down in the inner volume of the foil material. A substantially equal filling of this inner volume is thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The foaming substance is preferably formed by a two component substance, which is mixed in the spray gun. However, it is also possible to use a granulate on a starch basis. In the latter case, the dispensing member comprises a supply duct for granulates and another duct for supplying a liquid, preferably water, which is atomised or sprayed over the supplied granulates. In such a manner, the supplied granulates are sucked in the sprayed or atomised liquid which stimulates their dispersion. The foil material is preferably made of a cellulose film in order to become an environmental friendly and degradable foam cushion. Polycaprolacton could also be used for the foil material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The welding and cutting station <b>4</b> comprise a vertical welding member <b>14</b>, having two welding heads. Between the welding heads there is provided a cutting tool formed either by a heated wire or a cutting knife. The welding member <b>14</b> extends vertically and serves to weld the lateral sides of the foam bag to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For this purpose, the first and second wall of the foil material are welded together in order to form a closed bag. The cutting tool applies a cut between both welds in order to separate the successive bags from each other. The welding members and the cutting tool can be controlled individually in order to enable the realisation of a chain of foam bags, simply by non cutting a set of successive bags.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Downstream of the vertical welding member <b>14</b>, transport means <b>17</b> are applied as well as a pulling arm <b>18</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. The transport means preferably comprises two toothed belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, which are mounted on wheels <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. Furthermore, a clamping unit <b>24</b>, comprising two parallel clamping beams <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, is mounted in the inner space delimited by the toothed belts. Preferably clamping beam <b>24</b>B is fixed, while clamping beam <b>24</b>A is movable mounted on cylinders <b>24</b>C and <b>24</b>D, which cylinders are pneumatically driven. The cylinders enable to displace the clamping beam <b>24</b>A towards and from the fixed clamping beam <b>24</b>B. In such a manner the clamping beams, when brought towards each other, retain the foil material near its second border when present inside the welding station, while the toothed belts move the foil material through the welding station. Instead of using pneumatic energy for moving the clamping beams, it is also possible to use hydraulic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a detailed view of the horizontal welding member <b>5</b>. The welding member <b>5</b> is mounted aside of the toothed belt <b>21</b> and connected with a control unit <b>30</b>, for example formed by a microprocessor provided with a memory. The welding member <b>5</b> preferably comprises a pneumatic cylinder <b>31</b> controlling a rod <b>32</b>. On this rod <b>32</b> a connection plate <b>33</b> is mounted which acts on an extremity of an arm <b>34</b>. The latter is mounted in a bracket <b>35</b>. Around the arm <b>34</b> a spring <b>36</b> is wrapped. On the other end of the arm <b>34</b> a welding head <b>37</b> is mounted. The welding head <b>37</b> points towards the second border of the foil material <b>9</b>. The pneumatic cylinder receives compressed air via a duct <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The control unit <b>30</b> is provided for generating a series of control pulses during the welding operation and for supplying the latter to the pneumatic cylinder <b>31</b>. The time period of each control pulse can be variable and is determined by the type of weld to be applied on the second border of the foil material. Each time when the pneumatic cylinder receives a control pulse, compressed air is supplied to the cylinder during the time period of the control pulse. Consequently the rod <b>32</b> will move in the direction of arrow A, thereby causing the plate <b>33</b> to loose contact with the extremity of the arm <b>34</b>. This causes on its turn that the plate <b>33</b> no longer exerts a pressure on the arm <b>34</b>, which causes the spring <b>36</b>, which was compressed, to move the arm <b>34</b> also in the direction of the arrow A. The welding head, which is mounted on the other extremity of the arm, is thereby removed from the foil material, thus causing the welding process to stop. In the meantime the foil material continues to be moved by means of the toothed belts, through the welding station. As the welding head is not in contact with the moving foil material, no horizontal welding is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As soon as the time period of the control pulse is over, the supply of compressed air stops causing the rod <b>32</b> to be pushed inside the cylinder (opposite direction of arrow A). Plate <b>36</b> is now again pushed against the arm <b>34</b>, which causes the spring <b>33</b> to be compressed and the welding head to be moved towards the foil material and thus the welding process to start again.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">By moving the welding head back and forward from the foil material the welding process is interrupted and restarted. This enables to apply a succession of welds and openings on the second border of the foil material. The openings are necessary to let escape the heat and the gas formed during the foaming process. Because the control unit determines the series of control pulses, a large possibility is offered to select the types of welds to be applied on the second border of the foil material. So it is possible to weld as if to say a dotted line of welds or to apply longer welds followed by shorter openings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The arm <b>34</b> is preferably provided with an adjustment mechanism <b>39</b>, for example formed by a bolt or a nut, in order to accurately adjust the distance between the foil material and the welding head. This arm is preferably adjusted in such a manner that between the extremity of the welding head and the foil material a gap is left so that the welding head does not physically contact the foil material. Preferably this gap is smaller than 0.5 mm. The welding is thus realised by heat radiation from the welding head towards the foil material. The advantage thereof is that the welding can be more accurately applied and that the probability that the foil material melts away completely due to the welding heat at the location where the weld is applied is substantially reduced. Moreover, the back and forward movement of the welding head gives the foil material some time to cool down at the location where the weld is applied, thus substantially reducing the probability that the foil material melts away.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiment the welding head <b>5</b> was only described for the application of the horizontal weld. It will however be clear that the vertical weld can also be applied by leaving openings between successive welds and thus by pulswise controlling the welding member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The operation of the welding members <b>5</b> and <b>14</b> and the operation of the clamping beams <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B are synchronised with each other. When the welding member <b>5</b> applies horizontal welds, the cylinders <b>24</b>C and <b>24</b>D apply a pressure on clamping beam <b>24</b>A, thereby keeping the clamping beams <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B in their closed position towards each other. The pressure is then also applied on the belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> and on the foil material present between the belts and the beams. So during the application of the horizontal weld the foil material is retained by the clamping beams and displaced by the belts. The pressure is also applied when the vertical weld is applied by means of the welding member <b>14</b>. After application of the vertical weld, the foil material is displaced away from welding member <b>14</b> by means of the belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> and this until the welded vertical border reaches the place where the welding member <b>5</b> is located. As this is only a short distance, since the welding member <b>5</b> is on the front side of the welding station, this displacement only takes a short time. Thereafter the pressure applied on clamping beam <b>24</b>A is removed, causing beam <b>24</b>A to move away from beam <b>24</b>B and to release the pressure applied on the foil material. As the foil material, with the foam forming the cushion, is thus no longer retained by the clamping beams, the cushion falls down by gravity. Preferably a cavity is provided to receive the cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> show a detailed view of the pulling arm <b>18</b>, which is part of transport means for transporting the film through the device. The pulling arm <b>18</b> comprises two jaws <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, which are each provided with a toothed profile <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. The jaws are each mounted on a bracket <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> connected with an axis <b>47</b> on which a control member <b>48</b>, for example formed by a pneumatic cylinder, is mounted. The jaws are connected with a mounting block <b>49</b>, which is mounted on axis <b>50</b> and driven by a further control member <b>51</b>, which is for example also formed by a pneumatic cylinder. The pulling arm is applied above the toothed belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the toothed profile of the jaws <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> a detector <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> is mounted. The detector is for example formed by electrical contact plates, which are part of an electric circuit. When no foil material would be present between the jaws and if the jaws would be moved towards each other, those contact plates would contact each other, thereby closing the electrical circuit. This could on its turn generate an alarm signal stopping the device. In the presence of foil material, the latter works as an insulator between the contact plates.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The further control member <b>51</b> takes care of the displacement in horizontal direction of the pulling arm. For this purpose the further control member pushes and pulls alternately on the mounting block <b>49</b> and the axes <b>50</b> slides through the block <b>52</b>. This movement takes care of the displacement of the pulling arm towards the front side of the foil material <b>9</b>. The jaws <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are thereby brought towards the foil material which is present at the extremity of the foam dispensing station. Because the axis <b>50</b> slide in the block, an adequate guiding of the puling arm is obtained. Once the foil material has been grasped by the jaws, the displacement of the pulling arm brings the foil material towards the toothed belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During the movement in horizontal direction towards the foil material present in the foam dispensing station, the jaws <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are open as showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This movement is for example controlled by the control unit which controls the supply of pressurised air to the further control member <b>51</b>. Once the jaws arrive at the level of the output of the foam dispensing station and are thus opposite the foil material, the horizontal movement is stopped. The control unit now controls the control member <b>48</b> by supplying pressurised air to the pneumatic cylinder. The latter will now exert a force on the brackets <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>. This causes them to be pushed away from each other. Because the brackets are connected with their respective jaws, which on their turn are mounted on the axes <b>47</b>, the movement of the brackets will cause a rotation of the jaws around the axes <b>47</b>, thereby causing the jaws to be moved towards each other. The toothed profiles <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, which are mounted on the jaws will thus be brought towards the foil material and the closing of the jaws will cause the clamping of the foil material by the toothed profiles. After the jaws have grasped the foil material, the control of the control unit <b>48</b> is stopped and the latter is maintained in its closed position in order to keep the jaws closed. The further control member <b>51</b> is thereafter again activated in order to move the mounting block <b>49</b> in the direction indicated by arrow B and thus to transport the foil material <b>9</b> from the foam dispensing station towards the toothed belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> so that the welding can take place at the welding station. After that the mounting block is brought back to its initial position, the control member <b>48</b> is again activated in order to release the pressure applied on the jaws and open the latter. The foil material is now retained by the clamping beams of the clamping unit <b>24</b> which have been moved towards the foil material once the pulling arm has pulled the foil material in the welding station. During the transport through the welding station, the foil material is welded by the welding member <b>5</b> along which the foil material is transported.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The device according to the invention further comprises a displacement detector <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) mounted for example on the same support <b>56</b> on which the slot shaping means <b>19</b> are mounted. The displacement detector is oriented towards the foil material <b>9</b> in such a manner as to read the series of bars <b>60</b> applied on the foil material. The displacement detector for example comprises a LED or a photocell provided for emitting light towards the foil material and catch the light reflected back by the foil material. So, each time a bar of the series of bars <b>60</b> passes along the displacement detector, the reflected light pattern is changed, which is detected by the displacement detector. The succession at which the reflected light pattern changes is an indication of the speed at which the foil material is transported through the device. The reflected light pattern signal is converted by the displacement detector into a control signal supplied to the control units <b>30</b> and <b>48</b>. The latter used this control signal to control the welding members and the clamping member and the pulling arm. The speed at which the foil material is moved through the foam dispensing station can vary, which enables to modify the filling degree of the inner volume and thus the dimension of the formed foam cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The pulling arm <b>18</b> co-operates with the second retaining means <b>28</b>, which are synchronised with the pulling arm. Besides moving the foil material from the foam dispensing station through the welding station, the pulling arm <b>18</b> also serves to tear off a foam bag from the remaining foil material, once the horizontal and vertical welds are applied on the foil material. Indeed, after having applied the horizontal welds by means of the welding member <b>5</b>, the vertical welds are applied by the welding member <b>14</b>. It could also be possible to apply the horizontal and vertical weld simultaneously. For this purpose however the welding member <b>5</b> should be moved along the second border instead of moving the second border along the welding member.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once the welds are applied and the cutting member of unit <b>14</b> has made a vertical cut in the foil material, the foam bag can be pulled away from the rest of the foil material. For this purpose, the pulling arm again grasps the second border of the foil material while the clamping beams <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B are synchronously moved towards the foil material. After the pulling arm has grasped the foil material and the latter is clamped between the beams <b>29</b>, the pulling arm applies a pull on the foil material thereby pulling off the formed foam bag. The fact that the foil material is clamped between the clamping beams of the second retaining means <b>28</b>, avoids that the pulling is exerted on the supplied foil material, thereby taking care that the supplied foil material is not damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The chicane shaping means <b>7</b> also contributes to avoid that the pulling force is applied over the supplied foil material. For this purpose, axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is rotably driven, for example by a pneumatic or hydraulic motor. Axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is driven when the vertical weld is applied. When axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is driven, the foil material is clamped by the retaining means <b>28</b> in order to avoid that the movement of the axis would cause a pulling on the foil material and pull the latter out of the welding station. During the application of the horizontal weld the axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is driven in order to supply foil material. After that the pulling arm <b>18</b> has grasped the foil material, the belts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> will transport the foil material while in the meantime the axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is driven for supplying the foil material. The axis <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is driven in such a manner that the foil material is somewhat loose in order to provide sufficient foil material and avoid tearing thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the device further comprises a head cleaning station <b>13</b> provided for cleaning the head <b>12</b> of the foam dispensing member. The head cleaning station comprises a reservoir <b>66</b> in which a cleaning fluid is stored. The reservoir is preferably formed by a removable cartridge, which enables an easy and environment friendly replacement, once the cleaning fluid is too polluted with foaming substance. The reservoir provided with a cover head <b>71</b> having a displaceable opening lid <b>67</b>. The lid <b>67</b> is slidably mounted between two guides <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> and activated by a motor <b>72</b>. Inside the reservoir there is a brush <b>70</b>. The reservoir is further provided with a detector for indicating the filling degree.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As already mentioned, the arm <b>10</b> on which the foam dispensing member is mounted is displaceable between the first position inside the foil material inner space and a second position situated at the head cleaning station. This displacement comprises a rotation which is only possible when the foam dispensing member is no longer inside the inner space of the foil material in order not to damage it. Once the foaming substance has been sprayed, the foam dispensing member is lifted out of this inner space and rotated towards the head cleaning station. When the foam dispensing member reaches the cleaning station, the motor <b>72</b> is activated in order to have the opening lid <b>67</b> sliding along the guides <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> and open the reservoir <b>66</b>. The head of the foam dispensing member is then entered into the reservoir and moved against brushes <b>70</b> in order to be cleaned. As the brushes are in a solvent fluid, the remaining foaming substance is removed from the head of the foam dispensing member. In such a manner an obstruction of the foam dispensing member is avoided. Preferably the brushes are driven by a motor <b>82</b>. After cleaning, the foam dispensing member is brought back to its first position and the opening lid <b>67</b> is again displaced in order to close the reservoir. In such a manner, the reservoir is only opened when the dispensing member is cleaned, thereby avoiding that the cleaning fluid would continuously evaporate and pollute the atmosphere.</p>
