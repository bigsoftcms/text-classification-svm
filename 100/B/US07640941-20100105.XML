<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A brush and roller cleaner includes a hollow canister to receive a spray wand. A control knob pivots with respect to the canister to direct pressurized liquid from apertures of the spray wand. A top cap assembly mates with the canister in one of two positions, 180 degrees offset from one another. The top cap assembly has a tool holding assembly that is capable of holding a paint tool or roller. The tool holding assembly rotates in response to the liquid output from the spray wand apertures. The top cap assembly is capable of holding a roller in a first or second position. The roller rotates within the canister in response to the liquid output from the spray wand apertures to clean the roller cover. A handle for the cleaner supports a roller frame clip for holding the roller in a first or second position.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to painting tool cleaners. More particularly, the present invention relates to brush and roller cleaners that operate under the power of water pressure supplied from a household water supply.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Paint is a general term for a family of products used to protect and/or add color to an object or surface by way of a pigmented or non-pigmented coating. Paint is very common and is applied to almost every kind of object. In particular, paint is regularly provided to a variety of interior household painting surfaces such as walls, ceilings, trim surfaces, and flooring, as well as exterior surfaces such as siding, clapboards, and decking. Paint is also regularly applied by professionals and lesser experienced individuals to a variety of consumer and non-consumer articles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Paint is generally formed from three components: binder, diluent and additives. The binder eventually solidifies to form a dried paint film. The diluent is volatile and serves to adjust the viscosity of the paint, but does not become part of the dried paint film. Other components found in paint, such as pigments, are generally known as additives. A single paint component may serve dual purposes, such as both binder and pigment. Typical binders include synthetic or natural resins such as acrylics, polyurethanes, polyesters, melamines, oils, or latex. Likewise typical diluents include organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones, esters, glycol ethers, and the like. Water is a common diluent. Various additives that are included within a paint mixture include pigments, dyes, catalysts, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, texturizers, adhesion promotors, flatteners (de-glossing agents), and the like. After application, the paint solidifies and becomes tack-free.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Paint may impregnate or partially impregnate a surface. As set forth herein, paint includes the general paint mixtures set forth above, as well as other surface coatings such as stains, varnishes, lacquers, dyes, colored glues, oils, waxes, shellacs, glazes, inks, and finishes. Further, as set forth herein, paint may be virtually pigment free, and may be used as a clear protective finish or general protectant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional manual painting tools include handled application tools, such as brushes, sponges, blades and the like. Handled application tools are available in various sizes and shapes. Paint brushes traditionally have a plurality of bristles permanently attached to a rigid or semi-rigid handle. The bristles may be formed from a natural material that is partially absorbent, such as horse hair. The bristles may also be formed from a synthetic material, such as nylon, which is not partially absorbent. The number of bristles generally determines the amount of paint that may be transferred with each application or painting stroke. Likewise, the size the associated brush handle is generally, but not necessarily, determined by the number of bristles. Paint brushes are generally cleaned and reused after use. Natural bristle paint brushes, especially higher-quality horse hair brushes, are generally cleaned and hung by the handle so that the bristles dry in a uniform, generally straight, elongated shape.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rollers are manual painting tools for applying paint or similar liquid substances, and generally include a cylindrical pad, also known as a roller cover, which is removably attached to a rotatable roller cage and a roller frame. Paint rollers are generally 9&#x2033; to 9.5&#x2033; in width, however smaller rollers, also known as brayers, are generally used for decorative or trim painting. The roller cage is generally convex toward the center to hold the roller cover thereon. The cage generally rotates about an angular wire shaft (also known as a roller frame) by way of a bearing, and a handle is attached to the wire shaft. As the roller cover is manually engaged with a painting surface, friction contact induces the cage to rotate, and thereby apply a layer of paint. The roller cover thickness is called a &#x201c;nap,&#x201d; which varies in thickness for the particular application. For example, a &#xbc;&#x2033; nap applies a thinner layer of paint and is generally used for flat surfaces. A &#x215c;&#x2033; nap or 1&#x2033; nap applies a thicker layer of paint, and is generally suitable for covering surface irregularities, or rougher surfaces, such as concrete blocks or stucco walls. The nap may also include a pattern to provide a decorative design. The nap may be formed from a partially absorbent material, such as wool, or a non-absorbent material, such as rubber or nylon. The roller cover is generally cleaned during use, such as when switching colors or when taking a break from painting. The roller cover is also cleaned to reduce the amount of mess before manual removal from the roller cage. The roller cover may also be completely removed from the roller cage for cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there remains a need for a painting tool cleaner that may easily and expeditiously remove paint from a paint tool. There also remains a need for a painting tool cleaner that may be powered by a household water supply to agitate and remove paint from the tool.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference now to the figures, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a preferred embodiment of a tool cleaner <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In particular the tool cleaner <b>100</b> is illustrated to include canister <b>102</b>, to which a top cap assembly <b>104</b>, spray wand assembly <b>106</b> and handle assembly <b>108</b> are connected. The top cap assembly <b>104</b> is removably and reversibly engaged with the top of canister <b>102</b>, and is configured to secure a handled application tool or roller. Spray wand assembly <b>106</b> includes supply hose <b>110</b>, control knob <b>111</b> and spray wand <b>112</b>. When supply hose <b>110</b> is attached to a household water supply, streams of liquid water are directed outward from spray wand <b>112</b> to thereby clean the enclosed tool or roller. Control knob <b>111</b> is connected to a top portion of spray wand <b>112</b> and manually pivots to laterally direct the liquid streams of water across the enclosed tool or roller. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the control knob <b>111</b> may sequentially pivot in a back and forth manner, i.e. pendulate, under control of an operator to thereby direct pressurized liquid streams <b>114</b> from the plurality of apertures <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> toward the roller or handled application tool held within the tool cleaner <b>100</b>. The force of the liquid streams hitting the tool or roller induces rotation, which thereby assists with cleaning. Canister <b>102</b> is generally frusto-conical in shape such that the base diameter is greater than the top diameter. The bottom of canister <b>102</b> is open to facilitate egress of liquid and removed paint through the bottom thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The top cap assembly <b>104</b> sits onto canister <b>102</b> in one of two positions, 180 degrees offset from one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates top cap assembly <b>104</b> in a first position for cleaning a roller (not shown). This is also known as roller cleaning mode. Thin rib <b>105</b> is integrally formed with canister <b>102</b> and includes an interior ridge <b>107</b> that is positioned towards the front of canister <b>102</b>. If top cap assembly has a brush loaded into tool holder assembly <b>122</b> or if a roller cover is loaded around tool holder assembly <b>122</b>, the thin rib <b>105</b> resists insertion into canister <b>102</b>. According to a preferred embodiment, thin rib <b>105</b> actually prevents insertion of a loaded tool holder assembly <b>122</b> when the top cap assembly <b>104</b> is positioned according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The user is then reminded to flip top cap assembly 180 degrees (see position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), thereby placing the loaded tool holder assembly <b>122</b> closer to spray wand <b>112</b>. The illustrated position of top cap assembly <b>104</b> is the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for cleaning a roller cover that is still attached to a roller frame. According to embodiments of the present invention, canister <b>102</b> may be opaque, translucent, or transparent. According to a preferred embodiment, canister <b>102</b> is translucent so that a user may visually inspect the tool or roller during cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the tool cleaner <b>100</b> illustrating cleaning of a handled application tool <b>120</b> in the form of a brush. Tool <b>120</b> is releasably held within canister <b>102</b> by way of tool holder assembly <b>122</b>, described in greater detail below. Tool holder assembly <b>122</b> is rotationally connected to top cap assembly <b>104</b> and freely rotates within canister <b>102</b>. Tool holder assembly <b>122</b> provides a dual purpose. First, a plurality of pivotal arms (described in greater detail below) is configured to releasably hold a tool, such as a paint brush there between. Second, a soiled roller cover may be removed from a roller frame and disposed about the outer periphery of tool holder assembly <b>122</b> for cleaning. Streams of liquid are output from a plurality of apertures <b>124</b> within spray wand <b>112</b>. According to a preferred embodiment, and described in greater detail below, apertures <b>124</b> are fan jets that produce liquid streams that radiate at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of spray wand <b>112</b>. The fan jets streams are also narrow in the perpendicular direction to spray wand <b>112</b>, and thereby have a fan-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During operation, the liquid streams <b>114</b> output from spray wand <b>112</b> penetrate the paint holding material <b>128</b> in handled application tool <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, tool <b>120</b> is a brush and paint holding material <b>128</b> is a plurality of bristles. Likewise, the liquid streams <b>114</b> direct paint off from non-paint holding surfaces, such as handle <b>130</b>. The resulting liquid mixture then exits through the open bottom <b>103</b> of canister <b>102</b>. If the tool <b>120</b> directly faces or is angularly perpendicular to the spray wand <b>112</b>, no rotation in tool <b>120</b> will be produced. However, if the user manually rotates control knob <b>111</b> away from the center of tool <b>120</b>, rotation will be induced, thereby assisting in separation of paint from the tool. The speed of rotation is generally proportional to the distance of liquid streams <b>114</b> from the center of tool <b>120</b>. Accordingly, a faster rotation is produced and greater paint separation is achieved as the water streams are directed towards the edges of tool <b>120</b>. Additional separation may be achieved as the user manually rotates the direction of the water streams against the direction of tool rotation by way of control knob <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to an alternate embodiment, hose <b>110</b> is connected to a pressurized water supply to thereby provide a greater liquid force from spray wand <b>112</b>. According to another alternate embodiment, the liquid supplied to tool cleaner <b>100</b> by way of supply hose <b>110</b> is a combination of liquid, such as water, and a paint removing agent, such as detergent or paint thinner. According to another alternate embodiment, the bottom of canister <b>102</b> is closed such that a roller or handled application tool may soak in the liquid within canister <b>102</b>. The liquid may be water, paint thinner, or a combination of water and an additive such as detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of tool cleaner <b>100</b> illustrating cleaning of a roller <b>140</b>, in the form of a paint roller. As illustrated, the top cap assembly <b>104</b> has been rotated 180 degrees from the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> while the cleaning operation provided by spray wand <b>112</b> is similar as set forth above. In this configuration, the roller cover <b>144</b> remains attached to roller frame <b>142</b> during cleaning. During operation, the liquid streams <b>114</b> output from spray wand <b>112</b> penetrate the paint holding material in roller cover <b>144</b> of roller <b>140</b>. Likewise, the liquid streams <b>114</b> direct paint off from non-paint holding surfaces, such as a portion of roller frame <b>142</b> that is disposed inside canister <b>102</b>. The resulting liquid-paint mixture then exists through the open bottom <b>103</b> of canister <b>102</b>. Roller cover <b>144</b> is generally cylindrical and generally rotates within canister <b>102</b> with respect to roller frame <b>142</b>. If the spray wand <b>112</b> directly faces roller cover <b>144</b>, no rotation is produced. However, if the user manually rotates control knob <b>111</b> away from the center of roller cover <b>144</b>, rotation thereof will be induced, thereby assisting in separation of paint from the roller. Unlike rotation of application tool <b>120</b>, which is provided by rotation of tool holder assembly <b>122</b>, roller cover <b>144</b> rotates with respect to a bearing within roller <b>140</b>. The speed of rotation is generally proportional to the distance of the water streams from the center of roller cover <b>144</b>. Accordingly, a faster rotation is produced and greater paint separation is achieved as the water streams are directed towards the edges of roller cover <b>144</b>. Additional separation may be achieved as the user manually rotates the direction of the water streams against the direction of roller rotation by way of control knob <b>111</b>. Roller <b>140</b> is held in place through contact between top cap assembly <b>104</b> and the top of canister <b>102</b>. Roller frame <b>142</b> is further restrained from movement by way of roller frame clip <b>146</b>. Accordingly, cleaning of roller <b>140</b> is provided without the necessity of the user holding onto roller <b>140</b> or roller handle <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the top of canister <b>102</b> illustrating connection of spray wand assembly <b>106</b>, handle assembly <b>108</b> and insertion of tool holder assembly <b>122</b> from top cap assembly <b>104</b>. Canister <b>102</b> defines a top surface <b>150</b> and a peripheral recess <b>152</b> extending around front and side portions of top surface <b>150</b>. A side surface <b>154</b> of peripheral recess <b>152</b> extends downwardly from top surface <b>150</b> and terminates in bottom ridge <b>156</b>. In turn, bottom ridge <b>156</b> connects with the top of the outer side surface of canister <b>102</b>. A pair of alternately disposed molded lugs <b>158</b> protrudes from the face of side surface <b>154</b>. Molded protrusion <b>162</b> also extends from the side surface <b>154</b> and defines a molded channel <b>164</b> therein. Molded protrusion <b>162</b> and channel <b>164</b> releasably lock molded handle <b>166</b> into a closed position within peripheral recess <b>152</b>. According to an alternate embodiment, a second molded protrusion and channel are formed in peripheral recess <b>152</b> opposite the first protrusion <b>164</b> and channel <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Handle assembly <b>108</b> is configured and arranged to be received within peripheral recess <b>152</b> about the top of canister <b>102</b>. Handle assembly <b>108</b> includes molded handle <b>166</b> having a pair of integrally molded snap rivets <b>168</b>. A roller frame clip <b>146</b> is slidably received about handle <b>166</b>. Snap rivets <b>168</b> integrally protrude inwardly from handle <b>166</b> for connection into corresponding molded lugs <b>158</b>, and respectively define axes of rotation for molded handle <b>166</b>. The roller frame clip <b>146</b>, described in greater detail below, is clipped onto handle <b>166</b>. When handle <b>166</b> is in the closed position within peripheral recess <b>152</b>, the roller frame clip <b>146</b> is held in place through engagement with handle <b>166</b>. In particular, clip <b>146</b> engages a first plurality of bulbous protrusions <b>167</b> formed on the outside of handle <b>166</b>. A second plurality of bulbous protrusions (not shown) is formed on the outside of handle <b>166</b> opposite from the first plurality to engage roller frame clip <b>146</b> when the roller <b>140</b> is inserted in a left-handed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The roller frame clip <b>146</b> is user adjusted along the range of bulbous oblong protrusions <b>167</b> on molded handle <b>166</b>. In this embodiment, the protrusions <b>167</b> span approximately 2&#x2033; along handle <b>166</b> to facilitate user optimization of roller frame position. It is known that roller frames are provided in a variety of forms that vary dimensionally. A roller frame that has a larger angled dimension from the roller cover will protrude a greater distance outwardly from the canister <b>102</b>. In this case, by varying the position of the roller frame clip <b>146</b> along handle <b>166</b>, a larger roller frame is accommodated. The user makes this adjustment to the roller frame clip <b>146</b> and then releases to allow the roller frame clip to be affixed in place. As noted above, a second set of oblong bulbous protrusions (not shown) are provided in a second position on the other side of handle <b>166</b> for user operation in a left-hand configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The molded handle <b>166</b> further defines an interior ridge <b>172</b> that protrudes inwardly toward canister <b>102</b>. When in the closed position, molded handle <b>166</b> rests within peripheral recess <b>152</b> and ridge <b>172</b> is snapped into channel <b>164</b> of molded protrusion <b>162</b>. Handle <b>166</b> is rotatable into the open position about snap rivets <b>168</b> to facilitate carrying of tool cleaner <b>100</b> to a work location by the user. Handle <b>166</b> also allows the tool cleaner <b>100</b> to be hung on a wall as a method of storage.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Top canister opening <b>174</b> is defined in the top surface <b>150</b> of canister <b>102</b>, and is configured and arranged to receive tool holder assembly <b>122</b> of top cap assembly <b>104</b>. A curved frontal bead <b>176</b> protrudes upwardly from top surface <b>150</b> about a front portion and side portions of top canister opening <b>174</b>. A frontal interior ridge <b>177</b> is defined within a frontal section of canister opening <b>174</b> to mate with a corresponding channel in top cap assembly <b>104</b>. A curved rearward bead <b>178</b> protrudes upwardly from top surface <b>150</b> about a rear portion of opening <b>174</b>. A rearward interior ridge <b>179</b> is defined within a rearward section of canister opening <b>174</b> to mate with a corresponding channel in top cap assembly <b>104</b>. Frontal bead <b>176</b> and rearward bead <b>178</b> are configured to engage a peripheral edge of top cap assembly <b>104</b> (not shown) when installed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated, frontal bead <b>176</b> and rearward bead <b>178</b> define a pair of passages for alternately receiving roller frame <b>142</b>. The top surface <b>150</b> further defines first recess <b>180</b> and second recess <b>182</b>, respectively, within each of the defined passages. First recess <b>180</b> receives a first flexible bottom section <b>181</b> and second recess <b>182</b> receives a second flexible bottom section <b>183</b>. Bottom sections <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> are configured to flexibly deform when roller frame <b>142</b> is placed thereon. Roller frame <b>142</b> may be selectively held in at least one of two positions between top cap assembly <b>104</b> and top surface <b>150</b>. In a right-hand configuration, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, roller frame <b>142</b> is held between top cap assembly <b>104</b> and top surface <b>150</b> by first flexible bottom section <b>181</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and first flexible top section <b>254</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The user may then direct spray wand <b>112</b> by manipulating control knob <b>111</b> with the right hand. In a left-hand configuration (not shown), the roller frame <b>142</b> is held between top cap assembly <b>104</b> and top surface <b>150</b> by second flexible bottom section <b>183</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and second flexible top section <b>256</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The user may then direct spray wand <b>112</b> by manipulating control knob <b>111</b> with the left hand.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the absence of a roller frame, bottom sections <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> mate with corresponding sections <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) within top cap assembly <b>104</b> to thereby provide a liquid seal. Bottom sections <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> may be made from a material that is affixable to canister <b>102</b> within the respective furrow with a suitable adhesive. According to a preferred embodiment, bottom sections <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> are adhesive backed micro cellular polyurethane, wherein the mating is provided by an adhesive bond. According to the illustrated embodiment, the spacing between frontal bead <b>176</b> and rearward bead <b>178</b>, above bottom sections <b>181</b>, <b>183</b>, is symmetrical. Differently sized and/or oriented roller frames are accommodated by tool cleaner <b>100</b> by repositioning roller frame clip <b>146</b> about handle assembly <b>108</b>. According to an alternate embodiment, the spacing between frontal bead <b>176</b> and rearward bead <b>178</b>, above bottom sections <b>181</b>, <b>183</b>, is not symmetrical to accommodate differently sized and/or differently oriented roller frames.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Spray wand opening <b>184</b> is defined in a rearward section of top surface <b>150</b> of canister <b>102</b>, and is configured and arranged to receive spray wand <b>112</b> of spray wand assembly <b>106</b> therein. Peripheral bead <b>186</b> protrudes upwardly around spray wand opening <b>184</b>. Peripheral bead <b>186</b> includes a pair of C-shaped projections <b>188</b> that extend peripherally toward the sides of canister <b>102</b>. The C-shaped projections <b>188</b> are respectively received within side protrusions <b>190</b> of control knob <b>111</b>. The C-shaped projections <b>188</b> limit free rotation of control knob <b>111</b> about peripheral bead <b>186</b>. Accordingly, control knob <b>111</b> is confined to back and forth pivotal motion with respect to top cap assembly <b>104</b>, and thereby facilitates user control of the water stream exiting from spray wand <b>112</b> toward the tool or roller disposed within canister <b>102</b>.</p>
