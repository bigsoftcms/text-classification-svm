<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">There are many different types of cleaning devices and tools which are used to clean counters, walls, floors and other surfaces. Some cleaning devices are handheld devices, such as scrub brushes and the like which are held in a user's hand and moved across a surface to remove and clean the surface. Other cleaning devices include handles which enable the user to extend the cleaning device to places spaced from the user. Such handles also enable a user to be able to stand while cleaning, such as the handles on most brooms, dust sweepers and mops.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In particular, brooms, dust sweepers and mops have elongated handles. These handles are typically made out of wood, steel or some other durable material which enables the user to hold the cleaning device and maneuver it along the floor, wall or other similar surface to clean those surfaces. Such handles, however, make cleaning under items such as couches and coffee tables, difficult, because the user has to bend down or significantly lower the handle of the cleaning device to be able to extend the cleaning end of the device under the item. This makes cleaning floors and other surfaces that underlie these items difficult. Additionally, a user typically has to bend his or her body, crouch down closer to the floor, or both, to be able to maneuver the end of the cleaning device under such items. This adds stress to the user's body as well as making such work burdensome, difficult and tiring.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to provide handles with sections which can pivot relative to each other, but typically such handles can pivot about one axis or use as a pivot joint, a coil spring which lacks rigidity and impairs control.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved handle for a cleaning device that overcomes the above problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment provides a cleaning device including a cleaning member and a handle connected to the cleaning member. The handle includes a first member and a second member. The first member includes a ball member and the second member includes a socket. The ball member is disposed in the socket to couple the first member and the second member and enable the second member to pivot with respect to the first member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, the socket includes a plurality of fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the fingers are made of at least one of: a flexible material and a rigid material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the socket includes a slot having a ball-shaped upper portion and a elongated lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the cleaning device includes a first connector including the socket and a second connector including the ball member. The first connector is removably connected to the first member and the second connector is removably connected to the second member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, at least one of the first and second members includes a cavity, where at least one of the first connector and the second connector includes ridges which frictionally engage an inside surface of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the first member includes a grip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the cleaning member is at least one of: a brush, a dust mop and a mop.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment provides a cleaning device including a cleaning member and a handle connected to the cleaning member. The handle includes a first member and a second member. The first member includes a ball member and the second member includes a socket. The ball member is disposed in the socket to couple the first member and the second member and enable the second member to pivot with respect to the first member. The cleaning device also includes a sleeve slidably connected to the handle and movable between a first position, which allows the second member to pivot, and a second position, which does not allow the second member to pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the second member includes a prong-shaped collar and the sleeve defines a prong-shaped end, where the prong-shaped end of the sleeve engages the prong-shaped collar when the sleeve is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the sleeve includes an actuator, which when activated, releases the sleeve from one of the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the cleaning device includes a first connector that includes the socket and a second connector that includes the ball member. The first connector is removably connected to the first member and the second connector is removably connected to the second member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, at least one of the first and second members includes a cavity, where at least one of the first connector and the second connector includes ridges which frictionally engage an inside surface of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the cleaning member is at least one of: a brush, a dust mop and a mop.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further embodiment provides a cleaning device including a cleaning member and a handle connected to the cleaning member. The handle includes a first member and a second member. The first member defines a socket and the second member defines an opening.

To couple the top and bottom members together, the ball member <b>142</b> is disposed in the rounded top opening <b>143</b>. The second member <b>106</b> is moved downwardly so that the shaft <b>140</b> moves downward through the slot opening <b>145</b> until the ball member <b>143</b> is in socket <b>139</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another alternative embodiment, the pivot member or pivot post <b>130</b> is moved downwardly through an opening extending the length of the first member until the ball member <b>142</b> is in the socket <b>139</b> and the shaft <b>140</b> extends from the socket. The threaded end of the pivot post <b>130</b> is then secured in an opening <b>145</b> defined by the top of second member as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A sleeve <b>114</b> is slidably connected to at least one of the first and second members of <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, the sleeve <b>114</b> is slidably connected to the first member and slides or moves between a first, open or pivoting position, and a second, closed or non-pivoting position. In the first or open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, sleeve <b>114</b> is moved along the first member <b>104</b> and away from the pivot joint or pivot assembly <b>108</b>, so that the first connector can pivot with respect to the second connector. In the first or open position, the first and second members <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are able to pivot with respect to each other and enable the user to clean hard to reach places on a floor and other surfaces. During pivoting the post <b>140</b> moves into a slot between adjacent fingers <b>138</b>. There are plural slots providing plural pivot axes, the number of which is determined by the number of fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, if a user wants the handle <b>102</b> to be straight and non-pivoting, the user grasps the sleeve <b>114</b> and slides it toward the cleaning member <b>116</b> until the sleeve <b>114</b> at least partially covers the first and second connectors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in an embodiment, the sleeve <b>114</b> completely surrounds or covers the pivot assembly <b>108</b> and prevents the first and second members <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> from pivoting with respect to each other. The sleeve <b>114</b>, therefore, is moved between the first or open position where the first and second members <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> can pivot with respect to each other and the closed or non-pivoting position which prevents the handle <b>102</b> from pivoting at the pivot joint or pivot assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The cleaner <b>100</b>, and more specifically, the handle <b>102</b>, also includes a grip <b>126</b>, made of an elastomeric material or other suitable material, that defines an opening <b>128</b>. The opening enables a user to be able to insert a hook or other device though the opening to hang the cleaner for storage.
