<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a support for wiper drives of windshield wiper systems, in particular to clean front and rear windows of vehicles. The windshield wiper systems comprise electric motors, which drive a uniform-transmission gear, to which a uniform-transmission gear such as a crank-and-rocker linkage or the like can be subordinated as a coupling element to a wiper arm or a wiper lever. The electric motor and the uniform-transmission gear are connected to the body of a vehicle by means of a diecast part or bent sheet metal part.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject of DE 196 42 666 A1 is a support for drive shafts of a windshield wiper system. A wiper system includes a tubular mounting plate, which features at least one tubular element to support drive shafts. A bearing bush is built into this tubular element. The bearing bush is fixed in positive engagement vis-&#xe0;-vis the tubular element. The bearing bush has at least one collar. The tubular element includes an inner contour deviating from a circular shape that is polygon-shaped or noncircular in particular, while the bearing bush features an outer contour matching this inner contour. The contour between the bearing bush and the tubular element can also be embodied running conically in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE 197 12 113 A1 deals with the support of a wiper drive. A wiper system for a vehicle includes a wiper motor and a gear, which is fastened with fastening areas formed on its housing to a tubular support via a receptacle. The receptacle encircles the tubular support in positive engagement and/or adherently. The tubular support features a noncircular shape in the circumferential direction and/or a changing contour, dimension or alignment in the longitudinal direction. The receptacle represents a very complex component and is completely or partially formed on the gear housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A linking of a wiper drive to a vehicle body that can be executed in a standardized manner can be achieved with the attainment proposed in accordance with the invention. To do this, linking points are provided in the wiper drive, which are comprised of a drive motor and a gear, either in the housing of the drive motor or on the gear housing, and these linking points are not directly connected to the drive motor or the gear, but are arranged on the drive motor or the gear via decoupling elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The linking points provided with decoupling elements can also be connected directly both to the vehicle body beneath the windshield or to the vehicle body beneath a rigid, upright rear window. In addition, the wiper drive, comprised of the drive motor and the gear, can be accommodated on a holding plate via the wiper drive's linking points that are provided with decoupling elements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When directly linking the wiper drive to the body of a vehicle, a screw-down surface with a hole pattern suitable for accommodating the wiper drive can already be provided there. As a result, a separate fastening element can be dispensed with. When fastening the wiper drive to a holding plate, which is connected to the body of a vehicle, the holding plate serves as a holder for the wiper drive. The holding plate can be adapted in an advantageous manner to the geometry of the installation space required to accommodate the wiper drive and features a hole pattern suitable for accommodating the wiper drive. No separately supplied decoupling elements are required on the holding plate for the wiper drive. Decoupling the wiper drive from the vehicle body with respect to the transmission of noises and vibrations originating from the wiper motor or from the gear, is accomplished via the linking points provided with decoupling elements that are executed on the linking points to the body or the holding plate on the wiper drive&#x2014;whether on the housing of the drive motor or on the housing of the gear.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The attainment proposed in accordance with the invention makes it possible to standardize the linking of a wiper drive to a vehicle body. In addition, the type variety of the to-be-supplied decoupling elements can be considerably reduced with the attainment proposed in accordance with the invention. It is simpler and more cost effective to make use of decoupling elements that have already been used and proven. A reduction in the parts of a wiper system can be achieved by eliminating a motor holder in accordance with the first of the above mentioned installation variations. In addition, the joining process of the wiper drive is simplified considerably in the case of wall mounting at the vehicle manufacturer. The worker can grasp the wiper motor with one hand, while with his other hand he screws the wiper drive on the screw-down surface or on the holding plate from above using a suitable standard tool. In addition, with respect to assembly of the wiper drives embodied in accordance with the invention, the decoupling elements and the fastening elements, such as threaded bushings, can already be connected during assembly to the wiper housing or the gear housing of the wiper drive. This allows the variety of to-be-supplied individual parts that are required during assembly of the wiper drive to be reduced considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment of the wiper drive proposed in accordance with the invention consists of connecting the wiper drive motor with the vehicle body via two decoupling elements, which are fastened on the gear housing of the gear allocated to the wiper drive motor and on the pole pot end of the wiper drive motor. The decoupling element provided on the pole pot end of the wiper drive motor can optionally be integrated directly into the vehicle body or be arranged on a motor holder. This embodiment of the wiper drive proposed in accordance with the invention offers the advantage that the connection of the wiper drive, comprised of a wiper drive motor and a gear, can be fastened on its receptacles on the vehicle body as far as possible away from the output shaft of the gear so that the wiper drive can absorb greater forces or torques occurring when wiping the front or rear window. The wiper drive proposed in accordance with the invention is suited for realizing a wiper direct drive, in which a nonuniform-transmission gear is eliminated and the structure of the wiper system features a drive motor, a uniform-transmission gear that is allocated to it (components of the wiper drive) and a wiper arm, dispensing with a wiper linkage. The shaft accommodating the wiper arm can be driven directly with the output shaft of the uniform-transmission gear. In addition, reversing electronics to reverse the wiper drive motor when it reaches its end positions as well as position sensor technology can be allocated to the wiper drive motor of the wiper drive.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment of the attainment proposed in accordance with the invention, a first linking point <b>31</b> on which a first decoupling element <b>41</b> is arranged can be provided laterally on the housing of the wiper motor <b>2</b> in the area of the pole pot end <b>10</b>. A second linking point <b>32</b> with a further, second decoupling element <b>42</b> can be provided opposite from this on a lateral surface of the gear housing <b>7</b> of the uniform-transmission gear. The decoupling element <b>41</b> allocated to the pole pot end <b>10</b> is either directly mounted in the vehicle body or mounted on a motor holder (not shown here). This embodiment achieves in an advantageous manner that the connection of the wiper motor <b>2</b> to its fastening elements, i.e., to the first linking point <b>31</b> and the second linking point <b>32</b> (both indicated by dashed lines), is arranged as far as possible away from the output shaft <b>5</b> of the uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> so that higher forces or higher torques can be absorbed or transmitted via the wiper drive <b>1</b> in accordance with the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, in an enlarged scale, a decoupling element to decouple a wiper drive <b>1</b> from a vehicle body or a holding plate connected with it. The depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a section of a housing <b>7</b> of a uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b>, whereby a recess <b>46</b> is arranged in it. A part of the holding plate <b>40</b>, which can be connected to a part of a vehicle body not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is shown above the housing <b>7</b> of the uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b>. A first decoupling element <b>41</b>, a second decoupling element <b>42</b> as well as a third decoupling element <b>43</b> can be embodied as bushings <b>48</b> in accordance with the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A revolving annual groove <b>49</b> is embodied on the outer circumferential surface of the bushings <b>48</b>. A ring surface <b>50</b>, which delimits the recess <b>46</b> within the gear housing <b>7</b> of the wiper drive <b>1</b>, engages in this revolving annular groove <b>49</b> of the bushing <b>48</b>. The bushing <b>48</b> includes a first fore part <b>53</b> projecting into the recess <b>46</b> and a second fore part <b>54</b> assigned to the holding plate <b>40</b> for connecting with the vehicle body <b>24</b>. The bushings <b>48</b> that can be used as decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, which can be constituted of a plastic material or a vibration-absorbing elastomer, are provided with a first fastening element <b>55</b> in the form of a threaded bushing. The threaded bushing <b>55</b> includes a bushing head <b>56</b>, which, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is adjacent to first fore part <b>53</b> of the bushing <b>48</b> within the recess <b>46</b>. In addition, the threaded bushing <b>55</b> features a sleeve-like projection, which is surrounded by a bore hole wall (embodied in the diameter <b>61</b>) of the bushing <b>48</b> used as decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>. The sleeve-like projection on the threaded bushing <b>55</b>, which is provided with an internal screw thread, is embodied in an inside diameter <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The threaded bushing <b>55</b> is slid into the bore hole of the bushing <b>48</b> before mounting the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> that can be embodied as bushings <b>48</b> in the gear housing <b>7</b>. Then the bushing <b>48</b> is mounted on the ring surface <b>50</b> of the gear housing <b>7</b>. Finally, the gear housing <b>7</b> of the wiper drive <b>1</b>, which in the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> accommodates the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, is positioned beneath the holding plate <b>40</b>. By inserting a fastening element <b>57</b>, which can be embodied as a screw, a connection can be produced between the fastening element <b>57</b> and the threaded bushing <b>55</b> surrounded by the bushing <b>48</b> using a standard tool. After tightening the screwed connection <b>60</b>, the head <b>58</b> of the fastening element <b>57</b> lies on an upper side <b>59</b> of the holding plate <b>40</b>. As a result of the screwed connection <b>60</b>, the threaded bushing <b>55</b> and the fastening element <b>57</b> are braced adherently against one another, whereby the gear housing <b>7</b> of the wiper drive <b>1</b> is fastened on the holding plate <b>40</b>, which for its part is accommodated on a body part of a vehicle body (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The recesses <b>46</b> for accommodating the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> on a gear housing <b>7</b> are depicted embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> could, of course, also be set into the housing of the wiper motor without coming into direct contract with the wiper motor. By connecting the wiper drive <b>1</b>, which is embodied as a wiper direct drive <b>30</b>, either directly on the vehicle body <b>24</b> or on a holding plate <b>40</b> depicted in the figure, a linking of the wiper drive <b>1</b> to the vehicle body or on the holding plate <b>40</b> is accomplished in such a way that the noises or vibrations originating from the wiper drive <b>1</b> cannot be transmitted to the vehicle body (see depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If the bushings <b>48</b> used as decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are manufactured of a plastic material or an elastomer, an exactly tolerated ring arrangement <b>62</b> between the threaded bushing <b>55</b> and the bore hole of the bushing <b>48</b> accommodating this can be achieved. Depending upon the tightening torque that is applied to the fastening element <b>57</b>, an adherent connection is produced between the fastening element <b>57</b> and the threaded bushing <b>55</b>, which pretensions the bushing <b>48</b>, which is preferably manufactured of an elastomer material and represents the decoupling element <b>41</b> or <b>42</b> or <b>43</b>, in the axial direction so that stable linking of the wiper drive <b>1</b> to the vehicle body <b>24</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The embodiment of a wiper drive <b>1</b> proposed in accordance with the invention allows a wiper direct drive <b>30</b> to be realized in which the wiper drive shaft <b>14</b> is connected directly to the output shaft of the uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> of the wiper drive <b>1</b>. A nonuniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> (wiper linkage <b>15</b> in accordance with the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can thus be eliminated. The connection between the wiper drive <b>1</b>, a wiper motor <b>2</b> and a uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> that is integrated into this or a uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> that is flange-mounted on this, can be accomplished, according to the depictions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, directly on the vehicle body <b>24</b> beneath a windshield, on the one hand. On the other hand, this drive <b>1</b> can be mounted according to the proposed attainment on a holding plate <b>40</b> adapted to the installation space conditions. The decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are already integrated into the wiper drive <b>1</b> in an advantageous manner so that no additional decoupling elements must be supplied on the vehicle manufacturer side, but only screw-down surfaces must be provided on the vehicle body <b>24</b> or on the holding plate <b>40</b> with an appropriate hole pattern for accommodating the linking points <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. On the side of the wiper drive <b>1</b>, containing the wiper motor <b>2</b> and a uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b>, the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, which can be embodied as a bushing <b>48</b> manufactured of an elastomer material, can be integrated both into the housing of the wiper motor <b>2</b> as well as into the housing of the uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> that is allocated to it.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case of the attainment proposed in accordance with the invention, a standardized linking of the wiper drive <b>1</b> to a vehicle body <b>24</b> can be realized either directly on the vehicle body or indirectly via a holding plate <b>40</b> on the body. A reduction in the type variety can be achieved by using the same decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>. In particular, due to the elimination of an individually configurable motor holder <b>11</b> (see illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), it is possible to achieve a reduction in parts for a windshield wiper system whether this is for use in the front or rear windshields of vehicles. Considerably easier assembly of the wiper drive proposed in accordance with the invention can be achieved in vehicle final assembly due to the uniformly configured hole pattern with respect to the linking points <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>, at which one decoupling element <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, or <b>43</b> each is provided. The worker holds the wiper drive <b>1</b> in its joining position in one hand, while, with his other hand, he screws down the fastening elements <b>57</b> with the threaded bushings <b>54</b> that are already pre-mounted in the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> using a standard tool (screwdriver).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With regard to manufacturing the wiper drives <b>1</b> proposed in accordance with the invention, the decoupling elements <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and the fastening elements <b>55</b> surrounded by these can already be permanently connected to the housing of the uniform-transmission gear <b>3</b> or of the wiper motor <b>2</b> during assembly so that a reduction of the to-be-supplied individual parts can be achieved in the delivery or assembly of a so constituted wiper drive, which can also be used as wiper direct drive <b>30</b>.</p>
