<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Canadian Patent Application Serial No. 2,588,360 filed on May 11, 2007, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for the simultaneous cutting and splitting of wood into smaller pieces through the application of constant force of a splitting wedge onto the surface of a wood piece when in use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various log splitting devices have been devised and used for splitting logs such as conventional hand tools such as saws and axes or hand held wedges which are driven into a log in order to split the wood. Such devices, while inexpensive, require skilled manual labour, significant physical exertion and are very time intensive with regard to the use of hand tools. Other log splitting devices which have become fairly commonplace for splitting logs include large hydraulic cylinders which, generally speaking, is powered by an electric or gasoline engine and are typically aimed at commercial use, complex and expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typical of the prior art is Canadian Patent Application 2,146,291 (abandoned), which broadly teaches an automotive mechanical or manually actuated jack for use in splitting wood. As illustrated, the device includes a conventional automotive mechanical jack to which an axe head is attached. The mechanical jack, during the act of splitting the log or piece of wood, raises the base of the device and the wood to force the piece of wood into the axe head, such that the axe contacts and cuts into the center of the piece of wood to split the log.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another reference typical of the prior art is U.S. Pat. No. 5,535,795 to Bunn, which generally teaches the use of a conventional automotive jack for use in a log splitting apparatus. Bunn generally discloses an apparatus which includes the use of any type of jack arranged such that the wedge member is attached to the jack member and when manually actuated, the jack member moves downwardly such that the wedge splits the wood from a central point of the log. The jack is manually raised or lowered by means of the jack handle or lever.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other background references include U.S. Pat. No. 1,283,195 to Hunter, which discloses a motorized log splitting device, which includes a wedge which is forced into the center of a log to be split. U.S. Pat. No. 111,333 to Fitch discloses a log splitter, mounted in a horizontal orientation, to impart a force to the piece of wood to be split, including wood retaining means. U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,572 to Green, which discloses a vertically oriented wood splitter using a manually operated hydraulic jack, where the jack is raised using a lever or handle member to raise the piece of wood to force the wood into the axe head.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other references include U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,855 to Graham; U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,726 to Sieverin and U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,373 to Winiasz; all of which disclose powered horizontal and vertical splitters, which force the head of an axe or other wedge shaped device into the center of the log to be split.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Despite past attempts in this field, there remains a need for a simple, portable, cost efficient log splitter which is sufficiently powerful to cut or split pieces of wood or logs, and yet is simple and lightweight in construction. Preferably, such an improved wood splitting device has the ability to be easily and quickly dismantled for easy transportation and set up, simple to use and also to place in storage when not in use, for example home use or camping.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the mounting plate <b>72</b> further includes a spring button <b>76</b> to allow the wedge or axe head <b>80</b> to be easily removed or installed. The axe head <b>80</b> may be of a common shape (i.e., wedge shaped) and is adapted to slide into the track of the mounting bracket. The blade portion <b>90</b>, when in use, is adapted to cut into the piece of wood <b>15</b> to effect splitting of the wood.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, a mechanical drive means generally referred to by reference numeral <b>100</b> is adapted to tubular member <b>50</b> which is secured therein via detent means or indentations <b>56</b>. As illustrated, the preferred embodiment of the mechanical drive means <b>100</b> includes at one end thereof a ball screw end stop <b>102</b>, suitable torque absorber <b>103</b> and a screw rod <b>104</b> to which is attached at the opposite end thereof a ball screw nut or other similar means <b>106</b> and a screw or ball screw mounting plate <b>108</b> and a suitable torque absorber <b>103</b>, and a shaft collar <b>109</b>. As illustrated, the ball screw plate rests against indentations <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Outer or secondary tubular member <b>60</b> is adapted for placement over inner tube <b>50</b>, all of which is secured via assembly cap <b>112</b> through member <b>109</b> to the mechanical drive means inside tubular member <b>50</b>. Assembly cap <b>112</b> includes an upper portion <b>114</b> including an aperture which is adapted to house a backnut brake assembly <b>111</b> and to receive a further assembly <b>116</b> which is adapted to receive a crank arm <b>120</b> including handle <b>122</b> for manual actuation of the mechanical drive means to raise and lower the outer tubular portion <b>60</b> to effect the cutting and splitting of a piece of wood or log <b>15</b>. Mechanical drive means <b>100</b>, when in use exerts constant pressure or force via the wedge <b>80</b> on to the piece of wood or log <b>15</b>. Member <b>116</b>, in a preferred embodiment, is preferably a male hex or other similar means which is an operative relationship with the drive screw of the mechanical drive.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As such, the mechanical drive is adapted that it can be manually raised or lower by means of a removable/swivel type handle such as the crank arm <b>120</b> and handle <b>122</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the drive may also be actuated through the use of a ratchet and socket, adjustable wrench, or open ended wrench. Further, a drive bit may be used in combination with an electric motor such as attached to a drill or other means to effect the raising and lowering of the wedge into the piece of wood.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation and use, the apparatus <b>10</b> is positioned on the ground or other generally horizontal surface with the base members <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> supporting the generally vertically extending members <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>. A log or other piece of wood <b>15</b> is then placed immediately below the wedge <b>80</b> on top of horizontally extending member <b>20</b> and maintained in such a position while a user, either manually or otherwise, lowers the axe head to engage the blade portion <b>90</b> to the upper surface of the log <b>15</b>. As illustrated, the blade <b>90</b> contacts the piece of wood or log <b>15</b> at the edge of the log. In particular, the wedge via blade <b>90</b> engages the outer circumference of the log to be split when the log is placed between the frame <b>20</b> and the wedge <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, a user then may actuate the mechanical drive means to effect lowering of the outer tubular member <b>60</b> about the lower or inner member <b>50</b> to cut and split the piece of wood via wedge <b>80</b> to begin splitting and cutting of the log <b>15</b>. As the user manually or otherwise actuates or effects movement of the drive, this causes the splitting wedge or axe to apply a constant force to cause the piece of wood <b>15</b> to split. The user continues this action until the wedge splits the log <b>15</b>. Advantageously, it has been found that the use of the tubular frame <b>20</b> assists in localizing the force exerted by the wedge <b>80</b> to the log <b>15</b> thus assisting in a more efficient split and cut of the piece of wood or log <b>15</b>. As noted hereinabove, the constant pressure exerted by the mechanical drive means via the wedge <b>80</b> to the piece of wood <b>15</b> applies a constant force engaging at least a portion of the outer circumference of the log to effect a more efficient splitting and cutting of the wood.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The height of the first tubular member <b>50</b> may be raised or lowered via locking means (for example pins <b>18</b>) releasably inserted in to apertures <b>18</b> to accommodate different sizes or pieces of wood to be cut. This allows the height of the member <b>50</b> to be quickly and securely adjusted to different sizes of logs or wood. Through the continued manual actuation of the mechanical drive means results in the wedge completely splitting the log or piece of wood. The split portions of the piece of wood or log <b>15</b> typically fall to either side of the generally horizontal member <b>20</b> after which the wedge can be manually or otherwise mechanically raised to accommodate a new log to allow the user to repeat the process to cut and split additional pieces of wood.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an alternative embodiment, the user operated handle may be replaced with motorized means to effect the raising and lowering of the wedge. This may be powered through a motor, drill or other suitable drive means.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The base <b>20</b> preferably includes means to allow the apparatus to be used free standing, or in an alternative embodiment, wall or floor mounted with the use of suitable brackets or mounting means. Alternatively, the apparatus <b>10</b> may be used in combination with a conventional hitch receiver of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an alternative embodiment, the backnut brake assembly <b>111</b> may be located within an upper part of the outer member <b>60</b>, for example, resting on a plate that is fastened (through suitable means such as welding) to the inside of the outer member at a desired height. Alternatively, indentations or other suitable means could be provided to hold the plate in place. In a further preferred embodiment, the end cap assembly <b>112</b> may be smaller cap, such that it could be separate from the backnut brake assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a further alternative aspect, flange bearings or similar means may be provided to assist the torque absorbers <b>103</b> to allow the ballscrew to be free turning once it bottoms or tops out. Desirably, a further flange bearing could be added to the shaft <b>110</b> to prevent the shaft collar <b>109</b> from being in constant contact with the top of the outer member, thus preventing metal-to-metal contact.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As noted above, the present invention provides advantages over the prior art and for that matter other hand tools as commonly used to split or cut wood such as an axe or splitting wedge. The present invention also provides a safer device and method for splitting wood than, for example, someone using an axe to split the wood which could potentially cause injury by users who are unskilled or inexperienced with the proper use of an axe or splitting wedge.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While one embodiment of the present invention has been described in the foregoing description, it is to be understood that other embodiments are possible within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
