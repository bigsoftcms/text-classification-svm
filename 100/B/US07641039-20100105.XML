<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A positive displacement article sorter and method of monitoring a positive displacement article sorter, wherein the article sorter includes a frame, an endless web traveling in a longitudinal direction about the frame and an electric motor driving the endless web. The endless web is defined by a pair of continuous chains and a plurality of cross members connected at opposite ends with the chain. The positive displacement sorter includes a plurality of pusher shoes, each laterally traveling along at least one of the cross members. A sensing assembly is provided that has first and second portions. The first portion of said sensing assembly is positioned at the web. The second portion of said sensing assembly is positioned at a stationary location. The first portion of said sensing assembly is sensed with the second portion of the sensing assembly as the first portion of said sensing assembly travels about the frame. A parameter of the web is determined from an output of the sensing assembly.</p>

No. 7,370,751, which claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to conveyor systems having an endless web that is defined by laterally extending parallel cross members that are connected at opposite ends, such as by chains, and in particular to a method of correcting skew in the cross members resulting from unequal expansion of the chains on opposite sides of the web. The invention is particularly adapted for use with article sorters, but may be applied to other such conveyor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An article sorter, such as the RS200 positive displacement sorter marketed by Dematic Corporation of Grand Rapids, Mich., has an endless web that is made up elongated parallel slats that are interconnected by a matched pair of chains. The web is supported by carrier wheels attached to the sides of the chains. Because of the nature of a positive displacement sorter, wear on the chains tends to not be the same. Therefore, one chain tends to stretch more than the other chain. This can cause the slats to become skewed. Skew is where the slats, which are normally perpendicular to the direction of movement of the web, become non-perpendicular to such direction. Skew causes the carrier wheels to be at an angle to the direction of movement of the web. This causes an increase in chain drag resulting in additional energy required to propel the web as well as extra wear on the sorter. Also, excessive skew of the slats can cause problems with tracking articles on the sorter and proper diverting of the articles to the desired lanes for sortation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Uneven elongation of the chains leads to one of the chains requiring replacement prematurely. As the chains are a matched set, uneven elongation of either chain leads to both of the chains being replaced prematurely. This is very expensive because it essentially requires an almost complete disassembly of the web.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to a positive displacement article sorter and method of monitoring a positive displacement article sorter. A positive displacement article sorter includes a frame, an endless web traveling in a longitudinal direction about the frame and an electric motor driving the endless web. The endless web is defined by a pair of continuous chains and a plurality of cross members connected at opposite ends with the chain. The positive displacement sorter includes a plurality of pusher shoes, each laterally traveling along at least one of the cross members.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the invention, a sensing assembly is provided that has first and second portions. The first portion of said sensing assembly is positioned at the web. The second portion of said sensing assembly is positioned at a stationary location. The first portion of said sensing assembly is sensed with the second portion of the sensing assembly as the first portion of said sensing assembly travels about the frame. A parameter of the web is determined from an output of the sensing assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The parameter of the web may be one that affects electrical energy consumed by the electric motor. The parameter of the web may be a function of the position of the web.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sensing assembly may be a magnetic sensor, a proximity sensor or a photo sensor. The first portion of the sensing assembly may be positioned at one or more of the cross members. The first portion of the sensing assembly may be positioned at two spaced apart ones of the cross members.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plurality of cross members may include a plurality of closely spaced slats. Each of the slats may have a generally planar upper surface, wherein the web defines a flat-top conveying surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the invention, positions of opposite lateral sides of the endless web are sensed in the longitudinal direction by a sensing assembly as the endless web travels about the frame. A control is provided that is responsive to the sensing assembly and is adapted to determine whether one of the opposite lateral sides of the endless web lags or leads the other of the opposite lateral sides in the longitudinal direction as a function of the positions of the opposite lateral sides of the endless web in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The control may indicate drag of the endless web on the frame as a function of an amount that one of the opposite lateral sides lags or leads the other of the opposite lateral sides in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The control may sense positions of the opposite lateral sides of the endless web at an article input end of the endless web.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first portion of the sensing assembly may be at opposite lateral sides of the endless web. A second portion of the sensing assembly may be at a stationary location. The second portion senses the first portion of said sensing assembly as the first portion of said sensing assembly travels about the frame. The sensing assembly may include a magnetic sensor, a proximity sensor or a photo sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first portion of the sensing assembly may be at opposite lateral ends of at least one of the cross members and may be at opposite lateral ends of at least two spaced apart ones of the cross members. The control may determine whether one of the opposite lateral sides of the endless web lags or leads the other of the lateral sides in the longitudinal direction as a function of diagonal distances measured between the first portion of the sensing assembly at opposite lateral ends of the at least two spaced apart ones of the cross members.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plurality of cross members may be a plurality of closely spaced slats. Each of the slats may have a generally planar upper surface, wherein the web defines a flat-top conveying surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other objects, advantages and features of this invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a conveyor system <b>25</b> includes an endless web <b>26</b> made up of a plurality of cross members <b>28</b> that are interconnected at opposite ends by attaching the cross members, using fasteners <b>31</b> and special adapters <b>33</b>, to left and right chains <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>). The endless web travels in a longitudinal direction, which is illustrated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrative embodiment, conveyor system <b>25</b> is a positive displacement shoe and slat sorter of the type disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,738,347; 5,127,510; 5,165,515; 5,732,814; 5,927,465; 6,041,909; 6,513,642; 6,814,216; 6,860,383; and 6,935,483, the disclosures of which are hereby collectively incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, cross members <b>28</b> are closely spaced slats having generally planar upper surfaces thereby defining a flat-top conveying surface. A plurality of pusher shoes <b>32</b> is provided. Each pusher shoe selectively travels laterally along one of the cross members in order to laterally displace an article traveling on the conveying surface. This causes the article to be diverted to one of several spurs (not shown) in order to sort the articles according to some scheme. In an alternative conveyor system <b>125</b>, cross members <b>128</b> are in the form of rounded tubular members and pusher shoes <b>132</b> travel along a plurality of cross-members (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, conveyor system <b>25</b> is subject to a condition, known as &#x201c;slat skew,&#x201d; in which cross members <b>28</b> become non-perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of propulsion of web <b>26</b>, which is indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The amount of slat skew is indicated by the angle &#x3b1;, but also can be expressed as the difference between the position of one end of a cross member <b>28</b> from the other end of the cross member. Skew can be both plus or minus depending upon which lateral end of the slat lags the other end. Slat skew is caused when chains <b>30</b> stretch unevenly from one side of the web to the other side. As the skew on the slats increases, carrier wheels <b>35</b> will be angled to the direction of flow which pushes the web into the side wear strip (not shown) and causes an increase in chain drag. Increases in chain drag require more horsepower to pull the chain which increases the amount of electrical energy consumed. Excess slat skew may also cause article tracking and divert problems.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to overcome slat skew, a skew detector <b>34</b> is provided (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Skew detector <b>34</b> includes laterally spaced apart sensors <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, which are positioned to identify laterally spaced apart triggers <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>on one of the slats. In the illustrative embodiment, triggers <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>are magnetic targets and sensors <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>are magnetic proximity sensors which detect the magnetic target. A pair of targets <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>are mounted to each of a &#x201c;start&#x201d; cross member <b>128</b> and an &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross member (not shown). The &#x201c;start&#x201d; and &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross members are spaced apart in web <b>26</b> by an amount that, in the illustrated embodiments, is 100 feet. While the slat spacing is not critical, it should be less than half of the web length. Sensors <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>are connected via conductors <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>with inputs <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>of a high-speed counter circuit <b>38</b>. Counter circuit <b>38</b> is an input card of a control system <b>37</b>, such as a programmable logic controller of the type known in the art. In the illustrative embodiment, control system <b>37</b> is a Momentum&#x2122; programmable logic controller (PLC) marketed by Modicon. A clock signal, which is 1 millisecond in the illustrated embodiments, is received on an input <b>42</b> of counter circuit <b>38</b>. In operation, counter circuit <b>38</b> counts the number of clock pulses <b>42</b> beginning with the detection of the respective targets <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>on the &#x201c;start&#x201d; cross member <b>128</b> and ending with detection of the corresponding triggers <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>on the &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross member (not shown). In this manner, counter circuit <b>38</b> counts the amount of time between passage of each lateral end of the &#x201c;start&#x201d; cross member to the corresponding lateral end of the &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross member. Counter circuit <b>38</b> also counts the number of clock pulses along the diagonals between a start trigger <b>46</b><i>a </i>and end trigger <b>46</b><i>b </i>and between a start trigger <b>46</b><i>b </i>and end trigger <b>46</b><i>a</i>. The diagonal measurements are designated H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>. The magnetic targets on the start and end slats may be distinguishable, such as by coding, or the like, but this is not always necessary. Skew detector <b>34</b> is positioned at an upstream end of web <b>26</b>, such as where articles are placed onto the web. The reason is that web <b>26</b> is typically driven at a downstream end where all articles have been discharged from the web by a pair of sprockets driving the corresponding chains <b>30</b>. The drive sprockets (not shown) are fixed to a motor-driven shaft and are thereby rotated in unison. Therefore, any skew in the cross members is not present at the discharge end, namely, the downstream end, of web <b>26</b>. Idler sprockets (not shown) at the article input upstream portion of web <b>26</b> are independent freely rotatable. Therefore, slat skew is at a maximum at the article input end, namely, the upstream end, of web <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The manner in which slat skew detector <b>34</b> can measure skew in web <b>26</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. It can be seen that when there is no slat skew, the diagonal measurements H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> between the lateral ends of the &#x201c;start&#x201d; and &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross members are equal. Thus, when the number of pulses measured for H<b>1</b> equals the number of pulses for H<b>2</b> within a given tolerance, it is determined that there is no corrective action required. When the number of pulses for H<b>1</b> exceeds those for H<b>2</b>, or vice versa, skew can be determined using the table in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Angle &#x3b1; is the angle of skew. &#x201c;Skew B&#x201d; is the amount of lag distance of one lateral end of the cross member with respect to the other lateral end of that cross member in the direction of web movement. Pulse differences can be either positive or negative. If positive, the amount of skew is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. If negative, the skew is the opposite with the right lateral end of the cross members lagging behind the left lateral end of the cross members, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An alternative skew detector <b>134</b> includes a detector assembly <b>44</b> that is positioned below cross members <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>). Detector assembly <b>44</b> includes four detectors <b>136</b><i>a</i>, <b>136</b><i>b</i>, <b>136</b><i>c</i>, <b>136</b><i>d</i>, two of which are oriented toward each lateral end of the cross member. In the illustrative embodiment, sensors <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>d </i>are magnetic sensors. Magnets <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>are positioned on a &#x201c;start&#x201d; cross member <b>228</b> in a position that they will be detected by sensors <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b</i>. Two magnets <b>146</b><i>c </i>and <b>146</b><i>d </i>are positioned on &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross member <b>328</b> at a position that they will be detected by sensors <b>136</b><i>c</i>, <b>136</b><i>d</i>. Thus, skew detector <b>134</b> is similar to skew detector <b>34</b> except that separate sensors are used to detect the &#x201c;start&#x201d; cross member targets and the &#x201c;end&#x201d; cross member targets. Sensors <b>136</b><i>a</i>, <b>136</b><i>d </i>are connected to gate channel <b>41</b><i>a</i>. Sensors <b>136</b><i>c </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>are connected to gate channel <b>41</b><i>b</i>. Placement of magnets <b>146</b><i>a</i>-<b>146</b><i>d </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Determination of skew with skew detector <b>134</b> is similar to that for skew detector <b>34</b>. There is a slight variation in measurement of diagonals H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> because the &#x201c;end&#x201d; triggers <b>146</b><i>c</i>, <b>146</b><i>d </i>are closer together than the &#x201c;start&#x201d; triggers <b>146</b><i>a</i>, <b>146</b><i>b</i>. However, any difference is minuscule over the 100-foot measurement range and is found to not appreciably affect the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the amount and direction of skew is determined, indicating that one of the chains <b>30</b> is stretched more than the other chain <b>30</b>, a differential lubricant applicator <b>50</b> applies a lesser amount of lubricant to the less-stretched chain than to the more-stretched chain. This results in the less-stretched chain stretching more relative to the greater stretched chain, thereby resulting in the chains becoming more equal in stretch, thereby reducing the slat skew. While it may seem counterproductive to withhold lubricant from one of the two chains, it should be understood that it is the differential in the amount of stretch of the chain that results in premature wear to the chains, not the stretch of the chains, per se.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Differential lubricant applicator <b>50</b> includes a manifold assembly <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Manifold assembly <b>52</b> includes &#x201c;side A&#x201d; manifolds <b>54</b> and &#x201c;side B&#x201d; manifolds <b>56</b>. Side A manifolds <b>54</b> are connected to conveyor system <b>25</b> in order to lubricate the chain of the takeaway side of the web, namely, the side to which articles are diverted. Side B manifolds <b>56</b> are connected to conveyor system <b>25</b> in order to lubricate the chain on the other side of the web. Manifold assembly <b>52</b> includes chain manifolds <b>58</b> responsible for lubricating the chains on opposite sides of the web. Manifold assembly <b>52</b> further includes wheel manifolds <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>which are responsible for lubricating the wheels and axles at two locations on each side of the web. Manifold assembly <b>52</b> includes an air regulator <b>62</b> and a control panel <b>63</b>. Each manifold includes inverter air valve <b>64</b>, a nozzle air valve <b>66</b> and an injector block <b>68</b>. Each lubricant manifold delivers an aerosol of oil and air mixture to the conveyor system in a manner that will be apparent to the skilled artisan. In the illustrative embodiment, differential lubricant applicator <b>50</b> is marketed by Orsco under Model No. VSR-0038-6-8 or equivalent lubrication system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Chain manifolds <b>58</b> deliver the lubricant aerosol to left and right chain lubricant nozzle assemblies <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>(<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>). Each chain lubricant nozzle assembly includes a pair of nozzle tips <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>b </i>which lubricate the chain links on opposite sides of the respective chain. The nozzle assembly includes a mounting bracket <b>74</b> for mounting to a convenient portion of the conveyor system <b>25</b> and a body <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>for connecting with tubing (not shown) leading back to chain manifold <b>58</b> and for conveying the aerosol to nozzle tip <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrative embodiment, each nozzle tip <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>b </i>is approximately three inches in length having a zero-degree spray pattern which produces a vertical cone, as is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Wheel manifolds <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>lead to a wheel/axle lubricant nozzle assembly <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>). Each wheel/axle lubricant nozzle assembly includes a horizontally oriented nozzle tip <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>extending from a body <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>. Each body <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b </i>connects with tubing (not shown) leading to the respective wheel manifold <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>and provides the lubricant aerosol to the corresponding nozzle tip <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>. A mounting bracket <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b </i>mounts the body and, hence, the nozzle tip to the conveyor system at a convenient location. The purpose of the wheel/axle lubricant nozzle assembly is to apply lubricant to the circumference of a carrier wheel <b>35</b> and the axle face of each carrier plate <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Two wheel/axle lubricant nozzle assemblies are provided on each side of conveyor system <b>25</b>. Nozzle tip <b>88</b><i>a</i>, <b>88</b><i>b </i>in the illustrative embodiment is approximately three inches in length and has a 45 degree spray pattern which produces a cone of aerosol at an approximate 45 degree angle.</p>

The wheel/axle nozzle assemblies <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>are mounted at both the charge and discharge ends of the conveyor system as illustrated respectively to the left and right ends of frame assembly <b>27</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The chain lubricant nozzle assemblies <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>are mounted at the discharge end, or downstream end, of conveyor system <b>25</b>, to the right as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The chain lubricant nozzle assemblies are positioned inside the catenary bed. However, it should be understood that the positioning of the nozzle assemblies is for illustration purposes only and other locations may be apparent to the skilled artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to differentially lubricate chains <b>30</b>, differential lubricant applicator <b>50</b> causes lubricant to be applied during an &#x201c;on&#x201d; period and not applied during an &#x201c;off&#x201d; period thereby establishing an application duty cycle. If it is desirable to apply more lubricant to a particular chain, the duty cycle is increased by decreasing the off time of the nozzle assembly. If it is desired to apply less lubricant to a particular chain, the duty cycle is decreased by increasing the off time of the respective nozzle assembly. One scheme for carrying out such differential lubrication is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates six columns illustrating the off cycles for the two chain lubricant nozzle assemblies <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>and the four wheel/axle lubricant nozzles <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. The corresponding &#x201c;on&#x201d; time is about one (1) second. The horizontal rows correspond to the amount of skew that is measured by skew detector <b>34</b>, <b>134</b>. As previously set forth, skew can be negative or positive values depending upon which lateral end of the cross members lags the other lateral end. It can be seen that for small amounts of skew, only slight variations in duty cycle are provided for opposite sides of the web. Thus, for small amounts of skew in the cross members, only a slightly greater amount of lubricant is applied to the stretched chain than to the opposite chain. However, for large amounts of skew in the cross members, almost all of the lubricant is applied to the stretched chain and little to the unstretched chain.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Variations may be made in the illustrated embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, although the differential lubricant applicator is illustrated as an aerosol applicator, mechanical applicators or drip lubricant applicators may be utilized. Also, although the skew detection is illustrated via an automated system, manual measurements of skew may also be utilized especially where the conveyor system is shut down for certain periods of the day, thus enabling skew to be manually measured. Although the invention was illustrated with a sortation conveyor, the conveyor system may, alternatively, be a slat conveyor, a traveling walkway, a baggage carrousel, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Changes and modifications in the specifically described embodiments can be carried out without departing from the principles of the invention which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims, as interpreted according to the principles of patent law including the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
