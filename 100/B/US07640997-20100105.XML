<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase Application under 35 USC 371 of International Application PCT/SE2006/000603 filed May 24, 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a breaker tool that comprises a chassis and a motor mounted thereon, an impact mechanism driven by the motor and arranged to operate in a certain working direction, a enclosure which surrounds at least the motor, and a handle device comprising two handles protruding at opposite sides of the enclosure and being vibration damped relative to the chassis via swing arms, wherein the swing arms are arranged to accomplish a flexible connection for parallel movement between the chassis and the handle device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A breaker tool according to the preamble is previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,043. One of the advantages with the breaker tool described in this publication is that the handle thanks to swing arms is well vibration damped as to movements originating from the impact work performed by the breaker tool. A disadvantage is that the breaker tool is comparatively bulky due to the fact that the surrounding enclosure has to be large enough to allow primarily the vibration movements of the motor relative to the handles which are mounted on the enclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regarding the above background the subject with the invention is to provide a breaker tool which is as well vibration damped as the tool according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,043 as regard movements originating from the breaker tool impact movements but being more compact and easier to handle than that tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention the above subject is accomplished in a breaker tool described in the preamble in that the enclosure is connected to the chassis, that the handle device comprises a bridge which extends across the chassis inside the enclosure and carrying the handles, that the swing arms are pivotally connected to the bridge via first pivots and to the chassis via second pivots, whereof at least one of the pivots is a torsion pivot which provides a limited torsion damped swinging movement of the bridge substantially parallel with the working direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By forming the handle device as a bridge located inside the enclosure in accordance with the invention the enclosure may surround the motor in quite tightly which means that the dimensions of the enclosure may be considerably reduced compared to previous tools. Thanks to the tighter enclosure and the rigid mounting of the enclosure it is also possible to integrate the enclosure in a necessary motor cooling fan system and to use the enclosure for guiding an air flow from the fan system to accomplish clean blowing of the working area of the breaker tool. The advantage with the solution comprising at least one torsion pivot is that such a pivot has a low weight as well as a defined centre position from which pivoting in two opposite directions is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the torsion pivot comprises a cylindrical elastomeric bush which has a core rotationally locked to the respective swing arm, and a mantle which is rotationally locked to chassis and the bridge. As an alternative, the torsion pivot may comprise a cylindrical elastomeric bush with a mantle which is rotationally locked to the respective swing arm, and a core that is rotationally locked to the chassis and the bridge, respectively. One of the advantages with these two solutions is that the elastomeric bush apart from its torsion properties also provides a certain elasticity which contributes to keep away vibrations from the handles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, a first pair of parallel swing arms are arranged on opposite sides of the chassis, and a second pair of parallel swing arms are arranged on opposite sides of the chassis, such that these pairs, in relation to the working direction, are located on opposite sides of the handles. The advantage gained by this is that such a solution results in an even load on the swing arms of the handle device and also an even vibration damping along the entire movement range of the handle device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Suitably, one of the first and second pairs of parallel swing arms rotationally locked to a common rod which is rotationally locked to the core of the respective elastomeric bush. Such a solution is advantageous primarily by strength reasons, because a rod which is common to two swing arms is able to distribute forces in a better way than separate stub axles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to first alternative, the breaker tool comprises a combustion engine having a fuel tank preferably mounted on the bridge inside the enclosure. Apart from avoiding fuel leakage from a vibration damped tank it is desirable to have as big mass as possible on the bridge and handles in relation to the rest of the breaker tool so as to achieve an optimum vibration damping.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a second alternative the breaker tool comprises an electric motor with an electronic control unit mounted on the bridge inside the enclosure. The advantage gained by this is primarily to protect the impact sensitive electronics and to extend the service life of these parts.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the electric motor is an electronically commutated permanent magnet motor which has a motor shaft with a crank arm which via a connecting rod operates the breaker tool impact mechanism. The advantage gained by using a permanent magnet motor is the fact that such a motor can provide power enough at low revs already thereby being able to operate the impact mechanism without any reduction gearing which would steal energy and form another vibration source.</p>
