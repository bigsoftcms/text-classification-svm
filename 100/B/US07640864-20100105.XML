<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A non-magnetic concrete structure having no magnetism or a very small magnetic permeability without reinforcing steel bars arranged, a sidewall for a guideway, and a method for installing the sidewall for the guideway are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0002" num="0000">The reinforcing steel bars-free sidewall <b>11</b> for the guideway <b>10</b> is constructed by using a non-magnetic concrete structure constructed by using a fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material and having no reinforcing steel bars therein. The fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material is produced by mixing non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metal fibers into a cement-based matrix in a mixing amount of 1 to 4% for an entire volume of the cement-based matrix. The cement-based matrix is obtained by mixing a composition with water. The above composition is composed of cement, aggregate grains having a maximum grain diameter of not more than 2.5 mm, pozzolanic reaction particles having particle diameters of not more than 15 &#x3bc;m and supper plasticizer. The fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material has mechanical properties: a compressive strength of not less than 150 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and a tensile strength of not less than 5 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a non-magnetic concrete structure to be constructed at a place where a non-magnetic material is desired to be used, such as a guideway for the superconducting Magnetically Levitated Vehicle (Maglev), a compass checking apron in an airport, a nuclear fusion experimental reactor, an electrolytic refining furnace or the like. The invention also relates to a sidewall for a guideway attached with ground coils for propulsion, levitation and guidance for a superconducting Maglev, and a method for installing the sidewall for the guideway.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">A guideway <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is conventionally known, on which a superconducting Maglev 1 is run in a superconducting Magler system (See Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">During low-speed running, supporting wheels <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>are projected from the lower face of the superconducting Maglev 1, and run on wheel-running paths <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>, respectively. On the other hand, during high-speed running, the vehicle is levitated and driven forward through magnetic interaction between superconductive magnets <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>a </i>provided at opposite side faces of the vehicle and ground coils <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>a </i>provided on opposite sidewalls <b>3</b>, <b>3</b> of the guideway <b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Although the sidewall <b>3</b> is constructed by reinforced concrete, there is a problem that if the sidewalls <b>3</b> have high magnetism, magnetic resistance increases and electric power consumption necessary for running rises.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Under circumstances, non-magnetic metals are used for the reinforcing bars for use in constructing the sidewall <b>3</b>. Although austenitic stainless steel and high-Mn steel are known as the non-magnetic metals having low magnetic permeability, the stainless steel has such defects when used as the reinforcing bar that stainless steel is expensive, non-magnetic characteristic is largely deteriorated in working and its yield strength is low (See Patent Literature 2).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">To the contrary, the reinforcing bar made of the high-Mn steel exhibits high strength and stable non-magnetic characteristic, and is less expensive than the stainless steel, the high-Mn steel has been used for the non-magnetic reinforcing bars <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">On the other hand, there occur problems that if a gap between the <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the superconducting magnet <b>1</b><i>a </i>is wide, propulsion force decreases and the electric power consumption increases, whereas if it is narrow, the ground coil may contact the magnet, construction and management are required to be done at high accuracy (See Patent Document 3).

<p id="p-0010" num="0011">However, the above non-magnetic reinforcing bar <b>6</b> has low magnetic permeability, but this magnetic permeability is still around 1.0. Thus, if such non-magnetic reinforcing bars are arranged near an inner side face of the sidewall <b>3</b>, they cause the magnetic resistance to increase to no small extent. Consequently, the electric power consumption necessary for running unfavorably increases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Under the circumstances, the present invention is aimed at providing a non-magnetic concrete structure having no magnetism or every small magnetic permeability and containing no reinforcing steel bars, a sidewall for a guideway and a method for installing such a sidewall for the guideway.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Countermeasure for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In order to realize the above object, the present invention is directed to a non-magnetic concrete structure constructed by using a fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material and having no reinforcing steel bars therein, said fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material being produced by mixing non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metal fibers into a cement-based matrix in a mixing amount of 1 to 4% for an entire volume of the cement-based matrix, said cement-based matrix being obtained by mixing a composition with water, said composition comprising cement, aggregate grains having a maximum grain diameter of not more than 2.5 mm, pozzolanic reaction particles having particle diameters of not more than 15 &#x3bc;m and supper plasticizer, said fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material having mechanical properties: a compressive strength of not less than 150 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and a tensile strength of not less than 5 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">The above invention may be characterized in that prestressing force is introduced by non-metallic prestressing cables or non-magnetic metallic members passed through the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">The present invention is directed to a sidewall for a guideway constructed as said non-magnetic concrete structure, said sidewall for the guideway being to be attached with a ground coil for propulsion of a superconducting Maglev, said sidewall comprising a beam portion, a plane-shaped support base seat, a wall portion to which the ground coil is to be attached, and reinforcing ribs which are arranged at an interval in said extending direction, said beam portion and said support base seat being extended in an extending direction of the guideway and vertically spaced from each other, said beam portion and said support base seat being connected by said wall, a back face of the wall portion and an upper face of the support base seat being connected by the reinforcing ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Further, the present invention is directed to a method for installing the above-mentioned sidewall for the guideway on a floor slab, said method comprising interposing a position-adjusting mat between said floor slab and said support base seat, said position-adjusting mat being adapted to be inflated by filling a filler therein, adjusting a location of said sidewall by filling the filler into the position-adjusting mat, and fixing the support base seat to the floor slab after the filler is cured.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The above installing method may be characterized in that when sidewalls are to be connected in the extending direction of the guideway, while a gap is ensured between the adjacent sidewalls, said method comprising forming connecting holes in said reinforcing ribs arranged at end faces of the sidewalls, respectively, such that each of the connecting hole passes the reinforcing rib in the extending direction, inserting connecting member through the connecting holes, said connecting member being provided with two outer tubes made of a non-magnetic metal and slidable along a central shaft portion thereof, bringing the slidable direction substantially in conformity with the extending direction, filling a joining agent between the outer tubes and the connecting hoes, and fixing the outer tubes to the connecting holes, respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effects of The Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">According to the thus constructed invention, the structure is constructed by use of the high-strength, fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material having no magnetism or very small magnetic permeability and employing non-magnetic metallic fibers or non-magnetic metallic fibers without use of reinforcing steel bars.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">Therefore, the non-magnetic concrete structure having no magnetism or very small magnetic permeability can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Further, the structure can be constructed by introducing prestressing force with the non-metallic prestressing member or the non-magnetic metal prestressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Thus, cracking resistance or ultimate bearing capacity of the non-magnetic concrete structure can be enhanced. Thereby, the thickness of the structure can be made extremely thin, so that the weight can be largely reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Accordingly, the above non-magnetic concrete structure can be formed as a sidewall of the guideway in which a superconducting Maglev is to be run. Further, since a load can be distributed over the extending direction with the beam portion, the sectional area of the sidewall can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Consequently, the magnetic permeability of the sidewall which is desired to be a structure having low magnetic permeability can be reduced, and the electric power consumption necessary for running the superconducting Maglev.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Since the sectional area of the sidewall can be largely decreased owing to its structural property, the weight can be largely reduced. When the weight of the sidewall can be largely reduced like this, sizes of structural bodies located under it, such as a floor slab, a bridge pier, a foundation, etc. can be also miniaturized to reduce the entire construction cost to a large extent.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Further, according to the guideway-installing method of the present invention, the position-adjusting mat is interposed between the sidewall-installing floor slab and the support base seat, and the position of the sidewall is adjusted by introducing the filler under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Owing to this, the sidewall can be easily installed to meet a positional control at a high precision of an order of 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">In the present invention, after the connecting member is inserted through the connecting holes formed in the reinforcing ribs and the sliding direction is almost in coincidence with the extending direction, the outer pipes can be fixed to the connecting hole.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">Thus, the connecting portion capable of coping with changes in temperature can be easily constructed. In addition, the sidewall of the guideway installed according to the above method can transmit a load onto the adjacent sidewall via the connecting member, the end portion of each sidewall can ensure the same sectional rigidity and load resistance performance as in the central portion and maintain continuity between the sidewalls can be maintained.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">In the following, the best mode for carrying out the invention will be explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Explanation will be made, while same reference numerals are given to portions identical or equivalent to those in the conventional example.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are views showing the construction of a sidewall <b>11</b> of a guideway <b>10</b> as a non-magnetic concrete structure according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">First referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the entire construction of the guideway <b>10</b> of the present embodiment will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The guideway <b>10</b> in which a superconducting Maglev 1 (not shown) is to run is constructed by floor slabs <b>14</b> and sidewalls <b>11</b>, <b>11</b> opposed to each other at a constant space on the floor slabs. As to a bridge, such floor slabs <b>14</b> are placed on bridge beams of the bridge. As to an earth fill or a tunnel, such floor slabs <b>14</b> are placed on a supporting road.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">Wheel-running paths <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>a </i>to be used at low-speed running are provided in parallel in an extending direction on floor slabs <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">In this embodiment, the sidewalls <b>11</b> are arranged in the extending direction of the guideway <b>10</b>, and ground coils <b>12</b> to be used for levitation and propulsion of the superconducting Maglev 1 are attached.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">Further, in order to reduce the magnetic resistance in running the superconducting Maglev 1, the sidewall <b>11</b> is desirably a structure having an extremely low magnetic permeability or no magnetism. Thus, according to the present embodiment, the sidewall <b>11</b> is formed by using a fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material given below, without use of reinforcing steel bars.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">This fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material is produced by producing a cement-based matrix through a composition containing cement, aggregate grains, pozzolanic reaction particles, supper plasticizer and water and then mixing non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metallic fibers into the thus produced cement-based matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">As the aggregate grains, an aggregate material having the maximum grain size diameter of not more than 2.5 mm, preferably not more than 2 mm is used. As to the pozzolanic reaction particles, those having grain size diameters of not more than 15 &#x3bc;m are used. For example, as highly active pozzolanic reaction particles having particle diameters of 0.01 to 0.5 &#x3bc;m, silica fume or the like is used. On the other hand, as to less active pozzolanic reaction particles having particle diameters of 0.1 to 15 &#x3bc;m, fly ash, blast-furnace slag or the like is used. These pozzolanic reaction particles having different activities may be mixed or each of them may be singly used. Further, at least one kind of the supper plasticizer is used for enhancing fluid-like flowing property.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">As the non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metal fibers, materials having diameters of about 0.05 to about 0.3 mm and lengths of about 8 to about 16 mm are used, for example. As such non-metallic fibers, vinylon fibers, carbon fibers, glass fibers, polypropylene fibers or the like are used. As the non-magnetic metallic fibers, stainless fibers or the like are used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Such non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metallic fibers are mixed in an amount of around 1 to around 4% of the entire volume of the fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material produced above. This fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material produced to have the above composition becomes a material exhibiting compressive strength of at least 150 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and tensile strength of not less than 5 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">With respect to a test sample (4 cm&#xd7;4 cm&#xd7;16 cm), the mixed material is a material which exhibits a ductile property: bending tensile strength of not less than 20 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and excellent ductility that a fracture energy in bending fracture is 200 to 300 times as large as that of the conventional concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">Since the mixed material has such properties, the structure can be constructed without steel bar reinforcement as in the conventional reinforced concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Since this fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material has a very small water/cement ratio of less than 0.24 with a dense structure, chloride iron diffusion coefficient and water permeability coefficient are smaller than those in the conventional concrete by an order of 2 digits. Consequently, the fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material is completely free from deterioration due to carbonation or freezing-thawing, so that its non-deteriorated time period can be considered as an order of 100 year.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Further, since the above fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material has the low water/cement ratio but high flow property (a flow value of 240 mm to 260 mm in a mortar flow test), minute and complicated shapes can be formed at high precision without using a vibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">When the fire-reinforced cement-based mixed material is subjected to primary curing (20 to 25&#xb0; C. for 24 to 30 hours) and then cured with steam (90&#xb0; C. for 48 hours), the material exhibits 100% strength. Further, since the material is completely free from deformation due to shrinkage in drying after the curing, the material has the property that no cracking occurs due to shrinkage in drying.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">The sidewall <b>11</b> produced from the fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material is constituted by a beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>extending in an extending direction of the guideway <b>10</b>, a support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>extended in the same direction as the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>while being vertically spaced from the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a</i>, a wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>connecting the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>with the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>, and reinforcing rib <b>11</b><i>d </i>bridging a back face of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>and an upper face of the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>, while the material is not reinforced with steel bar reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>is a member functioning to distribute, in the extending direction, a load occurring in running the superconducting Maglev 1 or the like. The beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>is an long shaped member having an almost rectangular sectional shape, and prestressing force is introduced into the beam portion by means of non-metallic prestressing members <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> (or non-magnetic metallic prestressing members) passed through it in the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">When the prestressing force is introduced like this, a deformed amount in the final state can be reduced, and the withstandable load can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">As the non-metallic prestressing member <b>13</b>, a prestressing member made of a non-metallic material, such as a carbon fiber prestressing material, a glass fiber prestressing material, an aramide fiber prestressing material or the like is used. As the non-magnetic metallic prestressing member, a prestressing member made of a non-magnetic metal, such as authentic stainless steel prestressing member is used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">The support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>is a member to resist falling of the sidewall <b>11</b> and fixing the sidewall <b>11</b> to the floor slab <b>14</b>. The support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>is designed in a planar shape having a rectangular form as viewed in plane, and the prestressing force is introduced with the non-metallic prestressing members <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> passed therethrough in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">The support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>is provided with a plurality of through-holes <b>15</b><i>c </i>through which non-magnetic bolts <b>15</b><i>a </i>are to pass for fixing the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>to the floor slab <b>14</b>. The through-hole <b>15</b><i>c </i>is a cylindrical hole having an elliptical or oval shape as viewed in plane and passed through the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>in a thickness direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">The wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is a member connecting the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>with the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>. The wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is erected on the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>. A connecting portion between the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>is provided with a haunch having an almost triangular section for preventing stress concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The thickness of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>can be reduced to around &#xbc; of that of the sidewall made of the conventional reinforced concrete by forming the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the above fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>is formed such that its part projects inwardly of the guideway <b>10</b> from the upper end of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The coil <b>12</b> formed in a panel shape is attached to that inner side face of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>by means of fitting bolts <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">The reinforcing rib <b>11</b><i>d </i>is a member connecting a back face of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>with an upper face of the supporting base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>, and is arranged at opposite ends and intermediate portions of the wall portion <b>11</b> at a given interval as viewed in the extending direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reinforcing rib <b>11</b><i>d </i>is a planar member having a trapezoidal sectional shape as viewed in plane with its peripheral end face being fixed to the back face of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the upper face of the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>. The reinforcing rib portion <b>11</b><i>d </i>is erected such that it is almost orthogonal to the faces of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">Further, a position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> in this embodiment is a cloth bag formed in a bag-shaped shape. The mat is expanded by filling a filler <b>17</b> thereinto so as to positionally adjust the sidewall <b>11</b> placed on the mat.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">As the filler, a mortar-like material obtained by mixing cement as a main component, pozzalanic powder or fine sand, supper plasticizer and water. The filler <b>17</b> is converted to a non-shrinkable material having no self-shrinkability or no shrinkability in drying by mixing an expanding agent into the filler <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Further, a curing accelerator may be mixed to promote development of strength after curing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The filler <b>17</b> may be imparted with viscoelasticity by adding an asphalt emulsion or a rubbery polymer into the mortar material containing the cement as the main component, so that vibration of the sidewalls <b>11</b>, <b>11</b> can be suppressed when the superconducting Maglev 1 runs. Further, when the non-metallic fibers or non-magnetic metallic fibers having diameters of 0.01 to 0.2 mm and lengths of 3 to 16 mm are added to the above composition of the filler <b>17</b> in an amount of around 0.5 to around 3% of the entire volume, the filler can be converted to a material which can resist repeated loads and local tensile loads applied during the running of the superconducting Maglev 1.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">Further, in this embodiment, the non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>for fixing the sidewall <b>11</b> to the floor slab <b>14</b> is a bolt made of a non-magnetic metal such as stainless steel and having thread grooves engraved in one end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">Into the floor slab <b>14</b> are buried insert nuts <b>15</b><i>d </i>at positions opposed to the through-holes <b>15</b><i>c </i>when the side wall <b>11</b> is installed. The insert nut <b>15</b><i>d </i>is provided with screw grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">The sidewalls <b>11</b> are produced as precast members each having a unit length in a factory or the like, and carried to and installed in a construction site. Thus, the connection portions are formed between the sidewalls <b>11</b>, <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">A connecting member <b>18</b> to be arranged at the connecting portion is constituted by a central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>and two outer pipes <b>18</b><i>b</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>slidable along the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). The central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>is constituted by a shear member <b>18</b><i>d </i>resisting shearing force and an inner tube <b>18</b><i>c </i>covering the outer face of the shear member.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">The shear member <b>18</b><i>d </i>is a cylindrically shaped member made of the above-mentioned fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material, and is produced by charging this mixed material inside the non-metallic metal inner tube <b>18</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, the inner tube <b>18</b><i>c </i>and the shear member <b>18</b><i>d </i>are integrated as the central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">The central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>is inserted through outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>each having an inner diameter almost identical with the outer diameter of the inner tube <b>18</b><i>c</i>. Even if there is a gap of 1 mm or less, for example, between the outer peripheral face of the inner tube <b>18</b><i>c </i>and the inner peripheral face of the outer tube <b>18</b><i>b</i>, the outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b </i>can be slid along the central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">In addition, since the outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b </i>and the inner tube <b>18</b><i>c </i>are similarly made of the non-magnetic metal, magnetic resistance cannot be increased by the connecting member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Next, a method for installing the above sidewall <b>11</b> as well as the function of this embodiment will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Steps of a procedure for installing the sidewall <b>11</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Although omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ground coil <b>12</b> is attached to the sidewall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>by means of the fitting bolts <b>12</b><i>a </i>before the sidewall <b>11</b> is installed on the floor slab <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the empty position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> is placed on the upper face of the floor slab <b>14</b>, and then the sidewall <b>11</b> is placed on the mat. At this time, the sidewall <b>11</b> is placed such that a continuous hole may be formed between the through-hole <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the sidewall <b>11</b> and the insert nut <b>15</b><i>d </i>buried in the floor slab <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">When the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> is also positioned between the through-holes <b>15</b><i>c </i>and the insert nuts <b>15</b><i>d</i>, the position-adjusting mat having holes at corresponding portions is used. The holes are so formed that the filler <b>17</b> filled inside the mat may not leak through the holes.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), a pressure-bearing plate <b>15</b><i>b </i>is placed at a hole opening of the through-hole <b>15</b><i>c</i>, and the non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the through-hole <b>15</b><i>c </i>and the insert nut <b>15</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">The non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>is screwed into the screw grooves of the insert nut <b>15</b><i>d </i>such that the former may stand upright by itself. At this time, a gap is retained between the lower face of a screw head of the non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the upper face of the pressure-bearing plate <b>15</b><i>b</i>, so that the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>may be raised by this gap.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">Since the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> adjusts a height level by about 2 to about 6 cm, the gap corresponding to this may be retain between the lower face of the screw head and the upper face of the pressure-bearing plate <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The sidewall is located in this state according to a high-precision three-dimensional surveying technique, and the sidewall <b>11</b> is tentatively fixed to the floor slab <b>14</b> by means of the non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>or another means. After the sidewall <b>11</b> is tentatively fixed in this way, the filler <b>17</b> is charged into the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b>. When the filler <b>17</b> is charged under a pressure of about 10 to about 20 kPa, the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> can be closely contacted with the upper face of the floor slab <b>14</b> and the lower face of the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>, while fitting to uneven portions of these faces.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">A method for pouring the filler <b>17</b> under pressure, for example, a filling opening for a filler tube <b>17</b><i>a </i>is positioned to a higher position, and the filler is poured through the filing opening from a vessel <b>17</b><i>b </i>to apply a pressure head corresponding to the above higher position.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Height or inclination is adjusted by expanding the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b>, thereby adjusting the sidewall <b>11</b> to a precise position.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">Further, after the filler <b>17</b> is cured and preset strength is exhibited, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), the sidewall <b>11</b> is fixed to the floor slab <b>14</b> by tightening the non-magnetic bolt <b>15</b><i>a </i>under a specified control of torque.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">Since the sidewall <b>11</b> is installed such that the position of the sidewall <b>11</b> is positionally controlled at high precision by means of the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b>, a gap between the running superconducting Maglev 1 and the ground coil <b>12</b> can be always kept constant.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">Owing to this, it is possible to prevent the phenomenon that the electric power consumption will increase as the superconducting Maglev is spaced too largely from the ground coil or that the superconducting Maglev 1 or the ground coil <b>12</b> will be damaged as they approach too closely to each other. Further, since the positioning can be controlled easily at a high precision, construction workability is excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows loads P<b>1</b> and V acting upon the sidewall <b>11</b> and reaction forces Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> caused thereby, when the superconducting Maglev 1 runs.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">The horizontal load P<b>1</b> means alternate loads repeatedly applied to the sidewall <b>11</b> in inner/outer face directions thereof when the superconducting Maglev 1 passes. The vertical load V is a load acting in the vertical direction when the superconducting Maglev 1 passes.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">These loads P<b>1</b> and V cause the non-magnetic bolts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>arranged on inner and outer sides of the sidewall <b>11</b>, respectively to generate alternate reaction forces Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> pushing or pulling in the vertical directions.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a load P<b>2</b> occurring on the sidewall <b>11</b> as well as reaction forces Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> caused by the load P<b>2</b>, in emergency when this abnormality is caused in the superconductive magnet of the superconducting Maglev 1.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">In this embodiment, since the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>is longwise provided for the sidewall <b>11</b>, the sidewall can resist the load P<b>2</b> in emergency, and can always distributes the load P<b>1</b> and V in the extending direction.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">The load acting upon the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>is transmitted to the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the reinforcing rib portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>by the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">Further, the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>can prevent the sidewall <b>11</b> from falling with the horizontal loads P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b>, whereas the reinforcing rib portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>can resist the load which could not be borne by a corner portion at which the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c </i>intersect with each other, and a bending deformation amount of the wall portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>or the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>can be suppressed to a preset value or less.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">In the above, the method for installing each of the respective sidewalls <b>11</b> and its function. In the following, the connecting portions between the sidewall <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">The connecting member <b>18</b> is used to effect connection between the adjacent sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B. The sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B are each designed in a given length from the standpoint of rationality in transportation and installation. A plurality of such sidewalls <b>11</b>A, - - - are arranged in the extending direction of the guideway <b>10</b>, thereby constructing the guideway <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">Since the sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B such as long shaped members cannot ignore deformation due to changes in temperature, the sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B are arranged adjacent to each other, while a gap is ensured between them.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Connection holes <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>11</b><i>e </i>are formed respectively in the reinforcing ribs <b>11</b><i>d</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>provided at opposed end faces of the sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B thus arranged, and a hole passing the ribs in the extending direction is formed by overlapping the connection holes <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>11</b><i>e</i>. The connection holes <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>11</b><i>e </i>have a diameter of about 10 to about 15 cm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), a connecting member <b>18</b> is inserted through the penetrating connecting holes <b>11</b><i>e </i>and <b>11</b><i>e</i>. The connecting member <b>18</b> is positionally arrayed such that two outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be arranged in the respective connecting holes <b>11</b><i>e </i>and <b>11</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">Opposite ends of the connecting holes <b>11</b><i>e </i>and <b>11</b><i>e </i>are closed with molding frames <b>19</b><i>a</i>, - - - by bringing a direction in which the sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B extend or shrinks due to changes in temperature almost in conformity with a direction in which a central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the connecting member <b>18</b> slides inside the outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Further, a joining material <b>19</b> is poured into the gap defined between the outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>and the connecting holes <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>11</b><i>e </i>and closed by the molding frames <b>19</b><i>a </i>through pouring tubes <b>19</b><i>b</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>connected to the molding frames <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">As the joining material <b>19</b>, non-shrinkable cement-based mortar into which an expanding agent or curing accelerator is mixed, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">As mentioned above, the connecting member <b>18</b> is inserted through the connecting holes <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>11</b><i>e </i>formed slightly larger, and the sliding direction and the extending direction of the connecting member <b>18</b> (that is, the directions in which the sidewalls <b>11</b> expand or shrink) has only to be matched with each other by positionally aligning them. Consequently, the connecting portion can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the connecting member <b>18</b> can prevent the central shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>from the outer tubes <b>18</b><i>b</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>by projecting peeling-preventing pins <b>18</b><i>e</i>, <b>18</b><i>e </i>in a direction orthogonal to the central shaft portion near its opposite ends as viewed in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, even if the horizontal load P<b>2</b> acts upon the beam portion of only one of the sidewall <b>11</b>A for emergent situation, the load can be transmitted to the adjacent sidewall <b>11</b>B via the connecting member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">Therefore, sectional rigidity equivalent to that in the central portion can be ensured even at the end portions of the sidewalls <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, so that continuity between the sidewalls <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">Further, even if the sidewalls <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B expand with rises in temperature, temperature stress will not concentrate upon the connecting portion. Consequently, restraint stress due to temperature changes can be avoided, while the continuity is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">As explained above, according to the present embodiment, since no reinforcing steel bars are used in the sidewall <b>11</b> at all, the structure can be obtained with no magnetism or very small magnetic permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">Thus, although the sidewall <b>11</b> is desired to have small magnetic permeability, the magnetic permeability of the present sidewall <b>11</b> can be reduced. Consequently, the power consumption required for running the superconducting Maglev 1 can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">Furthermore, since expensive reinforcing steel bars unlike the non-magnetic reinforcement needs not be used, the invention is economical.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">Since no steel bar reinforcement is used, it is no need to control cover concrete thickness, and there is no fear that the sidewall <b>11</b> is deteriorated with rust of the steel bar reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">When prestressing force is introduced by means of the non-metallic prestressing member <b>13</b> or non-magnetic metallic member, cracking resistance or ultimate limit state loading can be enhanced. Even when the non-magnetic prestressing metallic member is used, the magnetic resistance will not be increased when the superconducting Maglev 1 runs, since the prestressing member is arranged in a deeper portion of the sidewall <b>11</b>, that is, at a position farther from the inner surface thereof as compared with the case with the steel bar reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">Moreover, since the thickness of the member can be made extremely thin, its weight can be reduced to not more than a half of the guideway made of the ordinary reinforced concrete guideway. Thus, when the guideway <b>10</b> is provided on a bridge, the size of bridge piers, fundamental structures of footing, piles, etc. can be reduced, and the total construction cost can be largely reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Since rigidity of the sidewall <b>11</b> is increased by using the above fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material and reinforcing the sidewall with the reinforcing rib portions <b>11</b><i>d</i>, the intrinsic cycle of the sidewall <b>11</b> becomes &#xbd; to &#x2153; of that of the conventional reinforced concrete sidewall. Consequently, occurrence of vibration during running the superconducting Maglev 1 can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Further, since the rigidity is high, deformation is small against the load. Thus, the superconducting Maglev 1 can be stably run.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">Since the above fiber-reinforced cement-based mixed material has good fresh property, the sidewall <b>11</b> having a complicated structure can be produced at a high precision without using a vibrator. Thus, it is no need to use an expensive molding frame having such high rigidity as being less susceptible to vibration which molding frame would be required to produce the reinforced concrete structure with high precision by using the vibrator. Therefore, the invention is economical.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">Since the positional adjustment can be effected by means of the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b>, the sidewall which is required to be positionally controlled at a high precision of 1 mm order can be easily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">The side walls <b>11</b>, - - - are installed while a gap is provided between them, and connection is realized between the sidewalls <b>11</b> by using the connecting members <b>18</b> slidable in the axial direction. Thus, the connecting portions which can cope with deformation due to temperatures, while maintaining dynamic continuity, can be easily constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122">Further, when a part of the sidewall <b>11</b> is damaged or when the ground coil <b>12</b> is exchanged, the sidewall in concern can be easily separated from the adjacent ones by removing the connecting member <b>18</b>. Furthermore, since the sidewall <b>11</b> can be disconnected from the floor slab <b>14</b> by loosing the non-magnetic bolts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, the sidewall <b>11</b> can be easily exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">The best mode of the present invention has been explained with reference to the drawings. Concrete constructions are not limited to this embodiment, and design changes will be included in the present invention so long as they do not depart from the gist of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">For example, according to the above embodiment, the non-metallic prestressing members <b>13</b> (or non-magnetic metallic prestressing members) are arranged in the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c</i>. However, such members need not be necessarily used. The prestressing member may be arranged in the beam portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>only.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">The way of fixing the sidewall <b>11</b> to the floor slab <b>14</b> is not limited to the non-magnetic bolts <b>15</b><i>a</i>. For example, it may be that lower ends of the non-metallic prestressing members are fixed inside the floor slab, and the upper ends are fixed to the upper face <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the support base seat <b>11</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">Further, the pouring of the filler <b>17</b> into the position-adjusting mat <b>16</b> under pressure may be performed with a pouring pump.</p>
