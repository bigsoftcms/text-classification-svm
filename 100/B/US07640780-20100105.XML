<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a tool comprising an extendable and retractable ram and, more particularly, to a system for controlling retraction of the ram.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Brief Description of Prior Developments</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,446,482 and 6,986,274 disclose battery powered hydraulic tool which comprises a ram. Normally, battery operated crimping tools employ a trigger-driven advance feature, in which the ram of the tool is advanced in order to crimp or press a connection together by forcing the ram of the tool into the head of the tool. With a connector between them, the connector is compressed or crimped by the movement of the ram. When the tool reaches a pre-determined internal pressure, an internal relief valve activates; preventing further pressure build-up within the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the crimp is complete, the user normally uses a trigger-driven retract feature. The trigger-driven retract feature, which either electromechanically or mechanically activates a release pin, returns the pressurized hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic fluid reservoir. When this occurs, the ram retracts to its original rear position with the aid of a spring pressing against the ram. The user can manipulate the trigger manually to minimize the amount of retraction by stopping the depression of the trigger at a certain time, but this can be tricky and inconsistent. There are tools known to the industry which employ mechanical &#x2018;stoppers&#x2019; that prevent ram retraction past a certain amount; the Huskies CN258 crimper for example. However, such devices are employed on self-contained or remote manual hydraulic tools; not on battery hydraulic tools.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need by users of battery powered crimping tools for a system for lengthening battery working life before recharging, and shortening crimp cycle timing. This is particularly acute for user who frequently crimp the same size of connector repeatedly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a compression tool is provided including a ram; a drive system, a battery and a user selectable retraction control. The drive system is connected to the ram to extend the ram and allow retraction of the ram. The battery is connected to the drive system to at least partially power the drive system. The user selectable retraction control is connected to the drive system. The user selectable retraction control includes a plurality of ram retraction settings which are adapted to be selected by a user to at least partially control respective different retraction stopping locations of the ram.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a hydraulically operated, battery powered electrical connector crimp tool is provided comprising a frame; a battery connected to the frame; a hydraulic drive system on the frame, wherein the hydraulic drive system comprises a hydraulic pump connected to the battery; a ram connected to the hydraulic drive system, wherein the ram is adapted to be extended on the frame by hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic drive system; and a system for retracting the ram on the frame from an extended position. The system for retracting the ram comprises a hydraulic fluid release system and a user selectable control. The user selectable control comprises a rotatable selector member on the frame which is adapted to be moved to select a retraction location of the ram from the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one method of the invention, a method of operating a hydraulically operated, battery powered electrical connector crimp tool is provided comprising extending a ram of the tool to an extended position; selecting a ram retraction setting on a user selectable control of the tool by a user, wherein the ram retraction setting at least partially determines an amount of retraction of the ram from the extended position; and retracting the ram from its extended position, wherein a location of stopping of the ram retraction from its extended position is at least partially controlled by the ram retraction setting selected by the user on the user selectable control.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing a hydraulically operated, battery powered electrical connector crimp tool is provided comprising providing the tool with a system for retracting a ram on the frame from an extended position, wherein the system for retracting the ram comprises a hydraulic fluid release system; and connecting a user selectable ram retraction control to a frame of the tool, wherein the user selectable ram retraction control comprises a plurality of ram retraction settings for stopping retraction of the ram from its extended position at a plurality of respective different ram retracted positions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a perspective view of a tool <b>10</b> for crimping an electrical connector onto a conductor. Although features of the invention will be described with reference to the exemplary embodiments shown in the drawings, it should be understood that features of the invention can be embodied in various different types of alternate embodiments. In addition, any suitable size, shape, or type of materials or elements can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tool <b>10</b> generally comprises a frame including a housing <b>12</b>, a compression head <b>14</b>, a drive system <b>16</b>, and a drive control system <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The drive system <b>16</b> generally comprises a hydraulic pressure system with a pump <b>24</b>, an electric motor <b>26</b>, and a battery <b>28</b>. The use of a hydraulic pressure system to move a ram is generally known in the art as seen by U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,679 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Instead of the manually actuated pump disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,679, the tool <b>10</b> uses the motor driven pump <b>24</b>. In a preferred embodiment the pump <b>24</b> is similar to that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,446,482 and 6,986,274 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. However, other types of pumps could be used. The hydraulic system includes a pressurized hydraulic reservoir <b>30</b> that the pump <b>24</b> can receive hydraulic fluid from and, which can receive hydraulic fluid from the compression head <b>14</b> as the ram <b>20</b> is being retracted. In the embodiment shown, the motor <b>26</b> is a high performance rare earth element permanent magnet motor manufactured by G.E.C.-Alsthom. However, in alternate embodiments, other types of motors could be used. The motor <b>26</b> is directly connected to the pump <b>24</b> without a gear transmission. The battery <b>28</b>, in the embodiment shown, is an 18 volt removable rechargeable Ni-MH battery yielding 2.6 amp-hours of charge. However, in alternate embodiments, other types of batteries or power sources could be used. The battery <b>28</b> has a latch <b>32</b> for snap latching and removing the battery from connection with the housing <b>12</b>. Located inside the housing <b>12</b> is a battery terminal <b>34</b> for making electrical connection with a connected battery.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The control system <b>18</b> generally comprises an activation trigger <b>36</b>, a hydraulic system pressure switch or sensor <b>38</b>, a release trigger <b>40</b>, and a printed circuit board <b>42</b>. The activation trigger <b>36</b> generally comprises a trigger member <b>44</b> and a microswitch <b>46</b>. The trigger member <b>44</b> is pivotably mounted to the housing <b>12</b>. A spring <b>48</b> is used to bias the trigger member <b>44</b> in a forward position. The trigger member <b>44</b> has a section <b>50</b> adapted to activate the microswitch <b>46</b> when the trigger member <b>44</b> is depressed by a user. The pressure sensor <b>38</b> is similar to the pressure sensor described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,679 with a spring loaded plunger <b>39</b> and a microswitch <b>41</b>. When the hydraulic system pressure reaches a predetermined pressure, such as about 6,000 psi for example, the plunger <b>39</b> is moved by the hydraulic fluid. The spring (not shown) is compressed and the microswitch <b>41</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The release trigger <b>40</b> is connected to a release valve <b>50</b> coupled to the hydraulic system. The release valve <b>50</b> allows hydraulic fluid to return from the ram cylinder to the hydraulic fluid reservoir when the release trigger <b>40</b> is manually actuated by a user. As noted above, the ram <b>20</b> is a spring loaded ram. It is spring loaded towards a retracted position. Hydraulic fluid can be pumped by the hydraulic drive system to the ram cylinder of the frame to overcome the bias of the spring and drive the ram forward to an extended position. When the hydraulic fluid is released through the valve <b>52</b>, the ram's spring can bias the ram from its extended position back towards its fully retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in addition to the hydraulic fluid release system <b>53</b>, the system <b>51</b> for retracting the ram on the frame from its extended position includes a user selectable control <b>54</b>. The user selectable control <b>54</b> includes a rotatable selector member <b>56</b> on the frame. The rotatable selector member <b>56</b> is adapted to be moved by a user to select a desired retraction location of the ram <b>20</b> from its extended position. In particular, the user selectable control <b>54</b> provides a limiting function to limit reward retraction of the ram <b>20</b> for providing a plurality of retraction locations. In the embodiment shown, the rotatable selector member <b>56</b> comprises a dial or collar on the frame of the tool. In an alternate embodiment, the user selectable control could comprise any suitable type of selection system for a user to select one of a number of possible setting. For example, a rotatable knob or lever could be provided, or a slidable selector switch, or an electronic user interface with buttons or a touch screen, or mechanical buttons, etc. Any suitable user input section for selecting a retraction location and/or connector could be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this embodiment the user selectable control <b>54</b> includes the controller <b>42</b> and a sensor <b>58</b>. The rotatable selector member <b>56</b> is operably coupled to the controller <b>42</b>. The rotatable selector member <b>56</b> is adapted to send a signal to the controller <b>42</b> based upon the position or setting of the dial <b>56</b>. The sensor <b>58</b>, in this embodiment, is adapted to sense a characteristic of the hydraulic fluid function. In particular, the sensor <b>58</b> is adapted to sense a percentage or quantity of hydraulic fluid returned through the retracting system back to the fluid reservoir. However, in an alternate embodiment, any suitable type of sensor could be provided, such as a sensor adapted to sense the position or location of the ram <b>20</b> on the frame for example. The sensor <b>58</b> is coupled to the controller <b>42</b> to send a signal corresponding to its sensed characteristic to the controller <b>42</b>. The controller <b>42</b> is also coupled to the release valve <b>52</b>. In this embodiment the release valve <b>52</b> is adapted to be manually opened by the user trigger <b>40</b> and either manually closed by release of the trigger and/or automatically closed by the controller <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the dial <b>56</b> has a plurality of markings or indicia <b>60</b>. The indicia <b>60</b> comprise electrical connector size and material indications, such as 1/0 Cu, 1/0 Al, 2/0 Cu, 2/0 Al, 4/0 Cu, etc. The frame or housing <b>12</b> has a master locator or selection indicator <b>62</b>. The dial <b>56</b> is rotated by the user to align one of the indicia <b>60</b> with the selection indicator <b>62</b> to thereby select that indicia as the ram retraction setting. In an alternate embodiment the selection indicator <b>62</b> could be on the dial and the indicia <b>60</b> could be on the frame or housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As noted above, the dial <b>56</b> is connected to the controller <b>42</b>. Position of the dial <b>56</b> signals the controller of the size of connector which is being crimped. The controller is adapted to determine or select a rear location of the ram retraction based upon the position of the dial. For example, for a small size connector, the ram is retracted from its extended position a distance less than the distance or retraction for a larger size connector. Thus, for the small size connector the location of the end of the ram retraction versus its fullest possible retraction position is much more than the location of the end of the ram retraction for the large size connector from the fullest possible retraction position (the fully open, fully retracted location of the ram). In a preferred embodiment, the dial is connected electromagnetically to a drain pin of the release valve <b>52</b>. However, it could be electromagnetically connected to a drain pin of another valve connected in series with the valve <b>52</b>. In one type of preferred system, the user selectable control is adapted to consistently release a percentage of fluid from the ram cylinder back to the fluid reservoir each time the release system is actuated; a different percentage for each one of the user selected settings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, a user would set the dial <b>56</b> to indicate the size and material of the connector to be crimped. The user would actuate the activation trigger <b>36</b>. The ram <b>20</b> is moved to an extended position on the frame to crimp the connector. Upon completion of the crimp, the user can actuate the release trigger <b>40</b>. In an alternate type of tool, the tool might comprise an automatic release cycle when a predetermined hydraulic pressure is reached such that the user does not need to actuate the release trigger <b>40</b>. The valve <b>52</b> can remain open until the controller <b>42</b> signals the valve <b>52</b> to close. The signal for the valve <b>52</b> to close will come from the controller <b>42</b> based upon the selected setting of the dial <b>56</b> and the characteristic(s) sensed by the sensor <b>58</b>. For example, if the dial is set for a 2/0 Cu connector, the controller <b>42</b> will signal the valve <b>52</b> to close when the characteristic(s) sensed by the sensor <b>58</b> corresponds to the preprogrammed or configured characteristic corresponding to a desired ram retraction position for a crimped 2/0 Cu connector to be removed and a new 2/0 Cu connector to be installed with minimal unnecessary retraction of the ram from its extended position. For example, retraction would be about &#x215d; inch for a 2/0 copper connector and about 1&#x215b; inch of retraction for a 500 kcmil copper connect. These are only some examples and should not be considered as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention is such that a user can, by rotating a dial that is integral to the battery tool, preset the limit of ram retraction by a certain amount. This can be selected by the user depending on the type of size of connector that is being crimped. The result is an exact amount of ram retraction after every crimp and activation of the release trigger. Battery consumption is minimized because the user needs only to advance the ram the minimum distance necessary in order to complete the remaining crimps; without having to waste battery power on advancing the ram a given distance prior to its contact with the connector it is intending to crimp.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The preferred embodiment of this invention would be a dial or collar that fits cylindrically over a portion of the back of the crimp head, or over the plastic housing of the battery tool. This dial, preferably, is engraved or imprinted with lines and numerals which are indicative of given wire or connector sizes and materials. It is commonly known that aluminum connectors usually have a much larger diameter for a given size conductor than a copper connector has. This is the case because aluminum is nominally 61 percent as conductive as copper for the same cross section and, therefore, aluminum conductors are sized larger in order to compensate for that limitation. So, aluminum connectors are larger than copper connectors for a given cross section of conductor (or, &#x201c;wire size&#x201d;). Therefore, the dial could be marked in order to compensate for the type of connector and the wire size of connector being crimped. As an example, the user would dial in &#x201c;250 CU&#x201d; to indicate that the user is connecting a copper connector sized for 250,000 circular mils (cmils) of copper conductor. Alternately, the user could dial in &#x201c;500 AL&#x201d; which would indicate that the user was connecting a 500,000 cmil conductor to a 500,000 cmil aluminum connector. The user could change to other connector sizes simply by rotating the dial, or could rotate the dial to a &#x2018;full&#x2019; or &#x2018;open&#x2019; position which would result in complete (or fully manual) ram retraction to its rearmost position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tick marks on the dial would correspond with a &#x201c;master&#x201d; tick mark on the crimp head or on the body of the tool. The alignment of the dial tick mark with the master tick mark could, underneath the dial, regulate an electronic switch mechanism or mechanical mechanism which would limit the amount of hydraulic fluid going to hydraulic fluid reservoir; which would thereby limit the retraction of the ram of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention allows for limiting ram retraction of the ram for user ease and optimization of battery life. This invention draws its need from users of battery powered crimping tools who frequently crimp the same size of connector repeatedly. Although the invention has been described in connection with a crimping tool, features of the invention could be used with a cutting tool as well as any other tool which used an extendable and retractable ram. Features of the invention could also be used in a pneumatic tool or an electrically actuated tool. For a hydraulic tool, the fluid reservoir could be located separate from the tool. Features of the invention could also be used in a non-battery operated tool, such as a hand operated tool. The retraction of the ram can be mechanically stopped, hydraulically stopped, and/or electrically stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an alternate embodiment a mechanically controlled system for limiting ram retraction could be provided. In this embodiment the ram <b>20</b>&#x2032; has grooves <b>64</b> along its length. The grooves <b>64</b> have different lengths. The selector member could comprise a pin <b>66</b> adapted to extend into one of the grooves <b>64</b>. The groove which the pin extends into would be dependent upon the rotational position of the selector member. When the ram <b>20</b>&#x2032; is retracted, the pin <b>66</b> could act as a stop against an end <b>68</b> of the selected groove to form a stop limit to the rearward retraction of the ram. Connecting channels <b>70</b> could be provided to allow full retraction without having to extend the ram to an extended position before full retraction was possible from one of the shorter grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
