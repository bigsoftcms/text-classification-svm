<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-001801 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Jan. 6, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an in-wheel motor, and particularly, to an in-wheel motor with high durability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A known conventional in-wheel motor drive scheme is to support a hollow motor by a motor suspension (for example, see WO02/083446 and Go Nagaya, Yasumichi Wakao and Akihiko Abe &#x201c;Development of an In-Wheel Motor with Advanced Dynamic-Damper Mechanism&#x201d;, the society of automotive engineers of Japan, Nov. 26, 2002, proceedings of conference No. 83-02, pp. 9-12). The hollow motor is coupled to a wheel of a wheel unit to rotate the wheel. The hollow motor is supported by the motor suspension so that it can vibrate in the vertical direction of the vehicle, and thus separated from the unsprung weight. The wheel is supported by a suspension arm to the vehicle. In this in-wheel motor drive scheme, when the wheel unit vibrates, the hollow motor receives the vibration of the wheel unit through the wheel and vibrates in the vertical direction of the vehicle. The vibration of the hollow motor cancels unsprung vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in order not to increase the volume of a motor, it is desirable to transmit output torque of the motor via a speed reducer to a wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, in a conventional in-wheel motor drive scheme, a geared motor is employed as the in-wheel motor, in which a hollow inner rotor type motor (motor) and a planetary speed reducer are integrally assembled in a motor case.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, the motor of the geared motor is a hollow inner rotor type motor, which includes a stator fixed to a non-rotary case provided on the outer side in the radial direction and a rotor fixed to a rotary case provided on the inner side in the radial direction. The non-rotary case is coupled to a knuckle that is a fixed portion, while the rotary case is coupled to a sun gear of the planetary speed reducer and rotatably connected to the shaft portion of the motor case.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the sun gear rotates as the rotor rotates, the rotation speed of the sun gear is converted and reduced to a speed corresponding to the orbital period of the planetary gear, and transmitted from a carrier to the shaft coupled to the output shaft of the speed reducer. The shaft has a universal joint coupling the output shaft of the planetary speed reducer and the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The geared motor is float-mounted to unsprung weight corresponding components that are a components around each wheel, and the rotation axis of the motor can swing in the radial direction independently of the rotation axis of the wheel unit. Thus, the mass of the motor functions as the mass of a so-called dynamic damper to cancel unsprung vibration when the vehicle runs over a bad road. As a result, the riding comfort of the vehicle is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the motor and the planetary speed reducer in a conventional geared motor are arranged in the following order from the wheel toward the vehicle body: the universal joint, the motor, and the planetary speed reducer. Then, the vibration of the wheel unit is transmitted, via the wheel and the universal joint, from the motor to the planetary speed reducer. Here, stress due to vibration of the wheel unit is applied to each of the motor and the planetary speed reducer. As this stress is greater proportionate to the distance from the wheel unit that is the source of vibration, a relatively great stress is applied to the planetary speed reducer that is located farthest from the wheel unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As known well, the planetary speed reducer has a structure where a plurality of gears are engaged, and hence stiffness thereof to the stress is relatively low. Accordingly, there has been a problem with the conventional in-wheel motor drive scheme that the durability of the in-wheel motor is impaired.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide an in-wheel motor with high durability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, an in-wheel motor is provided. The in-wheel motor includes: an electric motor generating motive power; a speed reducer arranged toward a wheel relative to the electric motor to reduce an output of the electric motor; and a rotation shaft arranged toward the wheel relative to the speed reducer to transmit an output of the speed reducer to the wheel. The rotation shaft is connected to a motive power transmission mechanism transmitting the motive power to the wheel.</p>

Ball <b>32</b> can move in the direction of the rotation shaft of shaft <b>110</b> along the grooves provided to wheel hub <b>20</b> and inner <b>31</b>. It is noted that constant velocity joint <b>30</b> is not specifically limited so long as it is a motive power transmission mechanism that transmits motive power of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> to wheel disc <b>10</b>. For example, a so-called flexible coupling may be employed as the motive power transmission mechanism, where a plurality of discs and the like are employed so that the in-wheel motor side and the wheel motor side are coupled to be eccentric to any directions.</p>

When brake pad <b>52</b> moves right on the drawing by brake piston <b>51</b>, brake pad <b>53</b> moves left on the drawing in response. Thus, the outer periphery of brake rotor <b>40</b> is pinched by brake pads <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, and brake is applied to motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Case <b>60</b> is arranged on the left of wheel hub <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

Pin <b>86</b> is supported by planetary carrier <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Oil pump <b>90</b> is provided at an end of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> toward wheel hub <b>20</b>, as connected to shaft <b>110</b>. As described above, shaft <b>110</b> is connected to inner <b>31</b> of constant velocity joint <b>30</b> and planetary carrier <b>84</b>, and rotatably supported by bearings <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As upper arm <b>210</b> and lower arm <b>220</b> are rotatably fixed to the vehicle body in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body and lower arm <b>220</b> is coupled to the vehicle body via shock absorber <b>230</b>, upper arm <b>210</b>, lower arm <b>220</b> and shock absorber <b>230</b> function as a suspension.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> and wheel supporting apparatus <b>200</b> seen from direction A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, upper arm <b>210</b> has two ends <b>210</b>A, <b>210</b>B, and fixed to the vehicle body by ends <b>210</b>A, <b>210</b>B to be rotatable in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Link <b>240</b> has its one end coupled to ball joint <b>170</b> (not shown). In accordance with the rotation force from the steering (handle) of the vehicle body, link <b>240</b> rotates motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> right or left relative to the traveling direction of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> is constituted by springs <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> that are a pair of elastic members provided in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body. A center portion <b>306</b> of dynamic mass damper <b>300</b> is attached to the outer circumferential face of case <b>60</b> of in-wheel motor <b>70</b>. An upper portion <b>310</b> of dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> is connected to knuckle <b>180</b> (<b>180</b>A). Upper portion <b>310</b> and center portion <b>306</b> are connected via spring <b>302</b>. Lower portion <b>312</b> of dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> is connected to knuckle <b>180</b> (<b>180</b>B). Center portion <b>306</b> and lower portion <b>312</b> are connected via spring <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An absorber (not shown) penetrating through center portion <b>306</b> is provided to upper portion <b>310</b> and lower portion <b>312</b>. The absorber has its one end fixed to center portion <b>306</b> and includes a shaft (not shown) that vibrates in the vertical direction in accordance with compression/expansion of springs <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. The absorber dampers the vibration of the shaft in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Wheel supporting apparatus <b>200</b> fixes dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> to case <b>60</b> of in-wheel motor <b>70</b>, and couples the suspension arms (upper arm <b>210</b> and lower arm <b>220</b>) to knuckle <b>180</b> and dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>400</b> by ball joints <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>, and thereby supports motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> to the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, wheel supporting apparatus <b>200</b> rotatably supports wheel disc <b>10</b> and wheel hub <b>20</b> by upper arm <b>210</b>, lower arm <b>220</b> and knuckle <b>180</b>, and supports in-wheel motor <b>70</b> by upper arm <b>210</b>, lower arm <b>220</b> and dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> so as to allow vibration in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> rotates in rotation direction DR<b>3</b> during traveling of the vehicle, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> rotates in rotation direction DR<b>4</b>. Then, torque rod <b>190</b> suppresses rotation of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> generated by rotation of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when an alternating current is supplied to stator coil <b>72</b> by a switching circuit (not shown) incorporated into the vehicle, rotor <b>73</b> rotates, and motor <b>65</b> outputs prescribed torque. Then, the output torque of motor <b>65</b> is transmitted to planetary gear <b>80</b> via sun gear shaft <b>81</b>. Planetary gear <b>80</b> changes the output torque from sun gear shaft <b>81</b> by sun gear <b>82</b> and pinion gear <b>83</b>, i.e., changes the speed (reduces the speed) and provides it to planetary carrier <b>84</b>. Planetary carrier <b>84</b> transmits the output torque of planetary gear <b>80</b> to shaft <b>110</b>, and shaft <b>110</b> rotates wheel hub <b>20</b> and wheel disc <b>10</b> by a prescribed rotation number via constant velocity joint <b>30</b>. Thus, motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> rotates by a prescribed rotation number, and the vehicle travels.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> receives vibration in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body during traveling of the vehicle due to the condition of the road and the like, springs <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> of dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> compress/expand in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle by in-wheel motor <b>70</b> that serves as the damper mass. By compression/expansion of springs <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, vibration in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is generated, which is out of phase relative to vibration due to force from the road surface to motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>. Specifically, dynamic damper mechanism <b>300</b> converts the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> into the vibration of in-wheel motor <b>70</b>. Here, to the vehicle body, vibration is transmitted that is the combination of the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> and the vibration of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> that is out of phase relative to that of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>. As the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> and that of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> are out of phase, an amplitude of the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> is reduced by that of the vibration of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> that is out of phase. Specifically, the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> is cancelled by the vibration of in-wheel motor <b>70</b>, and hardly transmitted to the vehicle body via upper arm <b>210</b> and lower arm <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body via constant velocity joint <b>30</b>. Specifically, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates arcing in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle around constant velocity joint <b>30</b>. The vibration in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is damped by the absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, an unsprung input from tire <b>250</b> is alleviated. Specifically, when motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> receives vibration due to the condition of the road surface and the like, vibration that cannot be covered by shock absorber <b>230</b> is absorbed by dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b>. Dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> allows in-wheel motor <b>70</b> to vibrate by vibration received by motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body with a different phase. As a result, dynamic mass damper mechanism <b>300</b> does not transmit great vibration to the sprung vehicle body. Accordingly, the riding comfort of the vehicle incorporating the wheel driven by in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is noted that in-wheel motor <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment of the present invention has the following three characteristics. With these characteristics, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is improved in its durability and reduced in size and weight. Additionally, the riding comfort of the vehicle incorporating in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Firstly, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is characterized in the function of shaft <b>110</b>. Specifically, shaft <b>110</b> functions to support in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrating in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body, allowing in-wheel motor <b>70</b> to pivot around the portion connecting shaft <b>110</b> and constant velocity joint <b>30</b>. Also, shaft <b>110</b> functions to transmit the output torque of motor <b>65</b>, which has its speed reduced by planetary gear <b>80</b> and thus increased in torque, to wheel disc <b>10</b> via constant velocity joint <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Here, when in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body in accordance with vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>, bending moment that effects in vertical direction DR<b>1</b> of the vehicle body is generated in shaft <b>110</b>. Thus, shaft <b>110</b> is required to have high strength as a supporting member of in-wheel motor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, as shaft <b>110</b> is connected to planetary carrier <b>84</b> to transmit the output torque of motor <b>65</b> that has been converted to high torque, shaft <b>110</b> is required to have high strength as a motive power transmission member. Thus, shaft <b>110</b> is required to have high strength as the supporting member of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> and as the motive power transmission member. According to the present invention, two members each required to have high strength can be integrated into a single shaft <b>110</b>. Thus, components required to have high strength can be unified to reduce in-wheel motor <b>70</b> in size and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Secondly, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is characterized in its arrangement as to motor <b>65</b> and planetary gear <b>80</b> accommodated in case <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, inside case <b>60</b><i>b</i>, planetary gear <b>80</b> is arranged toward wheel disc <b>10</b> relative to motor <b>65</b>. Then, planetary gear <b>80</b> has planetary carrier <b>84</b> connected to shaft <b>110</b>. Further, shaft <b>110</b> is fitted to inner <b>31</b> of constant velocity joint <b>30</b>. Thus, in in-wheel <b>70</b>, motor <b>65</b> and planetary gear <b>80</b> are arranged in the following order, from the vehicle body side toward the wheel disc <b>10</b> side: motor <b>65</b>, planetary gear <b>80</b>, and constant velocity joint <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When unexpected external force is applied to motor-driven wheel <b>100</b>, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates greatly. When in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates greatly, stress due to the vibration is applied also to motor <b>65</b> and planetary gear <b>80</b> accommodated as integrated in case <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Here, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> vibrates to arc around constant velocity joint <b>30</b>, and therefore the magnitude of the stress applied to motor <b>65</b> and planetary gear <b>80</b> increases proportionally to the distance from constant velocity joint <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is noted that, in a conventional in-wheel motor, as the planetary gear is arranged toward the vehicle body than the motor is arranged, the stress applied to the planetary gear is greater than that applied to the motor. On the other hand, as the planetary gear has a structure in which a plurality of gears are engaged, it is lower than the motor in durability against the stress. Accordingly, there has been a problem with the conventional in-wheel motor that the durability is impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In contrast, in in-wheel motor <b>70</b> of the present invention, planetary gear <b>80</b> is arranged toward wheel disc <b>10</b> relative to motor <b>65</b>. Thus, planetary gear <b>80</b> is arranged in a position in the rotation shaft direction that is closer to constant velocity joint <b>30</b> as compared to the conventional planetary gear, and therefore the stress applied to planetary gear <b>80</b> is reduced. Accordingly, durability of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thirdly, in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is characterized in its fixing method to case <b>60</b> of planetary gear <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged view of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, planetary gear <b>80</b> is accommodated in case <b>60</b><i>b </i>with motor <b>65</b>. Here, ring gear <b>85</b> located at the outermost circumference of planetary gear <b>80</b> is fixed so that its side face in the rotation shaft direction abuts to the inner face of case <b>60</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Then, case <b>60</b><i>a </i>and case <b>60</b><i>b </i>are coupled at faces perpendicular to the rotation shaft direction of shaft <b>110</b>. A dot-and-dashed line DL in the drawing shows a junction plane between case <b>60</b><i>a </i>and case <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Here, ring gear <b>85</b> is fixed to case <b>60</b><i>b </i>so that its end face perpendicular to the rotation shaft direction abuts to an end face perpendicular to the rotation shaft direction of case <b>60</b><i>a</i>. Thus, ring gear <b>85</b> has its rotation shaft direction position fixed by case <b>60</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Normally, in order to regulate positional displacement in the rotation shaft direction of motor components due to inertial force in the rotation shaft direction, a snap ring is employed in assembling the motor components. For example, when a snap ring is employed to fix ring gear <b>85</b> to case <b>60</b><i>b</i>, a groove for fitting the snap ring is provided in advance to the inner circumferential face of case <b>60</b><i>b</i>, and the snap ring is fitted therein. Then, by assembling ring gear <b>85</b> to abut to the snap ring, ring gear <b>85</b> is fixed to case <b>60</b><i>b </i>so that the rotation shaft direction position is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, such a fixing method requires an allowance in the length of the rotation shaft direction of case <b>60</b><i>b </i>so that the groove for assembling the snap ring is provided. Therefore, the length of case <b>60</b><i>b </i>is increased in the rotation shaft direction, and thus the space formed at in-wheel motor <b>70</b> on the vehicle body side is narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, the present embodiment employs a structure where ring gear <b>85</b> has its rotation shaft direction end face abutted to case <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and the rotation shaft direction position of ring gear <b>85</b> is fixed by case <b>60</b><i>a</i>. Thus, as assembling of the snap ring is not required, the length of in-wheel motor <b>70</b> in the rotation shaft direction can be reduced. As a result, the space formed at in-wheel motor <b>70</b> on the vehicle body side is enlarged, whereby the assembly position of shock absorber <b>230</b> to lower arm <b>220</b> can be moved toward wheel disc <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, in lower arm <b>220</b>, a ratio (=AL<b>1</b>/AL) of a distance AL<b>1</b> between a fixing position to the vehicle body (corresponding to rotary center of lower arm <b>220</b>) and an assembling position of shock absorber <b>230</b> and a distance AL between a fixing position of the vehicle body and a coupling position to motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> (corresponding to the arrangement position of ball joint <b>170</b>) is referred to as an arm ratio. As the arm ratio is greater, that is, as distance AL<b>1</b> is longer, the absorption efficiency of the vibration of motor-driven wheel <b>100</b> in the suspension is higher.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In in-wheel motor <b>70</b> according to the present invention, shock absorber <b>230</b> can be moved toward wheel disc <b>10</b> as in-wheel motor <b>70</b> is reduced in size in the rotation shaft direction by the above described third characteristics. In other words, distance AL<b>1</b> can be increased. Thus, the arm ratio in lower arm <b>220</b> is increased, and the riding comfort of the vehicle is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As above, according to the present invention, the in-wheel motor that is small in size and weight and that has high durability can be implemented. Additionally, the suspension can be improved to improve the riding comfort of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
