No. 10/435,752, filed May 9, 2003, and entitled &#x201c;Multi-Material Vertical Form, Fill and Seal Produce Bag,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to bag filling methods, and more specifically to a method of simultaneously forming and filling bags formed from multi-substrate sheets or webs. The sheets include strips of a polymeric film and a ventilating polymeric mesh connected to one another along a longitudinal seam. The bags are filled to a method of simultaneously forming and filling using a vertical form, fill and seal machine and to the sheet used to form the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fruits, vegetables, and other items are often stored and sold in bags in order to offer a number of the items for sale in a single prepackaged configuration. The typical bag is also intended for point-of-purchase use and, therefore, also serves as a marketing material for its contents. It is therefore desirable to configure a bag such that its contents can be viewed by prospective purchasers without opening the bag. A plastic film is ideal for this purpose because it is transparent. It also can easily receive printed indicia that may identify the items, their source, and/or other information. Separate printed labels are also easily adhered to plastic film bags. Because a plastic film is flexible, low cost, and easily heat sealed to itself and other materials, plastic film bags can be manufactured and filled relatively easily and inexpensively.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, traditional plastic films such as low density polyethylene (LDPE) have relatively low gas permeability. They are therefore poorly suited for storing items that must be exposed to the ambient air or &#x201c;breathe&#x201d; in order to prevent premature spoilage. For this reason, many produce items, such as apples, onions, and oranges, were traditionally stored and sold in bags from a woven or knit mesh material, such as a polymeric mesh material, that provides sufficient ventilation to prevent premature spoilage of the produce items contained in the bag. The polymeric mesh allows sufficient air to flow into and out of the bag to properly ventilate the produce contained within the bag and prevent spoilage. The bags are normally formed to have polymeric film strips attached across the top of the bag to form a more reliable seal for the bag and prevent premature opening of the bag, as well as to provide a surface on which printed matter can be located on the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mesh bags have disadvantages, however. The items stored in the bags cannot be easily seen by prospective purchasers. The side and bottom seams of the bags also tend to be relatively weak because the seams do not contain enough material to strongly bond the edges to one another. Indicia also cannot be easily printed directly onto the mesh material. It is therefore necessary in many instances to apply separate polymeric film strips to ends and/or sides of the bag to reinforce the seam and enclose the bag. A separate film strip may also need to be applied to one side of an all-mesh bag for the purposes of receiving the desired display indicia. However, this separate strip actually hinders the viewing of items in the bag. It also adds to the cost of the bag because it requires an additional manufacturing step for its application or at least the provision of an additional strip-applying station on a bag making machine. A bag having these characteristics is disclosed in Antonacci et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,683, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many of the problems addressed above are overcome by so-called &#x201c;half-and-half&#x201d; bags. A half-and-half bag has a front panel or &#x201c;half&#x201d; formed from a polymeric film and a rear panel or &#x201c;half&#x201d; formed from a polymeric mesh material. The mesh half provides ample ventilation for the stored items. The film half can receive printed indicia and also can be easily heat bonded to other film materials. The film material can also be securely heat bonded to itself and to the mesh material. Hence, half-and-half bags combine the advantages of all mesh bags and all film bags.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Half-and half bags are formed in a continuous bag making machine from a pair of sheets formed from a polymeric mesh and a polymeric film, respectively. The sheets are unwound from respective rolls and fed concurrently through a bag making machine in an overlying relationship, where they are heat-bonded to one another at their mating edges. The sheets are then folded over while other strips of the polymeric film are attached to the sheets at appropriate locations. The sheets are then cut into longitudinal strips and sealed at the bottom edge to form an open-topped bag. After the bags are completed, they are shipped to a supplier, who fills the bags with items and closes the bags, often by heat sealing the tops using a sealing strip formed from an extension of the film panel. A half and half bag of this general type is disclosed, e.g, in Fox et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,489, which is herein incorporated by reference. A machine and method for producing a bag of this general type is commercially available from Hudson Sharp.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Of course, making and filling bags in two steps using two different machines adds considerable cost to the end product. In an attempt to reduce this cost, it is also known in the prior art to form a bag from a continuous sheet, fill it with items, and seal its side and bottom edges&#x2014;all in one operation using a so-called &#x201c;form, fill, and seal&#x201d; machine. One such machine and its method of operation are described in Pelster et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,091,595, incorporated herein by reference. In the Pelster et al. '595 patent, a sheet or net of a polymeric netting is pulled over a hollow tube to form a sleeve, and the bottom of the sleeve is sealed and filled with a number of items. The bottom of the sleeve is then indexed down beneath the tube. The top of the thus-formed bag is then sealed to form a filled polymeric mesh bags. The cost of forming and filling such a bag is considerably less than the combined costs of forming and filling more traditional net bags. However, the resulting bag has all of the disadvantages of a traditional mesh bag, including lack of an indicia-receiving surface and relatively weak seams. Thus, any labeling that is to be placed on the bag must be placed on the bag after sealing of the bag, or on a lower closure that is separately applied to the bag during sealing in order to form a lower seal for the bag in a manner similar to the other prior art mesh bags discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method of forming and filling bags using a low cost bag material which is preformed of continuous sheet or web containing one or more strips of a polymeric mesh material and a number of strips of a polymeric film or labeling material. The web should be one that can be converted in a continuous form, fill and seal machine to form a filled bag for sale to a consumer immediately after removal from the machine. It is also desirable that the web be capable of forming a bag that has sufficient seam strength to securely retain a number of items within the bag, even during rough handling of the bag.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, a method of forming and filling a bag is provided. A web for a bag includes both polymeric mesh and printable polymeric film strips and that can be utilized with conventional or customized form, fill and seal bag making and filling machines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the strips of the polymeric mesh material and the strips of the polymeric film material are heat sealed or otherwise secured to one another in order to form a continuous multi-substrate sheet or web that can be formed and filled in a form, fill, and seal machine to produce a bag having adequate ventilation and labeling capabilities. The form of the sheet can be modified as necessary to include any number or orientation of the polymeric mesh strips and polymeric film strips desired. The strips are secured to one another in an overlapped configuration that enables the film strip to be located completely on the exterior or interior surface of the bag in order to increase the strength of the finished bag.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sheet so formed can be converted in a conventional or customized form, fill and seal machine such that the sheet will form a bag incorporating 1) one or more mesh material strips to provide adequate ventilation to the items held within the bag, and 2) one or more printable film strips capable of retaining printed material on the bag and permitting easy viewing of the items stored in the bag. The strips of polymeric film and polymeric mesh may be altered in width relative to one another to form various proportions of the overall surface area of the finished bag in order to form bags of different configurations as desired for different uses. The strips of different sheets may also be formed at different locations relative to the longitudinal centerline of the sheets in order to vary the percentage of a given bag that is mesh or film as desired for different uses. Further, depending upon the particular configuration of the mesh and film strips on the sheet, the form, fill and seal machine can be adjusted in its configuration to form the sheet into a bag having one side formed entirely of the mesh material and one side formed entirely of the film material. The formed bag can also be formed to include gussets if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sheet may also include separate labeling strips applied to the polymeric mesh strips in order to provide additional printing surfaces for the resulting bags.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Various other features, embodiments and alternatives of the present invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description taken together with the drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration and not limitation. Many changes and modifications could be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With regard now to the drawing figures in which like reference numerals designate like parts throughout the disclosure, a roll <b>30</b> formed from a continuous sheet or web <b>32</b> constructed in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The sheet or web <b>32</b> is of a multi-substrate construction. It includes a continuous strip <b>34</b> of a polymeric mesh material and a continuous strip <b>36</b> of a polymeric film material bonded to one another at a seam <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The polymeric mesh strip <b>34</b> is formed of an open fiber mesh fabric. The open mesh fabric may be formed from any open mesh material to which a thermoplastic film strip can be heat bonded to form a seam that is sufficiently strong for use as form, fill, and seal bags. Preferably, the open mesh fabric also is suitable for processing into bags using high speed bag-making equipment. Woven, knit, scrim, aperated, and extruded net materials are suitable for this purpose and nonwoven fabrics can be used provided they have sufficient openness of construction to allow adequate visibility of a bag's contents. Suitable woven, knit, or scrim fabrics may be formed from tapes or slit-film ribbon yams. The yarns of the fabric or such yarns and any coatings will generally comprise a thermoplastic resin composition. It also is contemplated to form the fabric or coated fabric from thermoplastic resin compositions having different melting points, with a higher melting resin being present to provide strength and integrity to the fabric and a lower melting resin being present, either as a discontinuous coating on the surface of the fabric or laminated to or as part of the yarns thereof, e.g., as coextruded tapes, to provide for heat bonding of the yarns of the fabric to one another and, in turn, greater dimensional stability and resistance to fraying. Like considerations are applicable to scrims.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Nonwoven netlike fabrics, extruded nets and scrims are also suitable as open mesh fabrics for the mesh fabric strip <b>34</b>. These materials typically have a reticulated or netlike structure, with a plurality of interconnected, intersecting fibrils or ribs defining a plurality of open spaces in the fabric. A material suitable for this purpose is commercially available under the brand-name CLAF&#xae;, which is a cross-laminated nonwoven fabric made from coextruded film that has been split and stretched. CLAF&#xae; material and its characteristics are described in more detail, e.g, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,929,303 and 5,182,162. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,303, the open mesh CLAF&#xae; fabric is suitable for joining with other materials, such as papers, films, foils, foams and other materials, by lamination or extrusion coating techniques, or by sewing or heat sealing. CLAF&#xae; is available from Nisseki CLAF, Inc., with examples of product designations including CLAF S, CLAF SS, CLAF HS and CLAF MS. Such fabrics are available in various styles and weights. The style designated MS is a preferred fabric for the invented bags. MS style CLAF&#xae; has a basis weight of about 18 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and a thickness of approximately 7.8 mils, as determined by ASTM D3776 and ASTM 01777, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The polymeric film strip <b>36</b> of the web <b>32</b> is formed of a suitable synthetic resin film material, preferably a low density polyethylene (LDPE). The thermoplastic film to which the open mesh fabric of the invented bags is heat sealed to form longitudinal seams comprises at least one thermoplastic resin composition having a melting or softening point that is lower than that of the open mesh fabric. In the case of open mesh fabrics composed of two or more resin compositions with different melting temperatures, the film resin preferably melts at a temperature lower than the higher melting component of the mesh fabric. Preferably, the melting point of the film resin is at least about 10&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the mesh fabric resin of the strip <b>34</b> to facilitate heat sealing without melting or softening of the mesh fabric. More preferably, the melting point differential is about 30&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C. The resin of the film should also provide sufficient seal strength and adhesion so that the bags hold product without breaking or failure at or adjacent to the seams during filling, handling and use. Preferably, the open mesh fabric and thermoplastic film are composed of resins and so configured as to provide longitudinal seams having a strength of at least about 5 lb/in<sup>2 </sup>as measured by ASTM D 5035-95. More preferably, seam strength is at least about 8 lb/in<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The choice of thermoplastic resin for the film strip <b>36</b> depends in part upon the amount of heat and pressure that can be applied thereto at the side seam of the open mesh bag without impacting the integrity of the bag. The resin for the film will also depend on the choice of resin for the open mesh fabric. The thermoplastic resin may be a single resin or a blend of two or more compatible resins. In the case where HDPE is used as the higher melting temperature component of the mesh fabric strip <b>34</b>, the thermoplastic film strip <b>36</b> is preferably formed of an ethylene alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer or blend of compatible polymers having a melting temperature below that of HDPE. The thermoplastic synthetic polymer resins may contain additives such as stabilizers, dyes, pigments, anti-slip agents, foaming agents and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In greater detail, the film strip <b>36</b> can be secured to the fabric strip <b>34</b> using any technique effective to provide a strong enough bond between the fabric strip <b>34</b> and the film strip <b>36</b> to stand up to downstream bagmaking steps. Preferably, the film strip <b>36</b> is heat sealed to the fabric strip <b>34</b> to form the seam <b>41</b> using a sealing roller or other film application equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the polymeric mesh strip <b>34</b> has an outer edge <b>35</b> and a longitudinal edge <b>38</b> that is thermally bonded to a corresponding longitudinal edge <b>40</b> disposed on the polymeric film strip <b>36</b> opposite an outer edge <b>37</b> for the film strip <b>36</b> such that the mesh strip <b>34</b> and film strip <b>36</b> overlap one another a specified distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; in order to provide the seam <b>41</b> with adequate strength to the bond between the strips <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> such that the web or sheet <b>32</b> can function adequately when formed into a bag for storing produce or other items. By securing the mesh strip <b>34</b> to the film strip <b>36</b> in this configuration, the strength of the bond between the mesh strip <b>34</b> and film strip <b>36</b> is further enhanced regardless of the amount of overlap due to the integral form of the seam <b>41</b>. This is because the film strip <b>36</b> is softened upon heating to the point where the film strip <b>36</b> can surround the overlapped portion of the mesh section <b>34</b>. When cooled, the mesh strip <b>34</b> is contained at least partially within the film strip <b>36</b> to form a unitary structure for the seam <b>41</b>. The width &#x201c;D&#x201d; of the overlap can be varied between one-eighth of an inch to one-and-a-half inches, depending upon the particular use to which the sheet <b>32</b> will be put. For example, in situations where the sheet <b>32</b> will be used to form a bag which will hold heavy items such as grapefruit, the width D will be greater. Conversely, wherein the bag formed from the sheet <b>32</b> is configured to hold lighter items such as small onions, the width D will be less. A particularly preferred range of overlap D is between a quarter (&#xbc;) inch to one-half (&#xbd;) inch. Further, the longitudinal edge <b>38</b> of the mesh strip <b>34</b> is preferably bonded on the surface of the film strip <b>36</b> which will constitute an interior surface of the finished bag, such that the edge <b>38</b> of the mesh strip <b>34</b> cannot be contacted by exterior surfaces and inadvertently separated from the film strip <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To thermally bond the heat sealable film strip <b>36</b> to the mesh strip <b>34</b>, the film strip <b>36</b> and fabric strip <b>34</b> are subjected to sufficient heat and pressure to soften or melt at least the film strip <b>36</b> to effect a heat-seal between them. Temperatures and pressures effective to provide the heat-seal will depend in part on the particular thermoplastic film and open mesh fabric used in making the open mesh bag as well as the thicknesses of the film strip <b>36</b> and fabric strip <b>34</b>. The applied heat and pressure, of course, should not be so great as to destroy the integrity of the bag. In a preferred embodiment of the inventive process, wherein a MS grade CLAF&#xae; fabric and an ethylene alpha-olefin polymer such as Affinity PF 1140 or blends thereof with polyethylenes for the heat sealable film were utilized, temperatures of about 200&#xb0; to 450&#xb0; F., and more typically 300&#xb0; to 400&#xb0; F. and pressures of about 15 to 80 psi, and more typically 40 to 60 psi provide an effective heat seal even at short heating times on the order of one-half second or less. In heat sealing the heat sealable film strip <b>36</b> and the open mesh fabric strip <b>34</b> at the seam <b>41</b> to form the sheet <b>32</b>, any suitable heat seal device can be used. Seal bars could be employed, but a continuous motion sealer, or a heated drum sealer is preferred because they each permit the strips <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> to be sealed to one another in a continuous process. Other binding, securing, or attachment techniques could also be used in place of heat sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The relative widths and locations of the strips <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> on the sheet <b>32</b> will depend upon the amount of ventilation required and other factors. For example, the respective percentages of the sheet <b>32</b> can be between 70% of the mesh strip <b>34</b> and 30% of the film strip <b>36</b>, and 70% of the film strip <b>36</b> and 30% of mesh strip <b>34</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the sheet <b>32</b> is formed having 60% of the mesh strip <b>34</b> and 40% of the film strip <b>36</b>. This proportion assures that the front face of a finished non-gusseted bag is formed from film and that the rear face is formed from mesh, leaving an entire face available for printing and viewing while the remainder of the bag is well-ventilated. Instead of or in addition to selecting a particular proportion of mesh and film strips in the sheet <b>32</b>, it is also possible to select the position of the seam <b>41</b> relative to the longitudinal centerline of the web <b>32</b> in order to achieve the desired effect. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment, the seam <b>41</b> is positioned so that it coincides with and forms a side seam <b>57</b> of the finished bags. Other seam locations are also conceivable, however.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As the sheet <b>32</b> is formed, preferably in a continuous process as is known in the art, the sheet <b>32</b> is wound onto a core to form a roll <b>30</b> that can be utilized with a generally conventional or customized form, fill and seal machine. A variety of machines are available for this purpose including both continuous and intermittent vertical form, fill, and seal machines and continuous and intermittent horizontal form, fill, and seal machines. Currently, the preferred machine used to convert the sheet is an intermittent vertical form, fill and seal machine. Machines of this type are well known in the art, such as the machine disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,255,497, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference. One such machine <b>42</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The machine <b>42</b> includes a frame <b>44</b> which supports a roll <b>30</b>, a product dispenser <b>46</b>, and a vertical bag forming and filling tube <b>48</b>. The product dispenser <b>46</b> functions to dispense batches of items such as produce items that have been weighed by a computer-weighing apparatus (not shown) at the proper time in the operating cycle of the machine <b>42</b>. Suitable computer-weighing apparatuses that can perform this function are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,538,693 and 4,901,807, which are incorporated herein by reference. As is known in the art, the product dispenser <b>46</b> receives batches of produce from the weighing machine and dispenses each batch at the appropriate point in the form, fill, and seal cycle to assure that all of the produce in a given batch falls into the associated bag <b>43</b> after the bag's sides are formed but before its top is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tube <b>48</b> is mounted on the frame <b>44</b> immediately below the dispenser <b>46</b>, such that produce <b>47</b> dispensed from the dispenser <b>46</b> falls through the interior of the vertical forming tube <b>48</b> and into a bag <b>43</b> positioned beneath the tube <b>48</b>. The vertical forming tube <b>48</b> includes a mounting plate <b>50</b> that cooperates with corresponding mounting structures (not shown) on the frame <b>44</b> to facilitate convenient and properly aligned mounting of the tube <b>48</b> to the frame <b>44</b>. Looking now at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a forming shoulder <b>52</b> is secured to the frame <b>44</b> by a mounting device <b>54</b> located adjacent but spaced from an upper end of the tube <b>48</b>. As is conventional, the forming shoulder <b>52</b> wraps around the upper end of the forming tube <b>48</b> and is open at the front end.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the roll <b>30</b> described previously is mounted on the frame <b>44</b> such that the sheet <b>32</b> can be drawn from the roll <b>30</b> as the roll <b>30</b> rotates. Idler and tensioning rollers <b>53</b> are positioned to unwind the sheet <b>32</b> from the roll and maintain tension on the sheet as it is drawn from the roll <b>30</b> to the forming shoulder <b>52</b>. A vertical sealing device <b>56</b> is supported adjacent the front end of the tube <b>48</b> below the front opening of the forming shoulder <b>52</b>. The vertical sealing device <b>56</b> aligns each of the outer edges <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> of the sheet <b>32</b>, presses the edges <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> together in an overlapping fashion, and thermally bonds them together to form an overlap seal resulting in a vertical side seam <b>57</b> of a generally tubular sleeve <b>58</b>. As is generally known in the art, an overlap seal is one in which an inner surface of one edge is bonded to an outer surface of the other edge to which it is bonded. In the present case, the overlap seal results in the inner surface of the edge of film side <b>76</b> of the bag being bonded to an outer surface of the edge of the mesh side <b>74</b> as clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Seam <b>41</b>, described above, also is formed from an overlap seal and shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A fin seal could alternatively be formed with a minor modification to the same machine. The device <b>56</b> may be a slotted, heated bar as shown, a pair of facing heated bars, or a pair of heated rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Two pairs of advancing belts <b>59</b> (only one is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are located on opposite sides of the vertical forming tube <b>48</b> for engagement with the sleeve <b>58</b>. The advancing belts <b>59</b> are activated by a controller <b>60</b> of the machine <b>42</b> at the appropriate point in the machine's cycle to index the sleeve <b>58</b> the length of one bag <b>43</b> to unroll a corresponding length of the sheet <b>32</b> from the roll <b>30</b> and into contact with the forming shoulder <b>52</b> and the tube <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In order to ensure that the top of the sleeve <b>58</b> is opened sufficiently wide to receive product <b>47</b> dispensed from the product dispenser <b>46</b> through the forming tube <b>48</b>, a spreader attachment <b>62</b> is mounted to the lower end of the forming tube <b>48</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the spreader attachment <b>62</b> includes a pair of spreader fingers <b>64</b> mounted to opposite sides of the forming tube <b>48</b>. Each spreader finger <b>64</b> includes a base <b>66</b> releasably mounted within the forming tube <b>48</b>, and an extension <b>68</b> extending downwardly and outwardly from the lower end of the forming tube <b>48</b>. As the sleeve <b>58</b> of the web <b>32</b> moves downwardly past the lower end of the forming tube <b>48</b>, the extension <b>68</b> of each spreader finger <b>64</b> urges the sleeve <b>58</b> outwardly such that the sleeve <b>58</b> has a sufficient diameter to accept and retain the produce <b>47</b> dispensed through the tube <b>48</b> by the dispenser <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The machine <b>42</b> further includes a conventional end sealing and cutting device <b>70</b> located below the lower end of the spreader attachment <b>66</b>. The device <b>70</b> is controlled by the controller <b>60</b> to horizontally compress the sleeve <b>58</b> above the level of the produce <b>47</b> and heat the sleeve <b>58</b> to simultaneously form a lateral top seam <b>71</b> on the bag <b>43</b> containing the produce <b>47</b> and a lateral bottom seam <b>72</b> on the next bag <b>43</b> to be filled with the produce <b>47</b>. The seams <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> are formed similarly to the seam <b>57</b> in that the film strip <b>36</b> is softened upon heating and is compressed to surround the aligned portion of the mesh strip <b>34</b> to form an integral structure for the seams <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>. However, because the sealed edges do not overlap but instead merely abut one another, the resulting seal is a so-called peel seal or fin seal rather than an overlap seal. The device <b>70</b> also includes a blade (not shown) that functions to sever the filled and sealed bag <b>43</b> from the remainder of the substrate sleeve <b>58</b> such that the filled and sealed bag <b>43</b> falls downwardly onto a conveyor <b>73</b>, which carries the filled and sealed bag <b>43</b> to a separate packaging location. A third seal bar (not shown) could be added to or incorporated with the seal bar <b>70</b> to form a third lateral seam beneath the seam <b>71</b>. Punches may be placed in the third seal bar to punch holes between the second and third lateral seams for hanging or carrying the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The form, fill and seal machine <b>42</b> as described herein is conventional except for one important difference. Specifically, the end sealing and cutting device <b>70</b> is shifted 90&#xb0; with respect to the design of conventional vertical form, fill and seal machines. Hence, as is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sealing device <b>56</b> is located generally over one of the ends of the sealing and cutting device <b>70</b> as opposed to generally over the center of device <b>70</b>, and the seam <b>57</b> formed by the sealing device <b>56</b> extends in parallel to the seams <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> formed by the sealing and cutting device as opposed to perpendicularly to them. The &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; orientation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and discussed below. By orienting the device <b>70</b> in this manner, the top lateral seam <b>71</b> and the bottom lateral seam <b>72</b> on each bag <b>43</b> are located relative to the side seams <b>41</b> and <b>57</b> such that the mesh strip <b>34</b> forms the entire rear of the bag <b>43</b>, the film strip <b>36</b> forms the entire front side of the bag <b>43</b>, and the side seams <b>41</b> and <b>57</b> are at the sides of the bag <b>43</b> rather than the center. More specifically, looking now at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, a finished bag <b>43</b> formed utilizing the machine <b>42</b> is illustrated. The bag <b>43</b> includes a first, rear side <b>74</b> formed entirely of the mesh strip <b>34</b>, and a second front side <b>76</b> formed entirely of the film strip <b>36</b>. The sides <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> of the bag <b>43</b> are secured to one another to close the bag <b>43</b> by the vertical seams <b>41</b> and <b>57</b>, the top lateral seam <b>71</b>, and the bottom lateral seam <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-16</figref>, a second embodiment of the sheet <b>132</b> is illustrated. In this embodiment, a roll <b>130</b> of the sheet <b>132</b> capable of being used on the machine <b>42</b> similar to roll <b>30</b> is shown as being formed of a central mesh strip <b>134</b> and a pair of outer polymeric film strips <b>136</b> disposed on opposite sides of the central mesh strip <b>134</b>. The central mesh strip <b>134</b> and the outer film strips <b>136</b> are formed of the same or similar materials as the mesh strip <b>34</b> and film strip <b>36</b> of sheet <b>32</b>, and are thermally bonded to one another to form seams <b>141</b> along adjacent longitudinal edges <b>138</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively, in the same manner described previously with respect to the sheet <b>32</b>. Also, the percentages of the mesh strip <b>134</b> and the film strips <b>136</b> are within the ranges discussed with regard to the sheet <b>32</b>, with the overall percentage for the polymeric film material divided, preferably generally equally, between the film strips <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A bag <b>143</b> is formed from the web or sheet <b>132</b> by placing the roll <b>130</b> of the sheet <b>132</b> on the vertical form, fill and seal machine <b>42</b> and running the sheet <b>132</b> through the machine <b>42</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in converting the sheet <b>132</b> in the machine <b>42</b> to form the product-filled bags <b>143</b>, the end sealing and cutting device <b>70</b> is oriented 90&#xb0; with respect to the position of the device <b>70</b> on the machine <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> back to the conventional position for the device <b>70</b> on the machine <b>42</b>. The sealing and cutting device is oriented in this manner so that, when the sheet <b>132</b> is connected in the machine <b>42</b>, the vertical seam <b>157</b> is located on the front face of the bag <b>143</b> rather than at an edge. In this reoriented configuration for the device <b>70</b>, the resulting bag <b>143</b> formed by the sheet <b>132</b> including the central mesh strip <b>134</b> and the outer film strips <b>136</b> has a first, rear side <b>174</b> formed entirely of the mesh strip <b>134</b>, a second, front side <b>176</b> formed entirely of the joined outer film strips <b>136</b>. The edges are formed entirely of mesh and, therefore, can be gusseted without interference with seams and without threatening the integrity of the seams. Gussets <b>178</b> can be formed on the sides of the bag <b>143</b> using a pair of opposed folding mechanisms (not shown), as are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-22</figref>, still a third embodiment of the present invention is shown in which a sheet <b>232</b> is formed similarly to the sheet <b>132</b> including a central polymeric mesh strip <b>234</b> and a pair of outer polymeric film strips <b>236</b> having longitudinal edges <b>240</b> heat-bonded to opposed longitudinal edges <b>238</b> of the mesh strip <b>234</b> in the manner described previously. However, the sheet <b>232</b> also may include an optional strip <b>280</b> of a separate labeling material positioned on the mesh strip <b>234</b> between and on the same side of the mesh strip <b>234</b> as the film strips <b>236</b>. The labeling material strip <b>280</b> is bonded to the central mesh strip <b>234</b> in the same manner as the film strips <b>236</b> and is also formed of a material similar to, but not necessarily the same as, the film strips <b>236</b>. It could alternatively be applied to the remainder of the sheet <b>232</b> during the form, fill, and seal process.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sheet <b>232</b> can also be formed into a roll (not shown) and converted in the vertical form, fill and seal machine <b>42</b> in the same manner as the sheet <b>132</b> in order to form a product-filled bag <b>243</b> best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-22</figref>. The bag <b>243</b> is highly similar to the bag <b>143</b>. It includes a first, front face <b>276</b> formed by the vertical seam <b>257</b> joining the outer film strips <b>236</b> via the vertical sealing device <b>56</b> on the machine <b>42</b>, and a second, rear face <b>274</b> formed entirely of the mesh strip <b>234</b> and having a pair of gussets <b>278</b> joining the sides <b>274</b> and <b>276</b> and formed entirely from the mesh strip <b>234</b>. The bag <b>243</b> also includes a top lateral seam <b>271</b> and a bottom lateral seam <b>272</b> formed by the end sealing and cutting device <b>70</b> on the machine <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</figref>, based on the positioning of the labeling strip <b>280</b> in the center of the mesh strip <b>234</b>, the rear face <b>274</b> is formed such that the strip <b>280</b> overlays at least substantially the entire length and width of the rear face <b>274</b> between the top seam <b>271</b> and the bottom seam <b>272</b>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the sheet <b>232</b> enables the resulting bag <b>243</b> to be formed with gussets <b>278</b> in the polymeric mesh material <b>234</b> to enable the contents of the bag <b>243</b> to receive adequate ventilation, but also provides two separate printing surfaces on the rear face <b>274</b> and the front face <b>276</b> of the bag <b>243</b> for use as necessary. However, the size of the labeling strip <b>280</b> can also be varied in width and/or length to provide additional exposed mesh areas of the rear face <b>274</b> to increase the ventilation capable through the bag <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As indicated above, the relative widths and locations of the strips of sheets falling within the scope of the present invention may vary significantly from the examples described above. In addition, while webs or sheets have been described having either two or three strip substrates, it should be understood that the invention applies to webs having more than three strip substrates as well. It also applies to webs or sheets having more than two substrates, such as one having a low density film substrate, a polymeric mesh substrate, and a high density film substrate. To the extent that they might not be apparent from the above, the scope of additional variations falling within the scope of the present invention will become apparent from the appended claims.</p>
