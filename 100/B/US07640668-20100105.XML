<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to cutting heads for rotary trimmers and, more specifically, it relates to an improved cutting head for rotary trimmers using continuous lengths of spooled monofilament strings as a means for cutting vegetation. The present disclosure represents an improvement over presently existing cutting head designs and allows for quick, smooth, ratchet-type efficient loading of the monofilament strings onto the spool of a cutting head.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flail feedout means for mowing and trimming devices used to trim grass, weeds, and other vegetation, of the rotary type equipped with flexible cord-like flails formed of generally cylindrical fibers, are well known in the art. Grass and weed cutters of this general type are widely known and the subject of various patented devices including those described in Ballas et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,826,068; Mizuno et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,552; Prouix, U.S. Pat. No. 4,097,991; Perdue, U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,204; Toro, Belgium Patent No. 852,150; and Prouix, U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,782. Such devices are available on the market having automatic flail feedout mechanisms which respond to a bump on the ground intentionally applied by the operator or by the application of force applied thereto by some mechanical arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An improved flail feedout mechanism for a rotary mower is disclosed in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,782, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. However, the specific construction of the tangs and the serpentinous cam slot in that device is designed to result in stress concentrations in the engaging members and, as a result, an abrupt and discontinuous operation of the feedout assembly occurs which results in potential wear of the assembly parts, as well as non-smooth operation of the mowing device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Applicant is the inventor of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 B2 which issued on May 18, 2004 and is entitled &#x201c;Cutting Head for a Rotary Trimmer&#x201d;. U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 is incorporated in its entirety herein and basically discloses a handle with an attached drive means that is connected to a spinning housing. The housing has a spool containing one or more coils of string used as filaments for cutting vegetation. A pair of orifices is oppositely positioned on the spool for guiding the exposed filament to the proper cutting position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The feed-out assembly of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 is disclosed in detail in said patent and operates smoothly so that its performance does not degrade with use. Also, the assembly operates in a smooth and consistent manner, without resulting in stress concentrations on individual parts forming the feed-out assembly, as was the shortcoming in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the cutting head disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 operates in an efficient and smooth manner, a need exists for a cutting head that can be quickly and easily loaded with a length of flail. A further need exists for a cutting head for a rotary trimmer that can be loaded without requiring disassembly of the cutting head.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An improved cutting head which may be more quickly and easily loaded with predetermined lengths of flail without requiring disassembly of the cutting head is provided. In one embodiment, a control mechanism is provided in the cutting head interacting between a follower member and a spool member so as to provide for one way rotational loading of the flails into the cutting head; in other words, to load the flails, the spool member is rotated continuously 360&#xb0; in one direction only, e.g., clockwise. In another embodiment, a cutting head allows the flails to be loaded by a ratcheting-type operation, i.e., a back and forth rotational movement, which is less fatiguing and even more efficient in its loading operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A cutting head for a rotary trimmer configured to facilitate loading of at least one cutting line, e.g., flail, is provided. Generally, a rotary trimmer includes a hollow handle with an attached drive means that is connected to a spinning housing, e.g., a cutting head. The housing has a spool member containing one or more coils of string used as filaments for cutting vegetation. A pair of orifices is oppositely positioned on the spool member for guiding the exposed filament to the proper cutting position.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flail feed-out assembly of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 is employed in the cutting head for a rotary trimmer of the present disclosure. The flail feed-out assembly <b>300</b> basically comprises a follower member <b>302</b>, a cam member <b>304</b>, and a spool member <b>306</b>. The follower member <b>302</b> is of generally cylindrical configuration having four uniformly spaced, radially inwardly facing tangs <b>308</b> adjacent the upper surface <b>310</b> of the follower member <b>302</b>. Projecting radially outwardly of the follower member <b>302</b>, and uniformly spaced, are six knobs, each designated by the numeral <b>312</b>. The knobs are disposed intermediate the side wall of the follower member <b>302</b>, with each knob <b>312</b> being of cylindrical configuration and with the knobs being uniformly spaced in a radial direction at an angle of 60 degrees relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cam member <b>304</b> has a lower, annular plate <b>320</b> of a diameter slightly less than the inner diameter of the cylindrical follower member <b>302</b>. Annular plate <b>320</b> includes a central hole. Formed integral with the plate <b>320</b>, and formed adjacent the upper surface of the cam member <b>304</b>, is a serpentinous cam groove <b>324</b>. The latter has radially oriented lower surfaces <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and vertical abutment portions <b>330</b> disposed at about 90 degrees to the lower surfaces <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>. The upper surface <b>332</b> of the cam groove <b>324</b> is formed by a plurality of radially outwardly oriented tangs <b>334</b> so that the serpentinous path of the cam groove <b>324</b> jogs at right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the follower tangs <b>308</b> are restricted to motion within the cam groove <b>324</b>. The tangs <b>308</b> move from one adjacent vertical surface <b>330</b> to the next facing in the same direction. The tangs <b>334</b> include sidewardly facing planar abutment surfaces which assist in reducing the hammering pressures when the tangs <b>308</b> move from an abutment with one vertical surface <b>330</b> to the next.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The spool member <b>306</b> includes six grooves <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> in its inner cylindrical surface <b>356</b>. The grooves <b>350</b> are diametrically opposed and axially aligned within the spool member <b>306</b> down to a radially oriented abutment in cylindrical surface <b>356</b> and having lateral cut-outs <b>358</b> adjacent thereto. The grooves <b>350</b> receive two outwardly extending, diametrically opposed knobs which slide therealong and lock the follower member <b>302</b> to which the knobs <b>312</b> are mounted to rotate with the spool member <b>306</b>. The grooves <b>352</b> also extend from the top surface <b>354</b> of the spool member <b>306</b> down to the radially oriented abutment in cylindrical surface <b>356</b>, with the width of each groove <b>352</b> corresponding to the maximum width of the grooves <b>350</b>, including the lateral cut-outs <b>358</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, in the locked position of the follower member <b>302</b> in the spool member <b>306</b>, each of the six knobs <b>312</b> bears against a side wall of the respective grooves <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, thereby providing enhanced structural contact between the follower member <b>302</b> and the spool member <b>306</b> so as to improve the efficiency and smoothness of operation of the flail feed-out assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As noted above, although the cutting head of applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 operates in a smooth and efficient manner, it is desirable for the cutting head to be capable of rapidly loading the lengths of flail into the cutting head in an efficient and easy manner, and without disassembly of the cutting head.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An improved cutting head <b>100</b> for a rotary trimmer is provided. The cutting head of the present disclosure provides a control mechanism for loading a spool member of the cutting head quickly and efficiently without having to disassemble the cutting head. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a perspective top and bottom view of a cutting head in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated respectively. Generally, the cutting head <b>100</b> includes a generally cylindrical housing <b>11</b>. The housing <b>11</b> includes an upper housing <b>13</b> and a lower housing <b>15</b>. On the upper housing <b>13</b>, a coupling <b>17</b> is provided to couple the cutting head <b>100</b> to a drive means of a trimmer as is known in the art. The upper housing <b>13</b> further includes at least two diametrically opposed orifices <b>19</b>, e.g., eyelets, for enabling flail to extended from the spool member disposed in the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a control mechanism <b>21</b> is provided which extends beyond the lower housing <b>15</b>. As will be described in detail below, the control mechanism will serve two functions. The control mechanism <b>21</b> will cause the flail disposed in the housing <b>11</b> to extend through the eyelets <b>19</b> when the control mechanism <b>21</b> is bumped on a surface. This function is described in detail in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874. The control mechanism <b>21</b> will also be employed to load the flail into the cutting head <b>100</b>. In operation, a length of flail is inserted into eyelet <b>19</b> and the control mechanism <b>21</b> is rotated to cause the flail to be wrapped around the spool member disposed in the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exploded perspective view of a cutting head in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated. The cutting head <b>100</b> generally includes housing <b>11</b> including upper housing <b>13</b> and lower housing <b>15</b>. Coupler <b>17</b> is disposed in an aperture <b>23</b> of the upper housing <b>13</b>. The coupler <b>17</b> is illustrated as a square head bolt but may take other forms. It is to be appreciated that when assembled the coupler <b>17</b> will provide a driving force to the cutting head <b>100</b> from a drive means of the trimmer. Disposed on the drive bolt coupler <b>17</b> is a first washer <b>25</b>, biasing means <b>27</b>, e.g., a spring, a follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032;, the cam member <b>304</b>, a second washer <b>29</b> and a fastening means <b>31</b>, e.g., a threaded nut. The biasing means <b>27</b> will urge the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; into stable positions on the cam slot of the cam member <b>304</b> when undisturbed by force applied to the bumper or control mechanism <b>21</b>. The cutting head <b>100</b> further includes a spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; for supporting the flail. The assembled portion of the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; and the cam member <b>304</b> are disposed in the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; and the lower housing <b>15</b> is disposed about the lower portion of the spool member <b>35</b> and coupled to the upper housing <b>13</b> to complete the cutting head <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cutting head of the present disclosure has been designed to include a feed-out assembly which eliminates the six knobs <b>312</b> from the follower member <b>302</b>, as well as the grooves <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> from the spool member <b>306</b> as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874. In one embodiment, the cutting head of the present disclosure provides for a control mechanism interacting between the follower member and the spool member so as to provide for only one way rotational loading (e.g., clockwise) of the flails into the cutting head. It should also be noted that the cam member <b>304</b> of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 is of identical construction to the cam member forming a portion of the present disclosure. Furthermore, like numbers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> correspond to identical structure described and depicted in FIG. 4 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; includes a series of ramps<b>400</b> disposed along the peripheral inner surface of the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;. The spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; further includes at least one slot <b>37</b> for winding the flail about the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;. A plurality of flanges <b>38</b> are provided on an upper portion of the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; for retaining the flail within the slots <b>37</b>. A corresponding series of ribs <b>402</b> are provided on the lower circumferential surface of the cylindrical follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032;. The series of ramps <b>400</b> are substantially of the same size and shape, e.g., generally triangular, as the series of ribs <b>402</b> so when at rest the series of ribs <b>402</b> will mate with the series of ramps <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The interengagement of the ramps <b>400</b> of the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; and the ribs <b>402</b> of the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. By virtue of the interaction of said ramps and ribs, the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; may only be rotated in one direction, i.e., clockwise, since the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; is fixed within the cutting head by virtue of its attachment to the cam member <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of a cross-section of a cutting head <b>410</b> employing the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, eyelets <b>417</b>, <b>417</b> are disposed on diametrically opposite sides of the cutting head <b>410</b>, with each eyelet being aligned with one of the spaced slots <b>37</b> within the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;. To load the cutting head <b>410</b>, an end of a length of flail or string <b>414</b> is inserted in each eyelet <b>417</b> until it engages a retaining member <b>416</b>, after which the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;, i.e., the control mechanism extending from lower housing <b>15</b>, may be rotated in a clockwise direction until the spool member is fully loaded with the two lengths of string <b>414</b>, and sufficient string extends outside the cutting head for the vegetation cutting operation. When loading, the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; is rotated to wind the length of flail in at least one of the slots <b>37</b>. When rotating the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;, the series of ramps <b>400</b> will cause the series of ribs <b>402</b> of the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; to ride up in a vertical direction against the biasing force of the spring <b>27</b>. After a predetermined rotation is imparted to the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;, the ribs <b>402</b> will engage subsequent ramps <b>400</b>. Due to the structure of the ribs <b>402</b> and ramps <b>400</b>, the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; will only rotate in one direction and will not travel in an opposite direction possibly causing unspooling of the flail.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is noted that the tap-and-go feature of U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,874 is retained in the cutting head <b>410</b> by virtue of the interaction of the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; and the cam member <b>304</b>. Furthermore, the cutting head <b>410</b> does not require disassembly to restring the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, another embodiment of the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; is provided. In this embodiment, the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032; includes an upper spool portion <b>33</b> and a lower spool portion <b>35</b>. The lower spool portion <b>35</b> includes a channel that extends approximately 180 degrees around an inner peripheral surface of the spool member. When the upper spool portion <b>33</b> is coupled to the lower spool portion <b>35</b>, the channel <b>39</b> will retain the flail as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The channel <b>39</b> includes an insert orifice <b>41</b> for receiving the at least one flail and an exit orifice <b>43</b> for threading the at least one flail through the spool member. When loading the cutting head <b>100</b>, the lower spool portion <b>35</b> is rotated until the insert orifice <b>41</b> and exit orifice <b>43</b> align with the eyelets <b>417</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the upper housing <b>13</b>. A length of flail is then inserted into the insert orifice <b>41</b> via an eyelet <b>417</b> until it exits from the exit orifice <b>43</b> and eyelet <b>417</b> on the opposite side. The flail can then be pulled through the channel <b>39</b> until an equal length of flail extends from both sides of the cutting head. As the lower spool portion <b>35</b> is rotated, a ramp <b>45</b> located near each orifice <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> will cause each end of the flail to be wound around different slots <b>37</b> of the spool member <b>306</b>&#x2032;. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, as the lower spool portion <b>35</b> is rotated in the direction of arrow A, ramp <b>45</b> will cause a length of flail to ride up the ramp <b>45</b> as indicated by arrow B and to be wrap around the upper slot <b>37</b>. Similarly, a downward sloping ramp is disposed near the insert orifice <b>41</b> to cause the length of flail extending therefrom to be wrapped around the lower slot <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 11</figref>, another embodiment of the cutting head in accordance with the present disclosure is provided. Only the components different than the above-described embodiments will be described below. The components of this embodiment enable the cutting head to operate in an efficient and smooth manner and include the further improvement in the cutting head which allows the flails to be loaded by a ratcheting-type operation, that is, a back and forth rotational operation, which is less fatiguing to the individual loading the cutting head and is more efficient in the loading operation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spool member <b>500</b> of this embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C. Spool member <b>500</b> includes a cylindrical wall <b>504</b> as well as an end closure wall <b>506</b> which is integrally formed with a plurality of ramps <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>, on the opposite or external portion of the end closure wall <b>506</b> of the spool member <b>500</b> are a series of triangular-shaped ribs <b>508</b>. The latter are uniformly spaced about the periphery of the annular end closure wall <b>506</b>, so as to be radially disposed at an acute angle as, for example, between 15 degrees and 60 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the above-described embodiments, the end closure wall of the spool member would be exposed from the lower end of the cutting head and would be the surface which would be contacted by the cutting head during a tap-and-go operation and rotated for loading a predetermined length of flail. In this embodiment, the lower portion of the cylindrical wall <b>504</b> of the spool member <b>500</b> is disposed within an end cap <b>520</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The end cap <b>520</b> is of cylindrical configuration, with an end closure wall <b>522</b>, and internally of the end cap <b>520</b> are a series of ramps <b>524</b>. The ramps <b>524</b> correspond in number, spacing and shape to the triangular-shaped ribs <b>508</b> of the spool member <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The control mechanism is this embodiment is effectuated by the interaction of the spool member <b>500</b>, end cap <b>520</b>, the follower member <b>302</b>&#x2032; and cam member <b>304</b>. The triangular-shaped ribs <b>508</b> cooperate with the ramps <b>524</b> of the end cap <b>520</b> to provide the ratchet-type, or back and forth rotational, movement of the end cap <b>520</b> relative to the spool member <b>500</b> during a loading operation of the flails within the cutting head. The disposition of the ribs <b>508</b> and the triangular-shaped ramps <b>524</b> enable the ratchet-type loading of the flails, and this is accomplished in clockwise rotary direction of movement of the spool member <b>500</b>. The interaction between the ramps <b>502</b> of the spool member <b>500</b> and the follower member of the subject cutting head limits rotation of the spool member to a single direction, such as clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a perspective, cross-sectional view of a new and improved cutting head <b>510</b> of the present disclosure including the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-10</figref>. As will be noted, the spool member <b>500</b> is received within the end cap <b>520</b>. In turn, the end cap <b>520</b> is rotatably mounted within the housing <b>11</b>, with the spring (not shown) of the cutting head providing intimate contact between the various components of the subject cutting head. As end cap <b>520</b> is ratcheted back and forth, the spool member <b>500</b> rotates in one direction to load the flail.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The new and improved cutting head of the present embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-11</figref> provides a new and improved cutting head which operates in an efficient and smooth manner and which allows the flails to be loaded by a ratcheting-type operation, which is less fatiguing to the user and more efficient in its loading operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Many changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications of the present disclosure will, however, become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the foregoing specification together with the accompanying drawings. All such changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure are deemed to be covered by the present disclosure.</p>
