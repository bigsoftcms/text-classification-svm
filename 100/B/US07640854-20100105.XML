<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The described embodiments relate generally to engineered wood products and, more specifically, to a timing assembly for a press unit of a manufactured wood products press.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Orientated strand board (&#x201c;OSB&#x201d;), parallel strand board lumber and other engineered wood products are formed by layering strands (flakes) of wood in specific orientations. Such manufactured wood products are typically manufactured in wide mats from cross-orientated layers of thin, rectangular wooden strips compressed and bonded together with wax and resin adhesives (95% wood, 5% wax and resin). These strips are created by refining wood into strips, which are sifted and then orientated on a belt.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The mat is made in forming a bed, the layers are built up with external layers aligned in the panel direction and internal layers randomly positioned. The number of layers placed is set by the required thickness of the finished panel. The mat is then placed in a thermal press system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently developed press systems utilize a plurality of press units, each having opposed platens. The opposed platens are driven, in part, by an eccentric shaft and motion of the multiple platens is coordinated to permit the press system to operate as designed. Specifically, it is desirable that rotation of all of the eccentric shafts be synchronized such that all eccentric shafts rotate at substantially the same angular velocity and are in positional phase.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there exists a need for a timing assembly for a press unit of a manufactured wood product press.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A timing assembly for a manufactured wood products press is provided. Such a manufactured wood products press includes a first drive shaft coupled to a first platen and a second drive shaft coupled to a second platen. The first and second platens are disposed within the manufactured wood products press in an opposed manner. The timing assembly includes a housing and a plurality of timing gears disposed within the housing. The plurality of timing gears are connected to the first and second drive shafts for simultaneously driving the first and second drive shafts in an eccentric path.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A combination timing assembly and link assembly for a manufactured wood products press is also provided. The manufactured wood product press includes a first drive shaft coupled to a first platen and a second drive shaft coupled to a second platen. The first and second platens are disposed within the manufactured wood products press in an opposed manner. The combination timing assembly and linking assembly includes a main gear assembly and a linking gear assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The main gear assembly includes a housing, a plurality of timing gears disposed within the housing, and a first drive mechanism. The first drive mechanism extends between the plurality of timing gears and one of either the first or second drive shafts to transmit motion between the main gear assembly and the first or second platen to drive the first or second platen in a non-linear motion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The linking gear assembly includes a housing, a plurality of linking gears disposed within the housing, and a linking drive shaft. The linking drive shaft extends between one of the plurality of timing gears and one of the plurality of linking gears.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of a combination timing assembly and linking assembly for a manufactured wood products press is also provided. The manufactured wood product press includes a first pair of opposed platens and a second pair of opposed platens. The first pair of opposed platens includes a first plurality of drive shafts and the second pair of opposed platens includes a second plurality of drive shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The combination timing assembly and linking assembly includes a first main gear assembly having a plurality of gears operatively connected to the first plurality of drive shafts. The combination timing assembly and linking assembly further includes a second main gear assembly having a plurality of gears operatively connected to the second plurality of drive shafts, and a linking gear assembly. The linking gear assembly is coupled to the first and second main gear assemblies to simultaneously drive, at least in part, the first and second pairs of opposed platens in a non-linear motion.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> is shown as it would be used with a manufactured wood products press <b>60</b>. Note that the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> is suitably a well-known press used in producing manufactured wood products, such as OSB. One such press is described in a co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/236,925, entitled MANUFACTURED WOOD PRODUCT PRESS, assigned to Weyerhaeuser Company of Federal Way, Wash., the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> includes a press unit <b>20</b>, a frame <b>62</b>, and drive motors <b>64</b>. The manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> suitably includes two press units <b>20</b> disposed within the frame <b>62</b> in an opposed manner. In the illustrated embodiment, there are a plurality of press units <b>20</b> disposed within the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b>, such that a plurality of opposed press units <b>20</b> are positioned along a length of the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b>. The plurality of press units <b>20</b> are coupled to and driven at least in part by the plurality of combination timing assembly and linking assemblies <b>66</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As positioned within the frame <b>62</b>, each press unit <b>20</b> counteracts the other during operation of the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> to produce a wide variety of manufactured wood products. The production of such manufactured wood products is well-known in the art and is not detailed for conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Individual press units <b>20</b> are actuated by rotating crank shafts <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> that are driven by the drive motors <b>64</b>. The press units <b>20</b> are operated in a precisely coordinated manner, e.g., such that the drive shafts are rotationally in phase and are partially controlled by the gear box <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although two press units <b>20</b> are illustrated, it should be apparent that the appended claims are not intended to be so limited. As a non-limiting example, the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> may include only one press unit <b>20</b> positioned to be actuated against a fixed, opposing surface. Thus, manufactured wood products presses <b>60</b> having more or less press units <b>20</b> are also within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The press unit <b>20</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>. The press unit <b>20</b> suitably includes first and second drive assemblies <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>. Although the press unit <b>20</b> is illustrated as including two drive assemblies <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, it should be apparent that other press units having more or less drive assemblies are also within the scope of the present invention. As an example, a press unit with only one drive assembly or one having three or more drive assemblies is within the scope of the present invention. Also, because each drive assembly is identically configured, only one drive assembly will be described in greater detail. However, the description of one drive assembly is equally applicable to all drive assemblies of similar construction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The drive assembly <b>76</b> includes a housing <b>80</b>, a drive mechanism <b>82</b>, a conversion plate <b>84</b>, and an insulation layer <b>86</b>. The drive assembly <b>76</b> also includes a key plate <b>88</b> and a platen <b>90</b>. The housing <b>80</b> is suitably configured to house the drive mechanism <b>82</b> in a bath of lubricant, such as oil (not shown). Although the press unit <b>20</b> is illustrated as having two separate housing, other embodiments, such as a press unit having a single housing, are also within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As may be best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conversion plate <b>84</b> is suitably attached to a portion of the drive mechanism <b>82</b>. A lower surface of the conversion plate <b>84</b> includes a downwardly extending oil shield <b>92</b>. The oil shield <b>92</b> is sized to be sealingly engaged with an upper end <b>94</b> of the housing <b>20</b>. During operation of the press unit, the oil shield <b>92</b> reciprocates or slides within the upper end <b>94</b> of the housing <b>80</b>. As configured, the oil shield seals the bath of lubricants disposed within the housing <b>80</b> and permits the drive mechanism <b>82</b> to be driven by the drive motors <b>64</b> in a manner described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the insulation layer <b>86</b> is sandwiched between an upper surface of the conversion plate <b>84</b> and a lower surface of the key plate <b>88</b>. The sandwiched assembly is attached to the drive assembly <b>76</b> by well-known fasteners, such as bolts. The well-known platen <b>90</b> is fastened, at least in part, to the key plate <b>88</b> by a pair of attachment keys <b>96</b><i>a </i>and <b>96</b><i>b </i>lockingly engaging a corresponding notch (not shown) located in a lower surface of the platen <b>90</b>. To further secure the platen <b>92</b> to the drive assembly <b>76</b>, well-known anchors <b>98</b><i>a</i>-<b>98</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) secure perimeter end portions of the platen <b>90</b> to the drive assembly <b>76</b>, where it is driven by the drive mechanism <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The drive mechanism <b>82</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. The drive mechanism <b>82</b> includes a shaft <b>120</b>, a plurality of support bearing members <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>f</i>, and a plurality of platen drive bearing members <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>e</i>. Although a prescribed number of support bearing members <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>f </i>and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>e </i>are illustrated, it should be apparent that a drive mechanism <b>82</b> having any number combination of support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> is also within the scope of the present invention. Thus, a drive mechanism <b>82</b> having more or fewer support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> is also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As may be best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the shaft <b>120</b> is suitably formed from any well-known, high strength material, such as steel, and includes a plurality of concentric portions <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>f </i>and a plurality of eccentric portions <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<b>128</b><i>e</i>. The concentric and eccentric portions are suitably integrally formed with the shaft <b>120</b> during manufacture of the shaft <b>120</b>. The concentric and eccentric portions are disposed along a longitudinal axis <b>130</b> extending through the length of the shaft <b>120</b> and are disposed on the shaft <b>120</b> in an alternating fashion. As an example, the concentric and eccentric portions are disposed in an alternating fashion between the ends of the shaft <b>120</b>, such that an eccentric portion is disposed between two concentric portions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">All of the concentric portions <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>f </i>share a common axis of rotation during operation. Similarly, all eccentric portions <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<b>128</b><i>e </i>share a second common axis of rotation, different from the axis of rotation of the concentric portions <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>f</i>. This aspect is described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The axis of rotation of the eccentric portions <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<b>128</b><i>e </i>is offset from the axis of rotation of the concentric portions <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>f</i>. As best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the eccentric portions <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<b>128</b><i>e </i>have a circular cross-section and are offset from the circular cross-section of the concentric portions by an equal amount. Specifically, the eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>c </i>is positioned adjacent the concentric portion <b>126</b><i>d </i>and the axis of rotation of the eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>c </i>is off-set from the axis of rotation of the concentric portion <b>126</b><i>d </i>by an amount illustrated by the arrow <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similarly, the eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>d </i>has an axis of rotation offset from the adjacent concentric portion <b>126</b><i>e </i>by an amount illustrated by the arrow <b>134</b>. Finally, the axis of rotation of the eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>d </i>is offset from the axis of rotation of the adjacent concentric portion <b>126</b><i>f </i>by an amount illustrated by the arrow <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The alternating eccentric and concentric portions have an increasing diameter as viewed from the ends towards the middle of the shaft <b>120</b>. This configuration accommodates support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> of the same internal diameter to minimize cost and expense. It should be apparent that although a shaft <b>120</b> having such a configuration is preferred, other embodiments are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As a non-limiting example, a shaft <b>120</b> having all eccentric portions of constant diameter and all concentric portions of a second diameter but different from the diameter of the eccentric portions is also within the scope of the present invention. In this non-limiting example, the use of well known split bearings sized to fit one of the eccentric or concentric portions may be utilized as support bearing members and platen drive bearing members. Thus, shafts <b>120</b> of different constructions are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As may be best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> are mounted to the concentric portions <b>126</b> and eccentric portions <b>128</b>, respectively, on bushings. In the partial view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support bearing members <b>122</b><i>d</i>-<b>122</b><i>f </i>and the platen drive bearing members <b>124</b><i>c</i>-<b>124</b><i>e </i>are well-known pillow blocks. Each one of the support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> are identically configured and include an attachment opening of constant diameter represented by the arrow <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">During assembly, support bearing members <b>122</b> are mounted on the concentric portion <b>126</b> and the corresponding land for each one of the bearing members <b>122</b> is positioned to be anchored to the housing <b>80</b>. The housing <b>80</b> may, in turn, be anchored to a support footing (not shown) to absorb loads associated with operation of the press unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> are rotated 180&#xb0; from the support bearing members <b>122</b> such that the land of each of the platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> is positioned to be coupled to the platen <b>90</b> in a manner described above. The support bearing members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b> are seated on corresponding eccentric or concentric portion on bushing <b>140</b>. For ease of manufacture, the thickness of each cylindrical portion of each bushing <b>140</b> is dimensioned to accommodate the sizing requirements of the shaft <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, and as an example, the bushing <b>140</b> is sized to be received within the attachment opening of the platen drive bearing member <b>124</b><i>c</i>. The attachment opening has a diameter (indicated by the arrow <b>142</b>) large enough to be slidably received on the shaft <b>120</b>, such that it fits snugly on the outside diameter of the eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>c</i>. The attachment opening is large enough to pass freely over all of the other concentric and eccentric portions during its path of travel along the shaft <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Similarly, the bushing <b>145</b> is sized to be received within the support bearing member <b>122</b><i>d</i>. The bushing <b>145</b> has an opening <b>144</b> sized to be received on the outside diameter of the concentric portion <b>126</b><i>d </i>but is smaller than the outside diameter of eccentric portion <b>128</b><i>c</i>. However, the inside diameter of the opening <b>144</b> slides freely over all other eccentric and concentric portions of the shaft <b>120</b>. As noted above, this design permits the use of identical support bearings members <b>122</b> and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As assembled, each of the support bearing members <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>f </i>and platen drive bearing members <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>e </i>are secured to the shaft <b>120</b> by well-known end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b</i>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, each end cap <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>is sized and configured to act as a counterbalance to the platen <b>90</b> during operation of the press unit <b>20</b>. The end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>are suitably formed from a solid piece of high strength material, such as aluminum. The interior is machined to create a substantially C-shaped channel <b>147</b> extending substantially the entire length of the end cap. By the inclusion of the channel <b>147</b> in the end caps, the end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>act as a counterbalance to the platen <b>90</b> during operation. Specifically, the end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>are mounted to respective ends of the shaft <b>120</b>, such that the closed end of the channel <b>147</b> is located nearest the platen <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ends of the end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>also include an optional mass adjustment assembly <b>149</b>. The mass adjustment assembly <b>149</b> is a pair of opposed prongs. The prongs are sized and configured to receive corresponding mass plates (not shown) to permit selective addition of mass to the end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>to selectively adjust the counterbalancing characteristics of the end caps <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each of the end caps are keyed to the shaft <b>120</b> by a protrusion (not shown) formed within an internal cavity of the end cap. The protrusion of the end caps is sized to be received within a corresponding notch <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b </i>formed in respective ends of the shaft <b>120</b>. The assembled drive mechanism <b>82</b> is then disposed within the housing <b>80</b> and connected to the drive motors <b>64</b> in a manner well-known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Operation of the press unit <b>20</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>. It should be apparent that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> are sequential cross-sectional end planar views of a portion of the drive mechanism <b>82</b> during operation to illustrate sequential movements of the press unit <b>20</b>. For ease of illustration and clarity in understanding movement of various components of the press unit <b>20</b>, certain dimensions have been exaggerated and, therefore, illustrated spacing is not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the concentric portions <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>f </i>rotate about a constant axis of rotation, referred to as a concentric axis of rotation <b>150</b>. As also described above, the eccentric portions <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<b>128</b><i>e </i>rotate about a second axis of rotation, known as an eccentric axis of rotation <b>152</b>. However, as the drive motors <b>64</b> rotate the shaft <b>120</b>, and due to the offset <b>134</b>, the eccentric axis of rotation <b>152</b> rotates around the concentric axis of rotation <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As driven, the drive assembly <b>76</b> moves in a non-linear motion. To better illustrate this motion, and still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, assume that the drive motors <b>64</b> turn the shafts <b>120</b> in a clockwise direction about the concentric axis of rotation <b>150</b> and as indicated by the arrow <b>156</b>. As driven, the concentric portion <b>126</b> rotates about the concentric axis of rotation <b>150</b>, such that it remains a fixed distance from the base of the housing <b>80</b> and indicated by the arrow <b>154</b> throughout the operation cycle of the press unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At the same time, however, due to the offset distance <b>134</b>, the eccentric axis of rotation <b>152</b> of the eccentric portions <b>128</b> rotates about the concentric axis of rotation <b>150</b> to drive the platen <b>90</b> from a fully extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) to a mid-position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), and finally to a fully retracted or down position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>). As the drive motors <b>64</b> continue to drive the press unit <b>20</b>, the platen <b>90</b> is returned to the fully extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). Thus, the drive motors <b>64</b> drive the drive assembly <b>76</b> between a fully extended position, to a fully retracted position, and returns back to the fully extended position. This type of motion drives the platen <b>90</b> in a substantially non-linear motion, such as circular.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A press unit <b>20</b> constructed in accordance with the various embodiments of the present invention provides a compact and highly reliable alternative to existing press units.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. The combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> includes a main gear assembly <b>200</b> and a linking gear assembly <b>300</b>. Although the combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> is illustrated as including both the main gear assembly <b>200</b> and linking gear assembly <b>300</b>, it should be apparent that the main gear assembly <b>200</b> and linking gear assembly <b>300</b> may be used with the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> alone and not necessarily in combination. Thus, a manufactured wood products press having a main gear assembly <b>200</b>, a linking gear assembly <b>300</b>, or a combination of both are all within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The main gear assembly <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>202</b>, a plurality of timing gears <b>204</b>, and a plurality of drive mechanisms <b>206</b>. The plurality of timing gears <b>204</b> are rotatably disposed within the housing <b>202</b> and include a plurality of carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<b>208</b><i>d</i>. The plurality of timing gears <b>204</b> also includes first and second drive gears <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The plurality of carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<b>208</b><i>d </i>and first and second drive gears <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are located within the housing <b>202</b> such that the first and second drive gears <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are positioned between the plurality of carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<b>208</b><i>d </i>for synchronized movement.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifically, and as may be best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>are positioned in the corners of the housing <b>202</b>, with the first and second drive gears <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>located near the center of the housing <b>202</b>. In this embodiment, the first and second carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>b </i>engage the first drive gear <b>210</b><i>a</i>. The first and second drive gears <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are engaged, while the third and fourth carrier gears <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>engage the second drive gear <b>210</b><i>b</i>. As configured, rotation of one of the gears causes a corresponding rotation of the other gears.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As an example, if the first carrier gear <b>208</b><i>a </i>is driven in clockwise direction <b>212</b>, because of its engagement with the first drive gear <b>210</b><i>a</i>, the first drive gear <b>210</b><i>a </i>is rotated in a counterclockwise direction <b>214</b>. Because of its engagement with both the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b </i>and the second drive gear <b>210</b><i>b</i>, rotation of the first drive gear <b>210</b><i>a </i>causes the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b </i>to rotate in a clockwise direction <b>216</b> and, simultaneously causes the second drive gear <b>210</b><i>b </i>in a clockwise direction <b>218</b>. As rotated, and because the third and fourth carrier gears <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b> engage the second drive gear <b>210</b><i>b</i>, the third and fourth carrier gears <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>are rotated in counterclockwise directions <b>220</b> and <b>222</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is this simultaneous and synchronized movement of the plurality of timing gears <b>204</b> that cause the opposed platens <b>90</b> of the press units <b>20</b> to operate in unity, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The plurality of drive mechanisms <b>206</b> may be best understood by referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. The plurality of drive mechanisms <b>206</b> includes a plurality of drive shafts <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<b>224</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, one end of the drive shafts <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<b>224</b><i>b </i>are operatively coupled, in a manner well-known in the art, to carrier gears <b>208</b><i>a</i>-<b>208</b><i>d</i>. The other end of the drive shafts <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<b>224</b><i>d </i>are similarly coupled to the drive shafts <b>120</b> of the press units <b>20</b> to simultaneously drive the drive shafts <b>120</b> in the eccentric path described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the manufactured wood products press <b>66</b> includes more than one pair of press units <b>20</b>, it is desirable to include multiple timing assemblies <b>200</b>. Coordinated and synchronized motion of the press units <b>20</b> is accomplished at least in part by synchronizing the timing assemblies <b>200</b> to each other by the linking gear assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The linking gear assembly <b>300</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The linking gear assembly <b>300</b> includes a housing <b>302</b> and a plurality of linking gears <b>304</b>. The plurality of linking gears <b>304</b> includes a linking drive gear <b>306</b> and first and second linking carrier gears <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, the linking drive gear <b>306</b> is disposed between the first and second linking carrier gears <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b</i>, such that rotation of one of the plurality of linking gears <b>304</b> causes rotation of the other linking gears.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As an example, rotation of the first linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>a </i>in a clockwise direction <b>310</b> causes the linking drive gear <b>306</b> to rotate in a counterclockwise direction <b>312</b>. Because the second linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b </i>is meshed to the linking drive gear <b>306</b>, rotation of the linking drive gear <b>306</b> in the counterclockwise direction <b>312</b> causes the second linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b </i>to rotate in a clockwise direction <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As may be best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the linking gear assembly <b>300</b> includes a linking drive shaft <b>316</b>. The linking drive shaft <b>316</b> extends between one of the plurality of linking gears <b>304</b> and one of the plurality of timing gears <b>204</b>. As an example, the linking drive shaft <b>316</b> extends between and couples the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b </i>and the second linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b</i>. As configured, the linking drive shaft <b>316</b> synchronizes rotation of the second linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b </i>with the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be apparent that although the linking drive shaft <b>316</b> is illustrated and described as linking the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b </i>and the second linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b</i>, the scope of this disclosure is not intended to be so limited. As an example and as best seen by referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>, the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> includes a plurality of press units <b>20</b>. In order to simultaneously link operation of all of the plurality of press units <b>20</b>, the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> includes a plurality of timing assemblies <b>200</b> and linking assemblies <b>300</b>. Each one of the timing assemblies <b>200</b> and linking assemblies <b>300</b> are identically configured as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Where a plurality of timing assemblies <b>200</b> are use to coordinate and operate a plurality of press units <b>20</b>, the plurality of timing assemblies <b>200</b> are coupled to each other by the linking assemblies <b>300</b>. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, rotation of the second lining carrier gear <b>308</b><i>b </i>is tied to the rotation of the second carrier gear <b>208</b><i>b </i>by the linking drive shaft <b>316</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> due to illustration limitations, the first linking carrier gear <b>308</b><i>a </i>is similarly coupled to a first carrier gear (not shown) of a second main gear assembly <b>400</b> by another linking drive shaft (not shown). Because the first and second linking carrier gears <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>are synchronized by the linking drive gear <b>306</b>, both the rate of rotation and direction of rotation of the first and second linking carrier gears <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>are the same.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, it should be apparent that as many or as few timing and linking assemblies <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> may be coupled to the manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> as necessary to link operation of all of the press units <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Operation of the timing and linking assemblies <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. As noted above, a manufactured wood products press <b>60</b> having a plurality of press units <b>20</b> requires that all of the press units <b>20</b> operate simultaneously. Specifically, such a press <b>60</b> requires that all of the shafts <b>120</b> of each press unit <b>20</b> be synchronized, such that all shafts <b>120</b> begin in the same position and rotate at the same velocity. As a result, the timing of the motion of the platens <b>90</b> must be synchronized, such that motion of all the platens <b>90</b> is coordinated to provide the desired movement, such as compression. This synchronization is accomplished by the timing and linking assemblies <b>200</b> and <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> is coupled to the shaft <b>120</b> of each press unit <b>20</b>. In this view, there are two press units <b>20</b> disposed in an opposed relationship within the frame <b>62</b>. As previously described, each press unit <b>20</b> includes a shaft <b>120</b> adapted to drive a platen <b>90</b> in a substantially non-linear or circular motion. The drive shafts <b>224</b><i>a </i>and <b>224</b><i>b </i>of the combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> are coupled to the shafts <b>120</b> of the press units <b>20</b> by a coupling drive shaft <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b</i>. Although the use of a coupling drive shaft <b>340</b> is preferred, other embodiments, such as directly coupling the shaft <b>120</b> to the drive shaft <b>224</b>, are also within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As coupled to the combination timing assembly and linking assembly <b>66</b> and because the plurality of timing gears <b>204</b> and the plurality of linking gears <b>304</b> are meshed, operation of the press units <b>20</b> are all simultaneous and synchronized with each other. Such an assembly provides an inexpensive solution to timing operation of a manufactured wood products press <b>66</b> having at least two opposed platens.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
