<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a punch press with forming dies supported on a die supporting member such as a turret, to elevate and lower any of the forming dies for punching, and the present invention also relates to an operation method for a punch press with forming dies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram showing the general configuration of a turret type punch press. The turret type punch press has an upper turret <b>1</b> that circumferentially supports a plurality of punch tools and a lower turret <b>2</b> that circumferentially supports a plurality of die tools <b>5</b>. The upper turret <b>1</b> and the lower turret <b>2</b> are rotated to locate a desired set of the punch tool <b>4</b> and die tool <b>5</b> at a predetermined punch position P to punch a workpiece W that is a plate material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Punching includes piercing and forming. Piercing involves fixing the die tool <b>5</b> so that its top surface is flush with a top surface of a workpiece table <b>18</b>, and under this condition, lowering the punch tool <b>4</b> for piercing. Carrying out forming in a similar manner forms a formed part of the workpiece W below the top surface of the workpiece table <b>18</b>. In this case, the formed part may interfere with the workpiece table <b>18</b> to hinder workpiece feeding. Thus, for forming, for example, upward forming, an upward protruding die tool for forming (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;forming die&#x201d;) <b>5</b> is used to form the workpiece W so that its formed part is formed above the top surface of the workpiece table <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of such forming include a method of fixing the forming die <b>5</b> at a given position where the top surface of the forming die <b>5</b> is above the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b> and lowering the punch tool <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and a method of fixing the punch tool <b>4</b> at a given position where a bottom surface of the punch tool <b>4</b> is at the same height as that of the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b> and elevating the forming die <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> show conditions before forming, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> show conditions during forming. Where the punch tool <b>4</b> is lowered for forming as shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the forming dies <b>5</b> located away from the punch position P are retracted to a lowering position below the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b> in order to prevent hindrance to feeding of the workpiece W and damage to the back surface of the workpiece W. Thus, with either method for forming, the forming die <b>5</b> located at the punch position P needs to be elevated and lowered. The punch press is accordingly provided with an appropriate elevating and lowering device (for example, Japanese Patent No. 2889951).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The elevating and lowering device is composed of an advancing and retreating member formed as an inclined surface portion having a top surface inclined in one direction, and an actuator that advances and retreats the advancing and retreating member in the direction in which the inclined surface portion is inclined. With the inclined surface portion abutting against a part of the forming die located at the punch position, the advancing and retreating member is advanced or retreated to elevate or lower the forming die. According to Japanese Patent No. 2889951, the inclined surface portion of the advancing and retreating member is inclined in a direction orthogonal to a virtual straight line joining the punch position to the rotating center of the turret, that is, in a tangential direction of a circular trajectory along which the die tool is moved, and the advancing and retreating member also advances and retreats in this direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the punch press according to Japanese Patent No. 2889951, the elevating and lowering device for the forming dies is fixed at the punch position. Further, the advancing and retreating member advances and retreats in the tangential direction to elevate and lower the forming dies. Accordingly, even while the forming dies are lowering, the advancing and retreating member is located immediately below the circular trajectory or its vicinity. Thus, where a plurality of forming dies are provided in the lower turret in proximity to one another, when one of the forming dies is located at the punch position, the advancing and retreating member may interfere with forming dies located close to the punch position. Increasing the advancing and retreating strokes of the advancing and retreating member can avoid this interference. However, this disadvantageously increases the size of the elevating and lowering device, and the time required for the forming dies to elevate and lower. As a result, where a plurality of forming dies are provided in the lower turret, they are forced to be spaced at intervals. This limits the number and positions of forming dies attached. Further, since the advancing and lowering member is always located below the turret, slag falling from the turret adheres to the advancing and retreating member, and its advancement and retreat guiding section. This may hinder the operation of the elevating and lowering device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the advancing and retreating member advances and retreats in the tangential direction as is the case with the conventional punch press, one elevating and lowering device can elevate and lower only the forming dies on one circumference. Thus, where the forming dies are provided on a plurality of concentric circles, as many elevating and lowering devices as the concentric circles must be provided. This complicates the structure of peripheral portion of the punch position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a punch press with forming dies which reduces the limitation on the number and positions of forming dies attached to the die supporting member and which enables a device that elevates and lowers the forming dies to operate appropriately without being affected by slag. Another object of the present invention is to reduce the moving distance of the device that elevates and lowers the forming dies and to facilitate the movement. Further another object of the present invention is to, where the forming dies are provided on each of plural concentric circles, enable a single device to elevate and lower the forming dies on each concentric circle. Further another object of the present invention is to facilitate the position switching of an elevating and lowering member, while supporting a die supporting member so that the die supporting member is movable in a horizontal direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A punch press with forming dies according to the present invention comprises a die supporting member that supports a plurality of forming dies so that the forming dies can be elevated and lowered, a die elevating and lowering driving device that elevates and lowers the forming dies, and a die supporting member moving device that moves the die supporting member so as to locate one of the forming dies at a punch position. The die elevating and lowering driving device comprises an elevating and lowering device including an elevating and lowering member that elevates and lowers the forming die located at the punch position and an elevating and lowering driving member that drivingly elevates and lowers the elevating and lowering member, and further comprises position switching means for switching the elevating and lowering device between a position below the die supporting member and a retracting position outside the die supporting member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this configuration, the die supporting member moving device moves the die supporting member to locate one of the forming dies supported on the die supporting member, at the punch position. The forming die located at the punch position is elevated and lowered by the die elevating and lowering driving device. With the elevating and lowering device moved to below the die supporting member by the position switching member, the die elevating and lowering driving device operates to cause the elevating and lowering driving member of the elevating and lowering device to drivingly elevate and lower the elevating and lowering member to raise and lower the forming die. When no forming dies need to be elevated or lowered, the position switching means retreats the elevating and lowering device to the retracting position outside the die supporting member. Since the elevating and lowering device is located at the retracting position outside the die supporting member when no forming dies need to be elevated or lowered, the elevating and lowering device is prevented from interfering with forming dies located close to the forming die fixed at the punch position. This avoids limiting the number and positions of forming dies attached to the die supporting member, and a plurality of forming dies can be freely arranged on the die supporting member depending on operation type or procedure. Further, the elevating and lowering device is retracted to outside the die supporting member except when any forming die is elevated for punching. This prevents slag from adhering to the elevating and lowering device, which can thus always operate appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, the die supporting member is a circular or fan-shaped turret that moves rotatably to bring the forming die to the punch position. In this case, the position switching means preferably moves the elevating and lowering device in a direction of a virtual straight line joining the punch position to a rotating center of the turret. When the position of the elevating and lowering device is switched by moving the elevating and lowering device in the direction of the virtual line joining the punch position to the rotating center of the turret, the moving distance of the elevating and lowering device can be minimized to reduce the size of the die elevating and lowering driving device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The turret has the forming dies provided on a plurality of concentric circles around the rotating center of the turret. Since the elevating and lowering device moves in the direction of the virtual line joining the punch position to the rotating center of the turret, even if forming dies are provided on each of plural concentric circles, the forming dies on each concentric circle can be elevated and lowered by one elevating and lowering device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The die supporting member is supported by a bolster from below and be movable in a horizontal direction. In this case, an opening is formed in the bolster so that the elevating and lowering device can enter the opening. When the die supporting member is supported by the bolster from below, the die supporting member is prevented from being distorted during machining. When the opening is formed in the bolster so that the elevating and lowering device can enter the opening, the position of the elevating and lowering device can be switched through the opening. This facilitates the position switching of the elevating and lowering device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The punch press with forming dies according to the present invention comprises the die supporting member that supports the plurality of forming dies so that the forming dies can be elevated and lowered, the die elevating and lowering driving device that elevates and lowers the forming dies, and a die supporting member moving device that moves the die supporting member so as to locate one of the forming dies at a punch position. The die elevating and lowering driving device comprises the elevating and lowering member that elevates and lowers the forming die located at the punch position, and the elevating and lowering device composed the elevating and lowering driving member that drivingly elevates and lowers the elevating and lowering member, and further comprises the position switching means for switching the elevating and lowering device between the position below the die supporting member and the retracting position outside the die supporting member. This reduces the limitation on the number and positions of forming dies attached to the die supporting member. The device that elevates and lowers the forming dies can operate appropriately without being affected by slag.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Where the die supporting member is a circular or fan-shaped turret that moves rotatably to bring the forming die to the punch position, and the position switching means preferably moves the elevating and lowering device in the direction of the virtual straight line joining the position below the die supporting member to the rotating center of the turret, the moving distance of the elevating and lowering device can be minimized to reduce the size of the die elevating and lowering driving device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Where the turret has the forming dies provided on the plurality of concentric circles around the rotating center of the turret, the forming dies on each concentric circle can be elevated and lowered by one elevating and lowering device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Where the die supporting means is supported by the bolster from below and be movable in the horizontal direction, and the opening is formed in the bolster so that the elevating and lowering device can enter the opening, the die supporting member is prevented from being distorted during machining. This also facilitates the position switching of the elevating and lowering device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. This embodiment is obtained by applying the present invention to a turret type punch press shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The punch press has an upper turret <b>1</b> and a lower turret <b>2</b> concentrically arranged in a frame <b>3</b>; the upper turret <b>1</b> is a support member for punch tools and the lower turret <b>2</b> is a support member for die tools. An indexing station of the upper turret <b>1</b> is provided with various punch tools <b>4</b>, and an indexing station of the lower turret <b>2</b> is provided with various die tools <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the upper turret <b>1</b> and lower turret <b>2</b> has a circular planar shape and is rotatable around a rotating center axis <b>7</b>. A turret moving device <b>8</b> rotatably moves the upper turret <b>1</b> and lower turret <b>2</b> to bring any of the punch tools <b>4</b> and any of the die tools <b>5</b> at a predetermined position P located on circumferences on which the indexing stations are arranged. The turret moving device <b>8</b> uses a common motor <b>9</b> for the upper turret <b>1</b> and lower turret <b>2</b> to transmit rotation to the upper turret <b>1</b> and lower turret <b>2</b> via chain mechanisms <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. The upper turret <b>1</b> and lower turret <b>2</b> may have a fan-shaped planar shape. The punch tools <b>4</b> and die tools <b>5</b> may be supported by a support member different from the turret. In this case, the turret moving device <b>8</b> is a punch die supporting member moving device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the punch tools <b>4</b>, provided on the upper turret <b>1</b>, is drivingly elevated and lowered at the punch position P by punch driving means <b>13</b>. The punch driving means <b>13</b> comprises a crank mechanism <b>14</b> and a ram <b>15</b> that is elevated and lowered by the crank mechanism <b>14</b>. The punch driving means <b>13</b> elevates and lowers the punch tool <b>4</b> via the ram <b>15</b>. Some of the die tools <b>5</b>, provided on the turret <b>2</b>, are forming dies <b>5</b> that can be elevated and lowered at the punch position by a die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b>, described later. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, for upward forming, each of the forming dies <b>5</b> has an upward protruding forming portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>that is combined with the recessed punch tool <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A workpiece W that is a plate material is fed by a workpiece feeding mechanism <b>17</b> in a fore-to-aft direction and a lateral direction on a workpiece table <b>18</b> so that its desired area is located at the punch position P. The workpiece feeding mechanism <b>17</b> feeds the workpiece W the end of which is gripped by a workpiece holder <b>17</b><i>a</i>. A workpiece holder <b>17</b><i>a </i>is attached to a cross slide <b>17</b><i>b </i>installed on a carriage <b>17</b><i>c </i>so as to be movable in a lateral (X) direction; the carriage <b>17</b><i>c </i>is movable on the frame <b>3</b> in a fore-to-aft (Y) direction. The workpiece table <b>18</b> is a planar table provided with sliding means such as a free bearing on which the workpiece W is placed for guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, each of the forming dies <b>5</b> is attached to the lower turret <b>2</b>, a die supporting member, via a die holding stand <b>20</b>. The die holding stand <b>20</b> has a counter sunk die attaching hole <b>21</b> formed in its central portion and which penetrates the die holding stand <b>20</b> in a vertical direction. The planar position of the die attaching hole <b>21</b> is aligned with a die inserting hole <b>22</b> formed in the lower turret <b>2</b> to fix the die holding stand <b>20</b> to a top surface of the lower turret <b>2</b> by bolts or the like. The forming die <b>5</b> is fitted and held in the die attaching hole <b>21</b> and die inserting hole <b>22</b> so as to be slidable in the vertical direction. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, the forming die <b>5</b> is slidable through the die inserting hole <b>22</b>. However, the forming die <b>5</b> is slidable through the die attaching hole <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 5</figref>, a forming portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>with a larger diameter normally engages with a counter sunk surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the die attaching hole <b>21</b>. In this condition, a lower end of the forming die <b>5</b> projects downward from the die inserting hole <b>22</b>. An engaging groove <b>5</b><i>b </i>shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> is formed in a side surface of a projecting lower end of the forming die <b>5</b>, in a radial direction of the lower turret <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A bolster <b>24</b> is provided in the vicinity of the punch position P and below the lower turret <b>2</b> to support the lower turret <b>2</b> from below so as to prevent the lower turret <b>2</b> from being distorted during punching. The bolster <b>24</b> receives a punch load and does not hamper the discharge of slag that may be generated during punching. In this example, the bolster <b>24</b> is composed of a pair of bolster members <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>arranged away from each other across the punch position P in the radial direction of the lower turret <b>2</b>. The radially outer bolster member <b>24</b><i>a </i>is shaped like a gate and has an opening <b>25</b> through which an elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> described below moves into and out of the bolster <b>24</b>. The paired bolster members <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>is provided at positions such that the projecting lower end of the forming die <b>5</b> does not interfere with the bolster members <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>during rotation of the lower turret <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Now, the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>. The die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b> comprises the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> that is switched by position switching means <b>31</b> between a position below the lower turret <b>2</b> and a retracting position away from the lower turret <b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the position switching means <b>31</b> is a cylinder that moves the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> along a rail <b>32</b> laid on the frame <b>3</b> in the direction (X direction) of a virtual straight line <b>33</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) joining the punch position P to the rotating center <b>7</b> of the lower turret <b>2</b>. During this movement, the position of the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is switched by moving it through the opening <b>25</b> of the radially outer bolster member <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is composed of a base member <b>34</b> that is movable on the rail <b>32</b>, an elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> supported on the base member <b>34</b> so as to freely elevate and lower and having a engaging protrusion <b>35</b><i>a </i>with a hook-shaped cross section which can engage with the engaging groove <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the forming die <b>5</b>, a pair of cam rollers <b>36</b> rotatably attached to the opposite side surfaces of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b>, a cam member <b>38</b> that is slidable in the X direction with respect to the base member <b>34</b>, the cam member <b>38</b> having a cam groove <b>37</b> that engages with the cam roller <b>36</b>, a cylinder type elevating and lowering driving member <b>39</b> that moves the cam member <b>38</b> in the X direction, and a cover <b>40</b> which is attached to an end surface of the cam member <b>38</b> which is closer to the turret rotating center and which can pass through the opening <b>25</b>, the cover <b>40</b> being almost as large as the opening <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a vertical shaft portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>is provided in the lower part of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b>. The shaft portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>is slidably fitted into an elevating and lowering member attaching hole <b>34</b><i>a </i>formed in the base member <b>34</b>, to support the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> to freely elevate from and lower toward the base member <b>34</b>. The cam member <b>38</b> is composed of a horizontally wide middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>and vertically tall opposite side portions <b>38</b><i>b</i>. A piston rod <b>39</b><i>a </i>of the cylinder constituting the elevating and lowering driving member <b>39</b> is coupled to a rear surface of the middle portion <b>38</b><i>a</i>, and the cam grooves <b>37</b> are formed in the respective side portions <b>38</b><i>b</i>. A top surface of the cam member middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>is formed level so as to constitute a surface on which the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is seated during pressing. A recessed portion <b>41</b> is formed in the cam member middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>so that when the cam member <b>38</b> advances toward the turret switching center, the shaft portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is fitted into the recessed portion <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cam groove <b>37</b> is composed of an inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>that becomes gradually lower as the inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>approaches the turret rotating center side, a horizontal portion <b>37</b><i>b </i>connected to that side of the inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>which is opposite the turret rotating center, and a step portion <b>37</b><i>c </i>further connected to that side of the horizontal portion <b>37</b><i>b </i>which is opposite the turret rotating center side, the step portion <b>37</b><i>c </i>being lower than the horizontal portion <b>37</b><i>b</i>. Advancing or retreating the cam member <b>38</b> in the X direction rolls the cam roller <b>36</b> along the cam groove <b>37</b> to change the height of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b>. Locating the cam roller <b>36</b> in the lowermost area of the inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>sets the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> at the lowest level L<b>2</b>. Locating the cam roller <b>36</b> in the horizontal portion <b>37</b><i>b </i>sets the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> at the highest level L<b>1</b>. Locating the cam roller <b>36</b> in the step portion <b>37</b><i>c </i>sets the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> at a machining level L<b>3</b> that is slightly lower than the highest level L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The operation of the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b> will be described. In an initial condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is located at a retracting position A outside the lower turret <b>2</b>. To carry out forming with the forming die <b>5</b>, the position switching means <b>31</b> is driven to move the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> to the position B below the lower turret <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At the position B below the lower turret <b>2</b>, the engaging protrusion <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> engages with the engaging groove <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the forming die <b>5</b>. The forming die <b>5</b>, and the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> are thus integrated together for vertical movement. At this time, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is at the lowest level L<b>1</b>, where the cam roller <b>36</b> is located in the lowermost area of the inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the cam groove <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Under these conditions, the elevating and lowering driving member <b>39</b> is driven to advance the cam member <b>38</b> to roll the cam roller <b>36</b> to the step portion <b>37</b><i>c </i>along the inclined portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the cam groove <b>37</b>, and then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> rises up to the machining level L<b>3</b>. Thus, the forming die <b>5</b> is lifted to locate the top surface of the forming die <b>5</b> above the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b>. When the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is at the machining level L<b>3</b>, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is supported by the middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the cam member <b>38</b> from below. To advance the cam member <b>38</b>, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> once rises up to the highest level L<b>2</b> and then lowers down to the slightly lower machining level L<b>3</b>. This allows the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> to be smoothly seated on the middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the cam member <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With the forming die <b>5</b> thus elevated to lift the workpiece W above the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b>, the punch tool <b>4</b> is lowered for forming (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). On this occasion, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> is supported by the middle portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the cam member <b>38</b> from below and can withstand even a heavy forming load. This also avoids imposing a heavy load on the cam roller <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After pressing, the above operations are reversed to lower the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> down to the lowest level L<b>1</b>. The elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is further retreated to the retracting position A. To carry out piercing, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is retreated to the retracting position A, and then, a suction device (not shown in the drawings) is used to suck and remove slag resulting from the piercing, from below the punch position P. Since the opening <b>25</b> is occluded by the cover <b>40</b> of the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b>, the area below the punch position P is so closed that slag can be efficiently sucked.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b>, when no forming dies <b>5</b> need to be elevated or lowered, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is located at the retracting position A outside the lower turret <b>2</b> which is a die supporting member. Consequently, even if forming dies are arranged on adjacent indexing stations, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is prevented from interfering with the forming dies <b>5</b> on the indexing station adjacent to the punch position P. This reduces the limitation on the number and positions of forming dies <b>5</b> attached to the lower turret <b>2</b>, and a plurality of forming dies <b>5</b> can thus be freely arranged on the lower turret <b>2</b> depending on operation type or procedure. Further, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is retracted to outside the lower turret <b>2</b> except when the forming dies <b>5</b> are elevated for punching. This prevents slag from adhering to the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b>, which can thus always operate appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The position of the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> is switched by moving the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> in the direction (X direction) of the virtual straight line <b>33</b> joining the punch position P to the turret rotating center <b>7</b>. During the position switching, the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> can pass through the opening <b>25</b>, formed in the bolster member <b>24</b><i>a</i>. This facilitates the position switching of the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b>. As a result, the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b> can be miniaturized and simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the elevating and lowering device <b>30</b> moves in the direction of the virtual straight line <b>33</b> joining the punch position P to the turret rotating center <b>7</b>, even if the lower turret <b>2</b> has the forming dies <b>5</b> on each of plural concentric circles <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the forming dies <b>5</b> on each of the concentric circles <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> can be elevated and lowered by one elevating and lowering device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a different die elevating and lowering driving device. This die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> also comprises an elevating and lowering device <b>50</b>. The elevating and lowering device <b>50</b> is switched by the position switching means <b>31</b> between the position below the lower turret <b>2</b> and the retracting position away from the lower turret <b>2</b>. The configuration of the elevating and lowering device <b>50</b> is slightly different from that in the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b>. A description will be given below of those components of the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> which are configured differently from the corresponding components of the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b>; components having the same configurations are denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b>, the elevating and lowering driving member is a servo motor <b>51</b>. The rotating power of the servo motor <b>51</b> rotates a ball screw <b>53</b> via a belt transmission device <b>52</b>. This moves a nut <b>54</b> threadably fitted around the ball screw <b>53</b> in a direction (Y direction) orthogonal to the direction (X direction) of the virtual straight line joining the punch position to the turret rotating center <b>7</b>. Moving the nut <b>54</b> in the Y direction advances or retreats the cam member <b>38</b> in the X direction via a rack and pinion mechanism composed of a first rack <b>56</b>, a pinion <b>57</b>, and a second rack <b>58</b>. Then, as is the case with the above embodiment, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> elevates or lowers via the cam mechanism composed of the cam roller <b>36</b> and cam groove <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first rack <b>56</b> is slidably engaged with a guide groove <b>54</b><i>a </i>formed in the nut <b>54</b> and extending in the X direction. Thus, as the elevating and lowering device <b>50</b> moves in the X direction for position switching, the first rack <b>56</b> moves along the guide groove <b>54</b><i>a</i>. When the first rack <b>56</b> is on an extension of axis of the ball screw <b>53</b>, the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b> elevates or lowers. This preferably prevents the nut <b>54</b> from being subjected to a bending moment, allowing the precise holding of the nut <b>54</b> and the ball screw <b>53</b>, threadably fitted around the nut <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this configuration, the elevating and lowering driving member <b>51</b> is the servo motor, which allows the easy control of elevating and lowering of the elevating and lowering member <b>35</b>. This enables the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> to fix the forming die <b>5</b> at a given position such that its top surface is higher than the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table and to lower the punch tool <b>4</b> for forming (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), similarly to the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>16</b>. The die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> can further fix the punch toll <b>4</b> at a given position such that its top surface is higher than the top surface <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece table <b>18</b> and elevate the forming die <b>5</b> for forming (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). During this forming, the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> can adjust the elevating end of the forming die <b>5</b> to set the formed part of the workpiece W at an arbitrary height. Further, since the elevating and lowering driving member <b>51</b> can be placed away from the virtual straight line, the length of the die elevating and lowering driving device <b>46</b> in the virtual straight line direction can be reduced.</p>
