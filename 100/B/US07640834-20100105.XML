<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Various types of sheet material, such as paper, typically are provided in the form of rolls of sheet material. Such a roll of sheet material typically incorporates a hollow core about which the sheet material is tightly wound. At times, such a roll of sheet material can be over six feet in length, over several feet in diameter and over several thousand pounds in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Rolls of sheet material typically are transported from a production facility, where the rolls are produced, to a manufacturing facility, where the rolls are loaded onto manufacturing equipment for manufacturing end products. Given that the rolls are cumbersome, some rolls tend to become damaged prior to use. Unfortunately, damaged rolls may cause problems. For example, if the sheet material is damaged, use of such a roll may result in lower quality end products. Therefore, it has become commonplace to trim damaged rolls so that the remaining undamaged portions of the rolls can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Damaged rolls are trimmed in a variety of manners. For example, one manner is to ship the damaged rolls off-site to a location where the rolls are trimmed. Clearly, this manner involves the time and expense associated with transporting the rolls from and then back to the manufacturing facility. Thus, on-site trimming may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One manner that accommodates on-site trimming involves positioning a roll of sheet material in a horizontal orientation. The roll is maintained in this orientation while a saw is moved around the perimeter of the stationary roll in order to remove the damaged portion of the roll. For instance, a system for trimming a roll of sheet material is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,719.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems and methods for trimming a roll of sheet material are provided. An embodiment of such a system comprises a core anchor that is configured to be inserted into the hollow core of a roll of sheet material and removably secured therein. The system also comprises a cutting tool rotatably attached to the core anchor. During trimming of a roll of sheet material to which the core anchor is secured, the core anchor rotates with the roll as the roll is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of a system for trimming a roll of sheet material comprises a shaft, a guide and a cutting tool. The shaft includes a first portion and a second portion, with the first portion being configured to be inserted into the hollow core of a roll of sheet material and removably secured therein. The second portion is configured to protrude from the core. The guide is rotatably mounted to the second portion of the shaft, and the cutting tool is movably mounted to the guide. In this regard, movement of the cutting tool along the guide changes a distance between the cutting tool and the shaft. During trimming of a roll of sheet material to which the shaft is secured, the shaft rotates with the roll as the roll is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of a method for trimming a roll of sheet material comprises: positioning a roll of sheet material in a substantially horizontal orientation; securing, within the hollow core of the roll, an end of a rotatable shaft, a cutting tool being rotatably attached to the shaft such that the cutting tool is rotatable, relative to the shaft, within a plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the shaft; rotating the roll of sheet material while an end of the shaft is secured within the hollow core, such that the shaft rotates with the roll, while maintaining the roll in the substantially horizontal orientation; and cutting the sheet material with the cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other systems and methods will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems and methods be protected by the accompanying claims.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Systems and methods for trimming rolls of sheet material are provided. In this regard, trimming is achieved while rotating the roll. Specifically, in some embodiments, the roll is rotated about its longitudinal axis while in a substantially horizontal orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Movement of a cutting tool, which cuts the roll while the roll is being rotated, is substantially matched to that of the roll during trimming. Since a roll of sheet material rarely (if ever) is perfectly round, the end of the roll that is being trimmed tends to move in various directions as the roll is rotated. Thus, matching the movement potentially results in a superior trimming of the roll.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Matching the movement, i.e. the non-rotational movement, of the roll of sheet material to that of the cutting tool is accomplished by use of a core anchor. In particular, a core anchor is inserted into and secured within the hollow core of the roll of sheet material that is to be trimmed. The cutting tool is configured to move in some respects with the core anchor, as is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of an embodiment of a system for trimming a roll of sheet material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> comprises a core anchor <b>102</b> that is configured to be inserted within the hollow core <b>104</b> of a roll of sheet material <b>106</b>. Specifically, the core anchor is configured to be removably secured within the hollow core so that, when the roll is rotated about its longitudinal axis <b>108</b> (indicated by arrow A), the core anchor rotates with the roll. A cutting tool <b>110</b> is adapted to rotatably engage the core anchor so that, as the core anchor rotates along with the roll, a position of the cutting tool can be substantially maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the portion of the cutting tool <b>110</b> that actually cuts the sheet material, in this case a saw blade <b>112</b>, is also configured to move relative to the core anchor. Specifically, the saw blade is able to move (indicated by arrow B) along a guide <b>114</b> (rotation of the saw blade is indicated by arrow C). Note also that rotation of the roll and the saw blade can be in either direction. Guide <b>114</b> generally restricts movement of the saw blade within a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the core anchor. For instance, when the core anchor is secured within the core of the roll of sheet material, the guide generally restricts movement of the saw blade along a radius <b>116</b> of the roll of sheet material. Thus, movement of the saw blade along the guide and toward the core anchor enables the sheet material to be cut. In this manner, damaged portions of the sheet material and/or core can be trimmed from the roll.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Note also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that the end <b>118</b> of the roll of sheet material has been scored, such as with a circular saw, to exhibit groove <b>120</b>. Scoring typically is accomplished prior to trimming the roll so that portions of the sheet material that are separated from the roll by the cutting tool fall away from the roll. In particular, the portions fall away from the roll in the form of ribbons <b>122</b>. As these ribbons are removed, the saw blade can be moved closer to the core for cutting inner portions of the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of a roll-trimming assembly that can be used in a system for trimming rolls of sheet material is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, roll-trimming assembly <b>130</b> includes a core anchor <b>132</b> and a cutting tool <b>134</b>. In this embodiment, the core anchor is generally configured as a shaft <b>136</b> that includes a first portion <b>138</b>, which is adapted to be removably secured within a hollow core of a roll of sheet material, and a second portion <b>140</b>, which is configured to facilitate attachment of the cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Attachment of the cutting tool <b>134</b> to the core anchor <b>132</b> is facilitated by first and second bushings <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. The bushings are spaced from each other and mounted to a mounting plate <b>146</b>. The mounting plate is affixed to a guide <b>148</b> that facilitates movement of the cutting tool both toward and away from the core anchor. In this embodiment, the guide is a dual-tracked rail assembly that is engaged by a carriage <b>150</b>. Specifically, the guide incorporates rails <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> that are spaced from each other and which extend outwardly from the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each rail incorporates a toothed track <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> that is engaged by the carriage for permitting the carriage to advance incrementally along the guide. The carriage <b>150</b> is configured to move along the tracks of the guide using gears (not shown) so that the cutting tool, which in this case includes a circular saw blade <b>151</b>, can be moved toward the core anchor <b>132</b> during a trimming operation. Movement of the carriage along the guide is facilitated by an operator grasping handles <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and urging the carriage in an intended direction of travel, such as between the positions indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In other embodiments, the carriage can be automatically driven with a gear system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The guide <b>148</b> is suspended from a support member <b>164</b>. The support member generally supports the weight of the guide and carriage while enabling the cutting tool to match the non-rotational movement of a rotating roll of sheet material to which the core anchor <b>132</b> is secured. In this embodiment, the support member includes a support linkage <b>166</b> that is mounted between brackets <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>, bracket <b>168</b> being attached to the guide. The brackets allow the support linkage to pivot in various directions thereby supporting the cutting tool in a variety of orientations. Bracket <b>170</b> of the support member is attached to a frame member <b>171</b>, which will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, various other types of support members can be used. By way of example, a chain can be used, such as a chain extending between the frame member and the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a vacuum nozzle <b>172</b> is attached to the carriage <b>150</b>. The vacuum nozzle is used to draw dust and/or other particles produced during a trimming operation away from the cutting tool. Use of the vacuum nozzle tends to prevent fouling of the cutting tool, and can significantly reduce the amount of dust that would otherwise spread from the area of the trimming operation. Since such a trimming operation can take place on-site, i.e. at a facility where the rolls of sheet material are used for manufacturing products, the ability to reduce errant dust can be quite desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the carriage <b>150</b> includes a ribbon guard <b>174</b> that extends generally upwardly and outwardly from the cutting tool. In particular for this embodiment, the ribbon guard extends away from the cutting tool in a direction that generally opposes the intended direction of rotation (indicated by arrow D) of the roll sheet material that is to be trimmed. So configured, the ribbon guard can deflect ribbons of sheet material that are cut away from the roll so that the cutting tool does not become obstructed by the ribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another embodiment of a core anchor is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, core anchor <b>180</b> is generally configured as a shaft. The core anchor includes a set of lugs, each of which moves with respect to the shaft. In particular, this embodiment includes two sets of lugs <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, with each set including three lugs for a total of six. Each of the lugs within a set are angularly displaced from an adjacent lug by approximately 120&#xb0;. Additionally, the lugs of set <b>182</b> are offset with respect to the lugs of set <b>184</b> such that, as viewed from an end of the shaft, there is a lug located at approximately each 60&#xb0; interval about a circumference of the core anchor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the lugs <b>186</b>A-F are adapted to move from retracted positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to extended positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for securing the core anchor within a hollow core of a roll of sheet material. Specifically, inner surfaces <b>188</b>A-F of the lugs pneumatically communicate with an air manifold <b>190</b> located within the shaft. When sufficient air pressure is provided to the air manifold, such as via fitting <b>192</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the lugs are forced radially outwardly to their extended positions. In the extended positions, outer end surfaces <b>194</b>A-F of the lugs engage corresponding portions of the inner surface of the hollow core of the roll into which the core anchor has been inserted. It should be noted that, although the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> uses pneumatically actuated lugs, various other forms of actuation, such as hydraulic, can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the lugs can be adapted to accommodate various inner diameters of cores. This can be accomplished by providing removable lugs of various sizes that can be changed based on the size of the core into which the core anchor is to be inserted. For instance, a shaft using shorter lugs than those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Additionally or alternatively, each lug can be adapted to mate with a lug extension for effectively changing the size of the lug. Clearly, various sizes, shapes, numbers and arrangements of lugs, other than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another embodiment of a system for trimming a roll of sheet material is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, system <b>200</b> comprises a frame assembly <b>202</b>, a roll-trimming assembly <b>204</b>, a dust-collecting assembly <b>206</b>, a roll-stabilizing assembly <b>208</b> and a roll-positioning assembly <b>210</b>. Note, a roll of sheet material <b>211</b> is positioned on the system for trimming (depicted in phantom lines).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, frame assembly <b>202</b> includes a generally rectangular base frame <b>212</b> and a support frame <b>214</b>. The support frame extends upwardly from the base frame and is used to mount a frame member <b>216</b> for suspending the roll-trimming assembly. Various other assemblies and/or components also are mounted to the support frame, such as an electrical sub-assembly <b>220</b>. Note that an hydraulic sub-assembly <b>222</b> (the pump of which is powered by the electrical sub-assembly) and a pneumatic sub-assembly (not shown) are not attached to the frame in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An underside of the base frame <b>212</b> incorporates wheels, such as wheel <b>226</b>, to permit movement of the entire system. Notably, the system <b>200</b> is sized for transport by vehicle so that the system can be delivered on-site for performing trimming operations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> incorporates removable legs, such as leg <b>230</b>, that can be installed for provided extra support to the frame and removed for transport.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Frame assembly <b>202</b> also supports a set of rollers <b>231</b>-<b>234</b>. The rollers are used to support and rotate a roll <b>240</b> of sheet material that is to be trimmed. Specifically, the rollers support the roll in a substantially horizontal orientation and rotate the roll about a longitudinal axis <b>242</b>. Note that, although this embodiment uses four rollers, various other numbers and arrangements of rollers can be used. Additionally, in this embodiment, there are only two drive rollers. That is, only rollers <b>232</b> and <b>334</b> are driven by a motor <b>244</b> for rotating the roll. Note that the motor in this embodiment is an hydraulic motor controlled by the hydraulic sub-assembly <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The roll-stabilizing assembly <b>208</b> is attached to the base frame. The roll-stabilizing assembly includes a movable support arm <b>250</b> and a wheel <b>252</b>. Specifically, the support arm is configured to move along a length of the base frame to accommodate various lengths of rolls of sheet material. The wheel is attached to and positioned by the support arm so that the wheel contacts the end of the roll of sheet material that is to be trimmed. In this position, the roll-stabilizing assembly tends to maintain a longitudinal position of the roll of sheet material upon the set of rollers. Thus, the roll does not back away from the cutting tool during trimming. Notably, the wheel turns as the roll of sheet material is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The dust-collecting assembly <b>206</b> includes a vacuum <b>260</b> with an integrated filter. A vacuum duct <b>262</b> extends from the vacuum to a vacuum nozzle <b>264</b>, which is located in a vicinity of the cutting tool <b>266</b>. The vacuum duct also extends to a dust collection bin <b>268</b> that is located beneath the cutting tool. So provided, the dust collection bin and the vacuum nozzle collect dust and/or other particles due to the flow of air created by vacuum <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (in which various components such as the rollers are removed), the roll-positioning assembly <b>210</b> is located to be between the rollers. The roll-positioning assembly is used to position a roll of sheet material so that the roll is properly oriented upon the frame assembly for trimming.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, this embodiment of the roll-positioning assembly includes a roll cradle <b>280</b> that has an upper surface <b>282</b> for engaging an outer surface of the roll sheet material. The roll cradle is hydraulically actuated by components located beneath the roll cradle. In operation, the roll cradle can be moved vertically and/or horizontally. Thus, the combination of vertical lifting of the roll and horizontal displacement of the roll enables the roll-positioning assembly to position a roll of sheet material properly upon the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to perform trimming of a roll of sheet material using a system, such as one of the embodiments depicted herein, a roll of sheet material is positioned in a substantially horizontal orientation. The end of a rotatable shaft to which a cutting tool is rotatably attached is secured within the hollow core of the roll. Notably, the cutting tool rotates within a plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the shaft. The roll of sheet material is then rotated while the end of the shaft is secured within the hollow core so that the shaft rotates with the roll, and while maintaining the roll in the substantially horizontal orientation. The sheet material is then cut with the cutting tool. Optionally, the cutting tool can be replaced by an abrading tool, such as an abrasive disk, and the end of the roll that has been trimmed can be smoothed by the abrading tool.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be emphasized that many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and protected by the following claims.</p>
