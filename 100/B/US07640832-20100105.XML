<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to automotive vehicle brake lathes configured for resurfacing brake rotor components, and in particular, to an improved on-car brake lathe apparatus and a method for compensating for runout between an on-car brake lathe and a vehicle wheel hub to which the on-car brake lathe is secured for a brake rotor resurfacing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the main components of a vehicle wheel braking system employing rotor brakes are the brake rotors, which provide a solid rotating surface against which the stationary brake friction pads are clamped or compressed to generate a frictional force, slowing the rotational movement of the brake rotors and the associated vehicle wheels. The brake rotors are subjected to repeated and substantial frictional forces by the brake friction pads, and over time, become worn. Uneven application of braking force, debris, or uneven frictional surfaces on the brake friction pads can result in the formation of grooves, channels, or scratches in the surfaces of the brake rotors. Repeated heating and cooling of the brake rotor resulting in extreme temperature variations can additionally result in the lateral warping of the brake rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A worn or warped brake rotor may be resurfaced by cutting or grinding to provide a uniform smooth brake friction pad contact surface if sufficient brake rotor material remains to provide an adequate braking surface without compromising the structural integrity of the vehicle braking system. However, once a brake rotor has been worn below a minimum safe thickness, it is unable to safely dissipate the heat generated by a brake application, and must be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To provide for a uniform surface, any abnormalities in the brake rotor, such as a lateral warping must be detected and removed during the resurfacing procedures. An additional source of lateral warping defects in a brake rotor or brake rotor is often over tightened attachment bolts or an uneven mounting surface onto which the brake rotor is secured in the vehicle wheel assembly. If the brake rotor is removed from the vehicle wheel assembly for a resurfacing operation on a fixed or &#x201c;bench&#x201d; brake lathe any abnormalities or defects resulting from the mounting of the brake rotor to the vehicle wheel assembly may not be accurately identified or corrected during the resurfacing procedure. Accordingly, a variety of brake resurfacing machines or brake lathes have been developed to resurface brake rotors while they remain mounted to the vehicle wheel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Brake resurfacing machines or brake lathes configured to resurface brake rotors mounted to a vehicle wheel assembly are commonly referred to as on-car brake lathes. Examples of an on-car brake lathe include the OCL-360 and OCL-400 brake lathes sold by Hunter Engineering Co. of Bridgeton, Mo. By eliminating the need to remove the brake rotor from the vehicle wheel assembly, the overall efficiency of the resurfacing procedure is improved, and the chances for operator induced error are reduced. However, the resurfacing of brake rotors which remain mounted to the vehicle wheel assembly requires that the on-car brake lathe and the vehicle wheel assembly, including the brake rotor, be aligned along a common axis, typically, the rotational axis of the vehicle wheel assembly hub onto which the on-car brake lathe is secured.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Often, the hub surface to which the vehicle wheel assembly mounts is not aligned within a required tolerance to the axis of rotation for the axle upon which the vehicle wheel assembly is secured. This deviation between the hub surface and the axis of rotation for the wheel assembly is referred to as lateral runout, and must be compensated for either manually or automatically before beginning the resurfacing procedures with the on-car brake lathe.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Manual runout compensation procedures are tedious and complex. First, an operator secures the output spindle of the on-car brake lathe to the vehicle wheel hub using a suitable adapter. Next, a motor in the on-car brake lathe is activated to rotate the output spindle, the adapter, and brake rotor. Any runout present in the system is directly measured by one or more measurement devices, which provide the operator with a suitable visual indication representative of the actual runout experienced by the on-car brake lathe as the adapter is rotated through one or more complete rotations. Using the visual indication, the operator manually adjusts one or more mechanical adjustment elements, such as screws or dials, altering the rotational axis of the on-car brake lathe output spindle to reduce the observed runout to within an acceptable tolerance for performing the resurfacing of the brake rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To reduce the observed runout to within the desired tolerances using the manual runout compensation procedure usually requires several iterations when carried out by a skilled operator. The extra time spent by an operator to setup the on-car brake lathe and perform the manual runout compensation can substantially increase the time required to complete a brake rotor resurfacing, resulting in a corresponding increase in cost and lost productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a number of on-car brake lathe devices have been configured with active automatic runout compensation mechanisms which do not require significant operator input. Such active automatic runout compensation mechanisms are shown in European Patent Application No. 1 0172 343 A1 to Costruzioni Mechaniche Caorle S.p.A., based on Italian Patent No. 0248591 Y1, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,101,911 to Newell et al. The automatic runout compensation mechanism shown in the '911 Newell et al. patent includes at least one adjustment rotor interposed between a pair of adapters and which is concentric about an axial drive shaft. The on-car brake lathe motor and cutting elements are secured to one adapter, and the entire mechanism secured to the vehicle wheel hub via the second adapter. The adjustment rotor includes a slanted surface in engagement with either a second adjustment rotor having an opposing slanted surface or one of the adapters. An adjustment mechanism is utilized to alter the rotational orientation of the adjustment rotor about the axis of the axial drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As the components of the '911 Newell et al. automatic runout compensation mechanism are rotated about the axis at a fixed speed of 120 PRM, runout is detected by an accelerometer. A processor receives an output signal from the accelerometer and provides corresponding control signals to an adjustment mechanism. Alteration of the rotation position of the adjustment rotor about the axis of the axial drive shaft as the components are rotated at the relatively high fixed rotational speed of 120 RPM compensates for the detected runout by attempting to alter the angle at which the two slanted surfaces are engaged, and correspondingly the angle between the first and second adapters. Due to significant high speed vibrations and the interaction of the various rotating components, such as bearings, gears, and shaft, errors are induced in the automatic runout compensation sensor signals. Thus, automatic runout compensation typically requires several complete rotations of the various components about the axis before the adjustment rotor rotational position is sufficiently altered to compensate for any detected runout.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The automated adjustment mechanism of the '911 Newell et al. patent associated with the use of the one or more slant rotors is a costly and complex mechanical arrangement. The mechanism requires an initial phasing or alignment of the adjustment rotors, followed by a lengthy trial-and-error adjustment process to compensate for any detected runout.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, there is a need for on-car brake lathes having improved precision runout compensation mechanisms, which are not subjected to rotational movement noise and vibrations during runout measurements, and which can quickly and accurately compensate for detected runout, but which do not require complex and costly components.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With conventional on-car brake lathes, it is necessary to invert the orientation of the lathe when switching between sides of a vehicle. Inverting the lathe inverts the operator control panel, and can render the operation of the controls difficult, particularly as the number of controls or displays increased. Accordingly, there is a further need for an on-car brake lathe having a control panel which is adjustable so as to be presentable to an operator at a selected orientation, independent of the orientation of the on-car brake lathe.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Traditionally, on-car and bench brake lathes utilize motors or drive systems configured for operation at a fixed spindle RPM and feed rate. During rotor cutting or resurfacing, a resonance or vibration, commonly referred to as &#x201c;chatter&#x201d;, can develop between the rotor cutting tools and the rotor surface, resulting at best in an uneven resurfacing of the brake rotor, or at worst, in severe damage to the rotor surface or rotor cutting tools themselves. Accordingly, the fixed spindle RPM and feed rates in traditional on-car and bench brake lathes are selected to be below the rates at which the resonance or vibration is likely to occur. Alternatively, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,591,720 B1 to Greenwald et al., vibration damping or attenuating components such as pads or elastomeric bands are brought into contact with the brake rotor during resurfacing to control or reduce undesired &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; resonance or vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Since it is known that &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; vibrations or resonances are a function of the spindle RPM, feed rates, and depth of the resurfacing cut, it would be advantageous to provide on-car and bench brake lathes with a reliable system to detect the presence of &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; vibrations or resonance during the cutting of the rotor, and to configure the brake lathes with one or more automatic adjustments to reduce or eliminate the vibrations before it affects the quality of the surface finish on the rotor. Since the rates at which the resonance or vibration are likely to occur vary for brake rotors of different sizes, thicknesses, and materials, it would be advantageous to provide an on-car brake lathe which is capable of varying the spindle RPM during the resurfacing of a brake rotor and, optionally, the linear feed rate of the cutting implements, up to a maximum rate at which a desired brake rotor resurfacing quality can be achieved, thereby reducing operator time require to resurface a brake rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is desirable to create a brake resurfacing system that will sense when the cut is completed and automatically stop the operation of the brake lathe, thereby reducing the time required for the operator to prepare the brake lathe to cut the next rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some vehicles are equipped with locking differentials in the vehicle drive train that engage when a difference in wheel rotational speed from one side of the vehicle to the other reaches approximately 100 RPM. When the locking mechanism engages, as may occur during rotation of a brake rotor by an on-car brake lathe, the resulting change in rotational resistance can violently rotate the entire on-car lathe body. It is desirable to provide an on-car brake lathe with safety features configured to automatically stop the lathe rotation if a sudden resistance is encountered in the cut.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With a wide variety of information related to vehicle specifications, including brake rotor thicknesses and dimensions, it would be advantageous to provide a brake lathe system with a communications interface by which the lathe can acquire at least vehicle specifications from a data network or other automotive service device. It is also desired that this communication system would be able to send data to a remote printer or console.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">U.S. Pat. No. 6,363,821 B1 to Greenwald et al. discloses a vehicle brake lathe incorporating cutting tip contact sensors to provide signals to a controlling microprocessor to facilitate automated movement of the cutting tips relative to a brake rotor surface, as well as a determination of a depth of cut. However, the '821 Greenwald et al. patent does not appear to provide the brake lathe operator with a simple and efficient indication of contact between each individual cutting tip and the brake rotor surface. Accordingly, there is a need to provide improved feedback from an operating brake lathe to an operator, permitting proper adjustments of the cutting tips for depth of cut and runout measurement during rotor resurfacing, and ensuring proper engagement between a visually occluded cutting tip and a brake rotor surface without requiring an operator to move to within close proximity of rotating components during an adjustment or resurfacing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to identifying contact between the cutting tips and a brake rotor surface, it is useful to provide a displayed measure of a depth of cut provided by the cutting tips. U.S. Pat. No. 6,363,821 B1 to Greenwald et al. provides a displayed depth of cut utilizing a displacement gauge positioned relative to each tool holder on a brake lathe. The displacement gauge in the '821 Greenwald, et al. patent directly measures the spatial separation or displacement between the two tool holders. To obtain a depth of cut measurement, an initial separation distance between the cutting bits is compared with a subsequent separation distance after a depth of cut adjustment has been made to a cutting bit. The calculated change in separation distance corresponds to the change in depth of cut of the cutting bit from the initial position plus the depth of cut for the opposite cutting bit (which is zero if it has not yet been adjusted). Hence, the position of both tool holders must be monitored to provide a depth of cut measurement for a single tool holder. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a simplified depth-of-cut measurement system for a single tool holder on a brake lathe which does not require information related to the position of a second tool holder, or a measurement of displacement between a pair of tool holders, to provide a depth of cut measurement.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Briefly stated, the present invention is an improved brake lathe system for the resurfacing of work pieces such as vehicle brake rotors. The improved brake lathe system is configured with a variable speed variable speed spindle motor and controller for regulating at least the work piece cutting rate and providing automatic shutdown of the brake lathe system when predetermined conditions are met, such as completion of a brake rotor resurfacing cut or detection of an abnormal operating condition.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an alternate embodiment, a brake lathe of the present invention incorporates a variable speed spindle motor as a drive motor. Sensors incorporated into the brake lathe are configured to detect vibrations generated by the cutting tips when in contact with the work piece or brake rotor surface, and provide a feedback signal which is utilized to control the variable speed spindle motor RPM and optionally, the linear feed rate of the cutting tips. Preferably, the variable speed spindle motor is operated to provide a maximum RPM and feed rate at which the cutting tip vibrations are maintained below a predetermined threshold. The sensor signal will fall to a minimum level when the cut has ended, signaling the motor controller to stop operations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, an on-car brake lathe is provided with a precision runout compensation system. The precision runout compensation system automatically directs a variable speed spindle motor to rotate the wheel coupling components of the on-car brake lathe to, and stops at, at least three discrete positions about an axis of rotation to obtain runout measurements after the on-car brake lathe has been coupled to a brake rotor. A sinusoidal representation of the runout present between the on-car brake lathe drive axis and the brake rotor rotational axis is calculated, and the variable speed spindle motor is again activated to rotate to, and stop the wheel coupling components at an adjustment position at which a single operator adjustment to the wheel coupling components can compensate for the runout present between the brake rotor and the wheel coupling components of the on-car brake lathe.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an alternate embodiment, a brake lathe of the present invention incorporates a cutting tip contact indicator to provide an operator with a visual or audible indication of contact between each cutting tip and a surface of a workpiece or brake rotor. Each cutting tip is electrically coupled, through a power source, to an indicator circuit and to an electrical ground. Contact between a cutting tip and the workpiece or brake rotor provides a complete electrical circuit between the electrical ground and the power source, resulting in an electrical current flow through an associated indicator circuit. Preferably, the associated indicator circuit incorporates one or more LEDs, which are correspondingly illuminated to provide the operator with a visual confirmation of contact between the cutting tip and the workpiece or brake rotor surface.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an alternate embodiment, an on-car brake lathe of the present invention incorporates a cutting tip contact indicator to provide an operator with a visual or audible indication of contact between each cutting tip and a surface of a workpiece or brake rotor. Sensors incorporated into the on-car brake lathe are configured to detect vibrations generated by a cutting tip in contact with the workpiece or brake rotor surface, and provide a feedback signal which is utilized to correspondingly illuminate one or more LEDs to provide the operator with a visual confirmation of contact between the cutting tip and the workpiece or brake rotor surface, or an audible indication thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternate embodiment, an on-car brake lathe of the present invention provides the operator with a depth of cut display. The information shown on the depth of cut display is based on signals received from a rotary encoder operatively coupled to the end of a threaded shaft upon which the cutting blade tool holders are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an alternate embodiment, an on-car brake lathe of the present invention provides the operator with a rotor runout display. The information shown on the rotor runout display is based on signals received from a rotary encoder operatively coupled to the end of a threaded shaft upon which the cutting blade tool holders are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an alternate embodiment, a brake lathe of the present invention is configured with a processor and associated communications circuits for exchanging information with one or more automotive service devices, such as a vehicle wheel aligner, vehicle wheel balancer, or automotive shop management system. The brake lathe is preferably configured to receive brake rotor specifications, such as diameter and thickness, and may be configured to communicate brake rotor resurfacing results to a display on the lathe or a remotely disposed printer or console. The processor may be further configured to utilize the received brake rotor specifications to establish limits on the range of movement for the cutting blade tool holders, or to establish an initial cutting speed and/or feed rate for a variable speed variable speed spindle motor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternate embodiment, a brake lathe of the present invention is configured with a control panel which is adjusted about an axis of rotation, to an orientation selected by the operator for ideal use and viewing independent of an orientation of the lathe body.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The following detailed description illustrates the invention by way of example and not by way of limitation. The description clearly enables one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives, and uses of the invention, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown mounted to a transport trolley <b>12</b> for positioning adjacent a vehicle to be worked on (not shown). The on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> includes a support structure <b>14</b>, onto which is mounted a variable speed drive spindle motor <b>16</b>, a an adjustable cutting head <b>18</b>, and an output spindle <b>20</b>. The variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> is coupled to the output spindle <b>20</b> through a conventional drive mechanism (not shown) contained within the support structure <b>14</b>, to rotate the output spindle <b>20</b> about a drive axis DA, and to linearly feed the cutting head <b>18</b> through a predetermined cutting range CR. An aligning joint <b>22</b> is secured to the output spindle <b>20</b>, concentric with the drive axis DA, and include an adapter <b>23</b> adapted to couple the output spindle <b>20</b> to a vehicle wheel hub or brake assembly (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally included on the support structure <b>14</b> is an operator console or electrical enclosure <b>24</b>. An operator interface <b>26</b> is mounted to the electrical enclosure <b>24</b>. The operator interface <b>26</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, preferably includes at least a bar graph LED display <b>28</b> and a numerical LED display <b>30</b>, and may optionally include one or more additional visual display elements <b>32</b> configured to provide the operator with information associated with the operation of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>. For example, multiple visual display elements <b>32</b> in the form of single LED lights may be disposed on the operator interface <b>26</b> to assist an operator in performing a runout compensation procedure when coupling the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> with a vehicle brake assembly, or to indicate the presence of a chatter condition during a resurfacing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order for the adjustable cutting head <b>18</b>, consisting of a pair of cutting tool holders <b>19</b>, to engage a vehicle brake assembly (not shown), it is necessary for the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> to be positioned to avoid interference with the vehicle brake caliper, vehicle suspension components, and vehicle body surfaces adjacent the vehicle brake assembly. Accordingly, it is often necessary to utilize the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> in an upright position when resurfacing brake rotors on one side of a vehicle, and to utilize the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> in an inverted position when resurfacing brake rotors on the opposite side of the vehicle. To facilitate operator access to the operator interface <b>26</b>, the electrical enclosure <b>24</b> is rotationally coupled to the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> about a shaft <b>35</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and is adjustable about a rotational axis EA of the shaft <b>35</b>, parallel to the drive axis DA, so as to present the operator interface <b>26</b> at a selected orientation, independent of the orientation of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This enables the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> to be utilized in either an upright configuration, or in an inverted configuration, shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as is sometimes required to facilitate engagement of the adjustable cutting head <b>18</b> with a vehicle wheel brake rotors.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, operator input controls <b>34</b> are additionally included on the operator interface <b>26</b>. The operator input controls <b>34</b> preferably include at least a start button <b>34</b>A, a stop button <b>34</b>B, a spindle speed control knob <b>34</b>C, a compensation button <b>34</b>D, and a runout test button <b>34</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Included within the electrical enclosure <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a processor board <b>36</b> and motor controller <b>38</b>. The processor board <b>36</b> incorporates a microprocessor <b>40</b>, which may be a micro-controller, digital signal processor, or other logic circuit having sufficient capacity to control the functions of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, and is configured to access and execute instruction sets stored in a suitable electronic memory <b>40</b>A, such as a RAM, ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the microprocessor <b>40</b> is operatively coupled to the motor controller <b>38</b> and to an LED drive circuit <b>42</b> for controlling the operation of the LED bar graph display <b>28</b>, LED numeric display <b>30</b>, and any additional visual display elements <b>32</b>. The microprocessor <b>40</b> is additionally operatively coupled to receive signals from the operator input controls <b>34</b>. One or more data lines <b>44</b> operatively couple the microprocessor <b>40</b> to the motor controller <b>38</b>. The data lines <b>44</b> may optionally include a digital to analog converter circuit <b>46</b>, and/or an analog optical isolator circuit <b>48</b>, depending upon the particular input requirements of the motor controller <b>38</b>. The motor controller <b>38</b> is in turn, coupled to the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> to provide electrical power to the motor windings (not shown), thereby controlling the motor output.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As is further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may be operatively coupled to receive input from, or exchange data with, one or more additional components of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> during operation of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, as is described below. These components may include, but not limited to, a motor shaft rotational position encoder <b>50</b>, a lathe tilt angle sensor <b>52</b>, an vibration sensor or accelerometer <b>54</b>, a communications circuit <b>56</b> such as an RS422 port, or other optional encoder circuits <b>58</b>, or an inclinometer <b>62</b>. A suitable power supply <b>60</b> for the microprocessor <b>40</b> and associated circuits, such as a transformer or AC/DC converter, is provided on the processor board <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preferably the microprocessor <b>40</b> is configured to monitor the rotational speed of the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> using the motor shaft rotational position encoder <b>50</b>, which is operatively coupled to the shaft of the motor engaged with the output spindle <b>20</b>. A representation of the rotational speed of the motor <b>16</b> may be displayed to an operator by the microprocessor <b>40</b> using either the LED bar graph display <b>28</b> or the LED numeric display <b>30</b>. The microprocessor <b>40</b> regulates the input signal representative of a desired rotational speed to the motor controller <b>38</b>, and adjusts the input signal in order to reach or maintain a desired rotational speed or torque of the output spindle <b>20</b>. The output signal of the motor shaft rotational position encoder <b>50</b> is further utilized by the microprocessor <b>40</b> to monitor and control the rotational position of the output spindle <b>20</b> about an arc of less than 360 degrees, such as for use during runout compensation procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to providing control signals to the motor controller <b>38</b> in response to signals from the motor shaft rotational position encoder <b>50</b>, the microprocessor is preferably configured to provide motor speed controls signals in response to signals received from a potentiometer <b>42</b> coupled to the spindle speed control knob <b>34</b>C, permitting an operator to manually indicate or select a desired rotational speed for the motor <b>16</b> and/or output spindle <b>20</b>. A representation of either the actual rotational speed of the motor <b>16</b>, or the desired rotational speed as indicated by an operator using the spindle speed control knob <b>34</b>C, may be displayed on either the LED bar graph display <b>28</b> or the LED numeric display <b>30</b> by the microprocessor <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The microprocessor <b>40</b> monitors an output from the tilt angle sensor <b>52</b> during the lathe runout compensation procedures and during normal operation of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>.

For example, if a vehicle locking differential engages during a brake rotor resurfacing procedure with the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> coupled to the vehicle wheel hub, the resulting change in rotating mass can cause the on-car brake lathe to rotate violently about the drive axis DA, potentially causing serious injury to an operator, damage to the vehicle, or damage to the on-car lathe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an alternate embodiment, the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> is provided with a simple tilt sensitive switch (not shown) which is responsive to the inclination of the on-car brake lathe structure to switch between an engaged and disengaged configuration.

Upon inclination of the on-car brake lathe structure beyond a predetermined inclination, the tilt sensitive switch stops a flow of electrical current to the motor <b>16</b> as a safety measure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">During a workpiece or brake rotor resurfacing procedure, undesired &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; resonance or vibrations may occur which can result in poor quality resurfacing of the brake rotor surface by the cutting head <b>18</b>, or damage to either the brake rotor or brake lathe components. The &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; resonance or vibrations are a function of the spindle RPM, the cutting head linear feed rate, and the depth of cut by the cutting tips.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, an on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> of the present invention configured with a variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b>, is operated during a brake resurfacing procedure by the microprocessor <b>40</b>, at a maximum spindle RPM and linear feed rate for the cutting tips at which the cutting tip vibrations are maintained below a predetermined threshold, i.e. below an acceptable &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; level. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the microprocessor <b>40</b> may be configured to begin a brake resurfacing procedure at a maximum spindle RPM and/or linear feed rate, and reduce the rate until the cutting tip vibrations are maintained below a predetermined threshold, i.e. below an acceptable &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; level. Alternatively, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may be configured to begin the brake resurfacing procedure at a low or minimum spindle RPM and/or linear feed rate, and increase the rate until the cutting tip vibrations exceed a predetermined threshold, i.e. an acceptable &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; level, at which point the microprocessor <b>40</b> directs the motor controller to reduce the rate.</p>

Next, the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> is moved into position such that the aligning joint <b>22</b> and drive axis DA are substantially co-linear with a central axis of the rotor-mounted adapter <b>77</b>, substantially corresponding to a rotational axis of the vehicle wheel brake rotor <b>75</b>. A threaded retaining shaft (not shown) is passed axially through the support structure <b>14</b> and output spindle <b>20</b>, and engaged with an axial threaded receiving bore (not shown) in the rotor-mounted adapter <b>77</b>. Tightening of the threaded retaining shaft seats the rotor-mounted adapter <b>77</b> against the aligning joint <b>22</b>, and secures the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> to the vehicle wheel brake rotor <b>75</b> to be resurfaced, enabling the vehicle wheel brake rotor <b>75</b> to be rotated by the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the preferred aligning joint <b>22</b> of the present invention comprises a front flange <b>100</b>, configured to seat against the rotor-mounted adapter <b>77</b> and configured for attachment to the output spindle <b>20</b>. The front flange <b>100</b> is operatively coupled to the rear annular member <b>102</b> with a non-rotating connection. The connection between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> is configured to permit adjustment of the relative inclination between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b>, using a single adjustment bolt <b>104</b></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An adjustment ring <b>106</b> is located in an annular recess defined by the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> when assembled together. Adjustment ring <b>106</b> is free to rotate with respect to the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b>. The adjustment ring <b>106</b> contains a pair of fixed wedges <b>108</b>, a centering bearing <b>110</b>, and an adjustment wedge <b>112</b>. The fixed wedges <b>108</b> are secured in a permanent position on the adjustment ring <b>106</b> by screws <b>114</b>. The adjustment wedge <b>112</b> is secured loosely to the adjustment ring <b>106</b> by the adjustment bolt <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The bearing <b>110</b> maintains the adjustment ring <b>106</b> centered in the annular recess so that the adjustment ring <b>106</b> is free to rotate. The bearing <b>110</b> is secured in the adjustment ring <b>106</b> by a spring <b>116</b> and a set screw <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">During use the output spindle <b>20</b> is rotated automatically to an adjustment position by the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b>. The adjustment ring <b>106</b> is then rotated by the operator so that the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> is brought into an adjustment position. The adjustment bolt <b>104</b> is rotated to bring a tapered surface <b>120</b> of the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> into contact with the front flange <b>100</b> and rear annular member <b>102</b>. The angle of the tapered surface <b>120</b> of the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> is greater than the angle of tapered surfaces <b>122</b> on each of the fixed wedges <b>108</b>. This allows the fixed wedges <b>108</b> to make full contact with front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> before the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> begins to change the angle of inclination between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b>. This is necessary to provide stability to the adaptor.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After the fixed wedges <b>108</b> seat against the front flange <b>100</b> and rear annular member <b>102</b>, the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> is forced between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> by the adjustment bolt <b>104</b>. The action of the adjustment wedge <b>112</b> being forced between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> results in a change in the angle of inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an alternative embodiment, the adjustment bolt <b>104</b> and adjustment wedge <b>112</b> of the aligning joint <b>22</b> are replaced with a threaded screw or similar adjustment mechanism oriented parallel to the drive axis DA. Movement of the threaded screw parallel to the drive axis DA directly alters the relative inclination between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear flange <b>102</b>, allowing for compensation for the differences between a wheel rotational axis and the drive axis DA of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, i.e. runout compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A method of the present invention for compensating for the differences between a wheel rotational axis and the drive axis DA of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> involves initially coupling the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> to the adapter <b>77</b> mounted to the wheel hub with the aligning joint <b>22</b> placed between the rotor adaptor <b>77</b> and the output spindle <b>23</b> as described in above. The adjustment ring <b>104</b> is initially free to rotate about the drive axis DA relative to the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear flange <b>102</b>, and the single adjustment bolt <b>106</b> loosened to permit retraction of the adjustment wedge <b>108</b> from contact with the front flange <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">After the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> is attached to the vehicle, the operator levels an inclinometer <b>62</b> within the electronic enclosure <b>24</b> using an adjustment knob <b>120</b> to ensure that it is within an operating range. This is done by adjusting the position of the inclinometer <b>62</b> until the microprocessor <b>40</b> illuminates a level indicator <b>34</b>F, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or another suitable indicator is provided to the operator. Preferably, prior to beginning the compensation procedure, the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> is actuated to rotate the output spindle <b>20</b> through several complete rotations to &#x201c;seat&#x201d; all of the components and to eliminate any binding or stress associated with the attachment of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">To initiate the compensation procedure, the operator actuates an appropriate control <b>34</b>D, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The microprocessor <b>40</b> directs the variable speed variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> to operate at a slow speed to sequentially rotate the output spindle <b>20</b>, and thereby the aligning joint <b>22</b> and the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>, to three unique rotational positions about the drive axis DA, stopping at each position to permit a steady-state runout measurement to be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preferably, each of the three unique rotational positions is separated by approximately 120 degrees of rotation, and to reach each unique rotational position, the output spindle <b>20</b> is rotated through at least one complete revolution about the axis DA. At each rotational position, the rotation is stopped, and a stationary or steady-state angular measurement representative of runout is obtained by the inclinometer <b>62</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any of a variety of measurements which are representative of runout may be obtained at each rotational position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Each steady-state angular measurement is associated with an identified rotational position, as indicted by the motor shaft encoder <b>50</b> operatively coupled to the output spindle <b>20</b>. From the three angular measurements and associated rotational positions, a sinusoidal representation of runout at any rotational position about the drive axis DA is calculated by the microprocessor <b>40</b>, and a single adjustment rotational position for adaptor <b>22</b> is identified.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Methods and procedures for calculation of a sinusoidal representation of runout are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,111 to Carter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,395 to Brauer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,915 to Lill et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,138,825 to Pelta, each herein incorporated by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a variety of methods for measurement of lateral runout, requiring a different number of angular, or distance, measurements at a variety of different rotational positions, may be employed with the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> of the present invention to facilitate lateral runout compensation adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Once the sinusoidal representation of runout has been determined by the microprocessor <b>40</b>, the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> is actuated at the direction of the microprocessor <b>40</b> to rotate the output spindle <b>20</b>, and thereby the aligning joint <b>22</b> and the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>, about the drive axis DA, until the identified single adjustment rotational position is aligned with a predetermined alignment position, preferably top dead center of the spindle rotation axis DA. With the adjustment ring <b>104</b> rotated to the predetermined alignment position, preferably a top-dead-center position, the adjustment bolt <b>106</b> is tightened by the operator, driving the adjustment wedge <b>108</b> into contact with the front flange <b>100</b> and rear annular member <b>102</b>. The contact with the adjustment wedge <b>108</b> alters the relative inclination between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b>, aligning the drive axis DA with the wheel rotational axis.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, a visual or audible indicator is utilized to provide the operator with an indication of when the relative inclination between the front flange <b>100</b> and the rear annular member <b>102</b> has been sufficiently adjusted, as measured by the inclinometer <b>62</b>, to reduce runout to within a predetermined tolerance. For example, the operator may be instructed to turn the adjustment bolt <b>106</b> until a runout display <b>34</b>G, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> turns from red to green.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if it is desired to verify the accuracy of the compensation the operator may press a control button <b>34</b>E, or similar input. Under control of the microprocessor <b>40</b>, the variable speed spindle motor <b>16</b> slowly rotates the output spindle through an arc of approximately 120 degrees. The angular change between the resulting position and the previous compensation position is compared by the microprocessor <b>40</b>. If the angular change is below a predetermined threshold, preferably an angular change equivalent to 0.002 inches of runout, the runout display <b>34</b>G will remain green. If the angle change exceeds the threshold, the runout indicator <b>34</b>G will turn red and it will be necessary for the operator to make additional runout compensation adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an alternative prior art aligning joint <b>22</b> which may be utilized with the present invention comprises a front flange <b>150</b>, configured to seat against the rotor-mounted adapter <b>77</b> and configured for attachment to the output spindle <b>20</b>. The front flange <b>150</b> is operatively coupled to the rear annular member <b>152</b> with a rotating connection. The connection between the front flange <b>150</b> and the rear annular member <b>152</b> is configured to permit adjustment of the relative inclination between the front flange <b>150</b> and the rear annular member <b>152</b>, using a single adjustment bolt <b>154</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The adjustment bolt <b>154</b> is configured to seat within a bore <b>156</b> disposed in a resected portion <b>158</b> of the rear annular member <b>152</b>, perpendicular to the drive axis DA. The bore <b>156</b> passes through the rear annular member <b>152</b>, intersecting an adjustment chamber <b>160</b>. The adjustment chamber <b>160</b> defines an opening in the front face <b>162</b> of the rear annular member <b>152</b>, within which is seated an adjustment wedge <b>164</b>. The adjustment wedge <b>164</b> is a rectangular block, seated within the adjustment chamber <b>160</b>, having an adjustment surface <b>166</b> disposed adjacent the rear face <b>168</b> of the front flange <b>150</b>, and an inclined longitudinal channel <b>170</b> on an opposite face. The inclined longitudinal channel <b>170</b> abuts a tapered portion <b>172</b> of the adjustment bolt <b>154</b> passing through the adjustment chamber <b>160</b>. Axial movement of the adjustment bolt <b>154</b> within the bore <b>156</b> results in a sliding contact between the tapered portion <b>172</b> and the inclined longitudinal channel <b>170</b> of the adjustment wedge <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The adjustment wedge <b>164</b> is restrained against movement perpendicular to the drive axis DA by the interior surface of the adjustment chamber <b>160</b>.

The direction of movement is dependant upon the direction of the sliding contact. The resulting movement of the adjustment wedge <b>164</b> operates to alter the relative inclination between the front flange <b>150</b> and the rear flange <b>152</b>, responsive to the adjustment of the single adjustment bolt <b>154</b>, providing runout compensation in substantially the same manner of operation as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">During operation of an alternate embodiment of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, a cutting tip contact indicator circuit, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, provides an operator with a visual indication of contact between each cutting tip <b>201</b> and a surface <b>202</b> of a brake rotor <b>204</b>. While described below in the context of an on-car brake lathe <b>10</b>, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the cutting tip contact indicator circuit described herein may be readily adapted and utilized for use with a bench brake lathe, such as shown at <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and hence such an embodiment is considered within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Each cutting tip <b>201</b> is electrically coupled, to a power source <b>206</b>, such as a battery, to an associated indicator circuit <b>208</b>, and to an electrical ground <b>210</b>. Contact between a cutting tip <b>201</b> and the brake rotor surface <b>202</b> completes an electrical circuit between the electrical ground <b>210</b> and the power source <b>206</b>, resulting in an electrical current flow through an associated indicator circuit <b>208</b>. Preferably, the associated indicator circuit <b>208</b> incorporates one or more LEDs <b>212</b>, which are correspondingly illuminated by the flow of electrical current to provide the operator with a visual confirmation of contact between the cutting tip <b>201</b> and the brake rotor surface <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For some applications, it is desirable to provide an operator with a visual indication of a depth of cut for the cutting tips. In an alternate embodiment on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> of the present a visual indication is provided in the form of a numerical depth-of-cut display, but may take the form of a bar graph or other suitable visual measurement indication. Information provided to the operator on the depth-of-cut display is based on signals received at the microprocessor <b>40</b> from a rotary encoder <b>300</b> operatively coupled to the cutting head <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The rotary encoder <b>300</b> is disposed at an end of a threaded shaft <b>302</b> upon which the individual cutting tip holders <b>19</b> are disposed. Rotation of the threaded shaft <b>302</b> in a first direction moves each cutting tip holder <b>19</b> in a first direction, i.e., towards each other. Correspondingly, rotation of the threaded shaft <b>302</b> in the opposite direction moves each cutting tip holder <b>19</b> in the opposite direction, i.e. apart from each other. Each individual cutting tip holder <b>19</b> may be selectively locked in place relative to the threaded shaft <b>302</b> by a conventional locking mechanism <b>304</b>, such that only one cutting tip holder <b>19</b> moves at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">To measure a depth-of-cut for a single cutting tip holder <b>19</b>, the cutting tip <b>21</b> of a cutting tip holder <b>19</b> is initially moved into contact with the surface of a brake rotor <b>75</b>. Upon contact, the signal from the rotary encoder <b>300</b> is either &#x201c;zeroed&#x201d; or recorded by the microprocessor <b>40</b>. Subsequent movement of the cutting tip holder <b>19</b>, as tracked by the signals from the rotary encoder <b>300</b>, is displayed to the operator on a depth-of-cut display, and corresponds to a measured displacement from the previously &#x201c;zeroed&#x201d; or recorded position. The indication of initial contact between the cutting tip <b>21</b> and the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b> may be either manually provided by an operator or automatically detected with a contact sensor signal as previously described. Once the desired depth-of-cut for the selected cutting tip holder <b>19</b> is reached, the cutting tip holder <b>19</b> is locked in place with the locking mechanism <b>304</b>, and the process repeated for the second cutting tip holder <b>19</b> relative to the opposite face of the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>. The ability to predict the final thickness of a rotor after the selection of a desired depth of cut permits an operator to determine of the resulting final thickness will be less than a recommended minimum thickness, and to determine if the rotor should be replaced rather than resurfaced.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The cutting tip holder movement signal from the rotary encoder <b>300</b> may be further utilized by the microprocessor <b>40</b> to provide a thickness or displacement measurement between the two cutting tip holders <b>19</b> of the cutting head <b>18</b>. To provide a displacement measurement, a calibration block of a predetermined thickness, such as 1.000 inches, is placed between the two cutting tip holders <b>19</b>. The two cutting tip holders <b>19</b> are then moved to contact the associated cutting tips <b>21</b> with opposite sides of the calibration block. The operator then indicates that the cutting tip holders <b>19</b> are in a calibration displacement, and the microprocessor <b>40</b> associates the current signal from the rotary encoder <b>300</b> to the predetermined size of the calibration block. Subsequent movement of the cutting tip holders <b>19</b>, either relatively towards or away from each other, is registered by the rotary encoder <b>300</b>, and used to calculate a current displacement distance between each of the cutting tip holders <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The displayed value of depth of cut may also be used by the operator to predict the final thickness of a vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b> after selection of a desired depth-of-cut, or to measure the amount of runout present in each face of the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>. Vehicle brake rotor face runout is independent of the runout present between the mounting of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> and the wheel hub. A cutting tip <b>21</b> is brought into initial contact with the highest point on a vehicle brake rotor face, i.e. the point on having the greatest measure of lateral runout in an outward direction. At this point, the signal from the rotary encoder <b>300</b> may be associated with the peak runout, or &#x201c;zeroed&#x201d; by the microprocessor <b>40</b> Subsequent movement of the cutting tip <b>21</b> to the lowest point on the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>, i.e. the point on the face having the least measure of lateral runout in an outward direction, and comparison of the signal from the rotary encoder <b>300</b> with the previously associated signal, provides an indication of runout present in that face of the vehicle brake rotor <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">For some vehicle brake lathe applications, it is desirable for the brake lathe <b>10</b> to communicate with one or more remote vehicle service systems or computers. In an alternate embodiment, the microprocessor <b>40</b> of the on-car brake lathe <b>10</b> is operatively coupled to a communication circuit <b>56</b>, such as an serial communications link, for exchanging information with a remote computer system, or one or more automotive service devices, such as a vehicle wheel aligner or a vehicle wheel balancer (not shown).
