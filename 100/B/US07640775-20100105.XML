<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A sheet of material formed for folding into a three-dimensional structure. The sheet has edges formed with joinder structures, such as dovetails, and a plurality of folding structures, such as slits, grooves or displacements, that control folding of the sheet in a manner causing the joinder structures to be folded into interlocking interengagement. The folding structures are configured for very precise folding of the sheet so that the folding structures will be in precise registered juxtaposition. Additionally, the sheet of material includes a retention structure, such as a retention fold or a retention deformation, which will prevent unfolding of the sheet. A method for fastener-free joining of sheet edges together also is disclosed, as are the resulting three-dimensional structures.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates, in general, to apparatus and methods for joining together the edges of sheet material which has been folded so as to form three-dimensional structures, and more particularly, relates to apparatus and methods for joining sheet material which has been folded using high-precision folding structures capable of accurately registering joinder structures for coupling together of sheet edges.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Related Applications set forth above, and incorporated herein by reference, set forth in considerable detail apparatus and methods for bending or folding sheet material to form three-dimensional structures. Flat sheets are provided with a plurality of folding structures which will produce folding of the sheets along fold lines that can very precisely be controlled. The folding structures are typically slits, grooves or displacements that are positioned on alternating sides of a desired fold line so as to define spaced-apart bending or folding straps that precisely control folding of the sheet. Most preferably, the folding structures also produce edge-to-face engagement of the sheet material on opposite sides of the folding structures to further enhance folding precision and structural strength.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The folded sheets of the Related Applications often have been used to produce three-dimensional structures in which free or adjacent edges of the sheets are folded into abutting or overlapping relation and then are joined together to stabilize the resulting structure against unfolding. The previous techniques for securing the edges of the folded sheets together have varied considerably, depending upon the application, but in many instances the sheet edges have merely been joined together using standard fasteners such as screws, rivets, other mechanical fasteners, and/or welding, brazing or adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the very substantial advantages of the apparatus and method of the Related Applications is the ability to fold sheet material with both great precision and complexity using low folding forces. Precise and complex folding of sheet material allows techniques for joining the edges of the sheet material to be based upon precise registration of the edges at the end of the folding process so that joinder structures provided at, or proximate to the edges can be folded into registration with each other for the purpose of coupling the joinder structure together against separation of the edges.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The complexity with which sheets can be folded using the techniques set forth in the Related Applications allows a great reduction in the number of separate parts required to create a structure. Further reducing the number of parts by eliminating separate mechanical fasteners, therefore, is highly desirable, and elimination of separate welding, soldering and adhesive bonding steps also reduces the cost associated with the finished part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the precise sheet folding systems of the Related Applications can be applied to a wide range of sheet thicknesses. Thus, fastener-free sheet edge joining should also be capable of being used in applications requiring high strength joinder of the sheet edges.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is an apparatus and method to employ the ability to precisely fold sheet material in a manner which will allow fastener-free, high strength, low cost joinder of edges of the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed is an apparatus and method to provide an apparatus and method for forming enclosures or housings for various purposes, including the enclosure of electrical components, which apparatus and method lend themselves to efficient and low-cost manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The apparatus and method of the present invention have other objects and features of advantage which will become apparent from, or are set forth in more detail in, the accompanying drawing and Detailed Description Of The Invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present invention includes a sheet of material formed for bending or folding into a three-dimensional structure which includes, briefly, a sheet having edges and joinder structures proximate the edges formed to join the edges together; a plurality of shape-controlling folding structures formed in the sheet of material along a plurality of desired fold lines, the folding structures being positioned to enable folding of the sheet of material into a three-dimensional structure of a desired shape and the shape-controlling folding structures being configured to cause the joinder structures proximate the sheet edges to be positioned together in registration for joining when the sheet material is folded; and the sheet material being further formed with at least one retention structure formed to retain the joinder structures and edges together.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Most preferably, the joinder structures are provided by shaping the edges of the sheet with mating configurations, such as dovetails, which can be interlocked together against separation by the retention structure. In one embodiment, the retention structure is provided by a plurality of retention folding slits, grooves or displacements that are positioned to produce folding of the sheet material out of the plane of the joinder structures. In an alternate embodiment, the retention structure is provided by a resiliently displaceable deformation or bend which biases the joinder structures together against separation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the invention, the three-dimensional object or structure formed from a sheet of material having shape-controlling folding structures, edge joining structures and retention structures is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of fastening edges of a sheet of material together to form a three-dimensional structure is also provided and includes, briefly, the steps of: folding the sheet of material along a plurality of shape-controlling fold lines, the fold lines being controlled by a plurality of shape-controlling structures provided in the sheet of material which are adapted to cause sufficiently precise folding along the fold lines that two edges of the sheet of material are positioned in precise registered juxtaposition for fastening together; and the step of fastening the juxtaposed edges together to prevent unfolding of the three-dimensional structure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect, a method of assembling a plurality of components into a plurality of folded enclosures also is provided which includes the steps of: forming a sheet of material with a plurality of enclosure blanks attached in side-by-side relation to the sheet of material, with each enclosure blank having a plurality of shape-controlling folding structures formed therein and having a plurality of joinder structures formed in at least two edges of the blank. The folding structures are positioned to enable folding of the enclosure blanks into a three-dimensional enclosures with the joinder structures on the two edges being positioned together in registered relation for coupling together. The enclosure blanks also each further include a retention structures to hold the joinder structures in place against separation. The method further includes the steps of: folding each enclosure blank up out of the plane of the sheet, while still attached to the sheet of material to produce a partially formed enclosure blank; mounting a component into each of the partially formed enclosure blanks; thereafter folding the enclosure blank further while attached to the sheet of material to encircle a portion of the component and to position the joinder structures of the enclosure blank in registration for coupling together; coupling the joinder structures together; securing the joinder structures using the retention structures; and detaching the enclosures with the components therein from the sheet of material.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in connection with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus and method of the present invention for joining together edges of sheet material which has been folded into a three-dimensional object or structure can be employed in a wide range of applications. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, a business card holder is illustrated because it is a good example of the complexity of precise folding which is achievable using the apparatus and methods of the Related Applications. This precision and capacity for complexity lends itself particularly well to new solutions for joining the edges of the folded sheets together, either with or without fasteners. The cardholder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> is not designed to withstand substantial loading forces, as would be, for example, a box beam, but cardholders constructed as shown in the present drawings have been made out of folded stainless steel sheet material having a thickness dimension of 0.046 inches. The same edge joining structures and processes employed for the described cardholder are equally as applicable to load bearing three-dimensional structures and to sheet material of greater or lesser thickness, as well as to joining the edges of other metal and non-metallic sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a business card holder, generally designated <b>21</b>, is shown which has been folded from a piece of flat sheet material and is ready for use. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of business cards <b>22</b> are held by cardholder <b>21</b>, as it would normally be used. Cardholder <b>21</b> has been folded from a flat sheet of material or cardholder blank <b>23</b>, in this case a stainless steel blank, which sheet is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Once folded up into the three-dimensional structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the sheet has been secured along edges, as will be described in more detail hereinafter, against unfolding.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Sheet <b>23</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as it would be typically formed out of a much larger sheet, for example, by laser cutting, water jet cutting, punching, stamping and/or other suitable means. Typically, a plurality of cardholder sheets <b>23</b> are laid out in relatively nested relation to minimize scrap and then are cut from the larger sheet, for example, by a CNC controlled laser cutter. Cardholder <b>21</b> is then formed by folding cardholder blank <b>23</b>, as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> a generally U-shaped cardholder blank <b>23</b> is shown which has free edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> that have been formed with joinder structures <b>28</b>, in this case dovetail configurations. One will appreciate that other joinder structures may also be employed. Joinder structures <b>28</b> are formed in a manner which will allow the spaced-apart free edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> to eventually be joined together into the three-dimensional object of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Cardholder blank <b>23</b> has edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> which are to be joined and are spaced apart from each other when the sheet material is in the flat condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The edge joining techniques of the present invention also can be used, however, to join edges which are contiguous or abutting relation when sheet <b>23</b> is in the flat condition, for example, edges oriented at 90 degrees to each other and touching at an apex. Such edge configurations often are employed in corner structures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, cardholder <b>21</b> is a form of enclosure or continuous peripheral wall in which one edge <b>26</b> of the blank is folded around to produce a continuous wall which is joined to the other edge <b>27</b>. The three-dimensioned structure produced and joined into a stable structure by the edge joining apparatus and method of the present invention does not have to be an enclosure or to have a continuous wall which encircles a central space, but such structures are particularly advantageously formed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The flat sheet or cardholder blank <b>23</b> also includes a plurality of shaped-controlling folding structures <b>29</b> formed in the sheet of material along a plurality of desired fold lines <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c </i>and <b>31</b><i>d </i>which will cause the sheet of material to be folded into a desired three-dimensional shape in which sheet edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> will be positioned in juxtaposed registered relation. This folding process will be described in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Sheet <b>23</b> is further provided with at least one retention structure formed to retain the joinder structures <b>28</b> together against separation. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the retention structures <b>32</b> are in the form of folds or bends along retention fold lines <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>that secure the folded cardholder blank against unfolding.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shape-controlling folding structures <b>29</b> and the retention folding structures <b>32</b> are both preferably constructed in the same manner. These folding structures are provided as described in the Related Applications, and they are formed in a manner which will result in very precise folding of sheet material <b>23</b> along the desired fold lines. These folding structures can take the form of slits, grooves or displacements formed in cardholder blank <b>23</b>, and they define folding straps <b>34</b> between longitudinally adjacent fold inducing structures <b>29</b> and <b>32</b>. Folding straps <b>34</b> between the slits, grooves or displacements have center lines which extend obliquely across folding lines <b>31</b><i>a</i>-<b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>b </i>so as to precisely control folding of sheet blanks <b>23</b>. In the most preferred form, the folding structures are formed with a kerf or width dimension that ensures that the sheet material on opposite sides of folding structures <b>29</b> and <b>32</b> will engage in edge-to-face engagement during folding for greater precision of folding, when combined with the precision achieved by using oblique folding straps <b>34</b>. The principles which control precise sheet material folding are set forth in more detail, for example, in application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/256,870, identified more fully in the Related Application section of this application.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-9</figref>, folding of cardholder blank <b>23</b> into the three-dimensional cardholder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> can be described in more detail. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, cardholder blank or sheet <b>23</b> has been folded along fold lines <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>upwardly from the plane of the sheet in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, with their joinder structures <b>28</b>, are now in a near vertical orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one side of blank <b>23</b> has been folded along fold line <b>31</b><i>d </i>to a near parallel orientation to the front panel <b>35</b>, which bears an &#x201c;IOI&#x201d; standing for &#x201c;Industrial Origami, Inc.&#x201d; The fold along fold line <b>31</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, therefore, starts to complete the enclosure which will result in edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> being juxtaposed, but edge <b>27</b> will be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> not to be in position for joinder to edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a fold along fold line <b>31</b><i>c </i>has been made so as to position edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the sheet in juxtaposed and registered relation with dovetail joinder structures <b>28</b> interengaged with each other so as to join what was the free edges of the sheet or blank <b>23</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once back panel portions <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>have been folded together, they will be aligned in substantially the same plane, as will joinder dovetails <b>28</b> on edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. Such positioning of the dovetail joinder structures in the same plane allows edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> to be slightly displaced inwardly or outwardly of the common plane and then displaced back into the common plane of panels <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>for interlocking of the dovetails. As long as the dovetails remain in a common plane, they will not be separable, as is well know to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is possible for back panels <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>to be oriented in slightly skewed planes and still stay interlocked, with the amount of skewing which is possible increasing as the thickness of the sheet of material and the dimensional tolerances of the dovetails are increased. In fact, as will be described below, both front panel <b>35</b> and back panels <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>are preferably bowed somewhat, from a common plane, which can be easily accommodated by the thickness of the sheet stock and even moderate differences in the dovetail dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It also should be noted that in the broadest aspect of the present invention, joinder structures <b>28</b> do not have to be formed for joining in substantially two dimensions, as are dovetails. Corner joinder structures can be provided, for example, in which the edge joinder structures prevent separation of the edges when folded together to produce a corner. A sheet retention structure must also be appropriately formed to prevent separation of the corner joinder structures from one another. Retention of the dovetails against separation is described below for joinder structures <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One advantage of the edge joinder method of the present invention is that the edges do not have to be overlapped, that is, the ends or edges of the sheet material are joined in end-to-end relation with the joined wall having the same thickness across the joined edges. For example, the edges of the sheet material lay &#x201c;in-plane&#x201d; with respect to one another and are not overlapped, that is, the edges do not lie one upon the other. This has both aesthetic and structural advantages for certain objects, such as, business card holders.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Edge joinder structures <b>28</b> are shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> as being substantially continuously extending along edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. It will be understood, however, that a single joinder structure <b>28</b> might be usable for joining edges in some structures, or intermittent, spaced-apart joinder structures <b>28</b> could be employed. For many structures, a continuous joint between edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> has strength, as well as aesthetic advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At this point it also should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> do not show the thickness dimension of sheet or blank <b>23</b>, and to that extent the drawings are schematic. In fact, sheet <b>23</b> will have a thickness dimension and when dovetail joinder structures <b>28</b> are interengaged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the thickness dimension of the sheet will prevent separation of both the dovetails and free edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, as above described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is essentially an enclosure which could be part of a rectangular box beam, a tapered box beam or the like, could be subjected to shifting of edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> out of the substantially common plane <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, with the result of possible disengagement of dovetail joinder structures <b>28</b>. Folding structures <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> have an advantage, in addition to precision of their folding, of being able to fold under relatively low folding forces. Thus, a stainless steel sheet can be folded along fold lines <b>31</b><i>a</i>-<b>31</b><i>d </i>by hand. Juxtaposed free edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, therefore, also could become unfolded or even unfolded back to a flat sheet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus, it is preferable that at least one retention structure be provided on blank <b>32</b> to essentially interlock dovetails <b>28</b> against disengagement. In the broadest sense that could be a panel (not shown) that folds across the joinder dovetails and is secured by a standard fastener such as a screw or rivet. This would increase the number of parts required for the cardholder, as well as creating an overlapping of walls.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, two retention fold lines <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>are used to interlock dovetails <b>28</b> against separation. As will be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, therefore, sheet flaps <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> have been folded down along fold line <b>33</b><i>a </i>to a position proximate front panel <b>35</b> bearing logo <b>41</b>. In addition, blank flaps <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, which also are held together by dovetails <b>28</b>, have been folded down about retention fold line <b>33</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The retention folds, therefore, cause flaps <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> to be out of the common plane <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the back of the cardholder, and they thereby interlock the dovetails together against separation by virtue of flaps <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> limiting out-of-plane motion of common plane portions <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The retention fold lines <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>result in folds which are extremely difficult for even the relatively easily folded sheet material to unfold back thereby reducing the possibility that the dovetails will become disengaged.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to further enhance the interlocking of dovetail joinder structures <b>28</b>, however, a keeper assembly further can be provided in cardholder blank <b>23</b> which is adapted to resist unfolding of the sheet material along the retention fold lines. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the keeper assembly is comprised of a tab and a mating slot. In this case the tab takes the form of a first tab <b>61</b><i>a </i>on panel <b>51</b> and a second tab <b>61</b><i>b </i>on panel <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that are dimensioned to be inserted into a slot <b>62</b> in front panel <b>35</b> of sheet <b>23</b>. The insertion of tabs <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>into slot <b>62</b> can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thus, the slot and tab keeper assembly prevents panels <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> from unfolding along retention fold line <b>33</b><i>a</i>. Most preferably the length dimension between fold line <b>33</b><i>a </i>and tabs <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>b </i>is selected to cause a slight bowing out of front panel <b>35</b> and back panels <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>during the insertion process. This bowing causes a resilient springing back of the front and back panels toward each other, thereby preventing the tabs <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>b </i>from being easily able to escape from slot <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, panels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> have not been folded completely down about retention fold line <b>33</b><i>b </i>to the final condition as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Such folding can proceed until the panels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are at a slight angle to the back of the cardholder so as to support the cards <b>22</b> in a slightly tilted back condition. This makes it easier to remove the cards from the cardholder, and the panels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> perform the double function of retaining the free edges of the sheet interlocked by joinder structures <b>28</b> and structurally supporting cards <b>22</b> when positioned in the cardholder.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that the fold along retention fold line <b>33</b><i>b </i>is one in which the sheet is almost folded back on itself. This can be readily done using the technology of the Related Applications and it makes unfolding of the structure even more difficult, which is, of course, the purpose of the retention structures.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, joinder structures on the edges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are provided by dovetails. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, free edges <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>a </i>are joined by L-shaped joinder structures <b>28</b><i>a</i>. It will be understood, therefore that various other types of interlocking joinder structures are contemplated for use in the present invention. The high precision with which such joinder structures can be folded during relatively complex folding of sheet <b>23</b>, with fold lines at various angles to achieve the desired shape, makes it possible for very precise registration of the free edges of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, another retention structure which is capable of retaining mated joinder structures together against separation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a plurality of side-by-side enclosure or housing blanks <b>124</b> are formed in strip material <b>123</b>. The enclosures are formed to receive a component or components, such as, electrical components <b>125</b><i>a </i>and <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and in the illustrated process, components <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b </i>are mounted one after another into the side-by-side enclosure blanks <b>124</b> formed in strip <b>123</b>. The enclosure blanks are further formed for folding after the components are positioned in the blank to complete the enclosure. Edge-joining joinder structures <b>128</b> are provided in blanks <b>124</b>, and the joinder structures are held in interlocked relation by an alternative embodiment of a retention structure. The sequence illustrated is a staged mounting of components to the side-by-side housing blanks and thereafter completion of the component enclosures and removal of the same from the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in more detail, therefore, a strip <b>123</b> is provided in which a plurality of side-by-side enclosure blanks <b>124</b> have been formed, for example, by laser cutting, water jet cutting, stamping, punching, and/or other suitable means. Initially, the blanks <b>124</b> would be in a flat condition or all in the same plane. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, edges <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> of the blanks have been tilted up by about 90 degrees from the plane of sheet <b>123</b>, and these edges will be seen to be formed with joinder structures <b>128</b>, which are again illustrated as dovetails. The sheet is schematically illustrated in that it does not include a width dimension for ease of understanding. The upstanding sides <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> of blanks <b>124</b> are positioned for receipt of component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b</i>. A first component portion <b>125</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the partially formed enclosure blanks <b>124</b> at station <b>135</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, a second component portion <b>125</b><i>b </i>can be mounted on the end of component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, while the component blank side walls <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> are in a near vertical orientation, at station <b>140</b>. At station <b>145</b>, side walls <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> are folded to begin to enclose component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and at station <b>150</b> the enclosure is completed and dovetails <b>128</b> shown in interlocked interengagement. At station <b>155</b>, the enclosed component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b </i>has been removed from sheet <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Again, there is a possible issue of unfolding of the enclosure blank from around component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, retention of interlocking of dovetails <b>128</b> has been accomplished in a different manner than for the dovetails <b>28</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> schematically illustrates the manner of retaining joinder structures <b>128</b> together that has been employed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. As will be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the upstanding side walls <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> essentially form an L-shaped end cross section with walls <b>139</b> and <b>141</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The retention structure employed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> is a deformation which is here shown as L-shaped corners or bends <b>161</b> between enclosure blank walls <b>129</b> and <b>139</b> and between walls <b>131</b> and <b>141</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Corners <b>161</b> are formed using conventional metal bending techniques; they are not folded or bent using the technology of the Related Applications. Thus, at a station or stage <b>130</b>, L-shaped bends <b>161</b> are formed by a combination of conventional bending dies that will require substantial force to be applied to form bends or corners <b>161</b>. The result is a bend or corner <b>161</b> which will hold its shape against unbending. Enclosure side wall <b>131</b> is joined to side wall <b>141</b> by a corner that resiliently couples the two side walls together. Small arcuate displacements of side wall <b>131</b> relative to side wall <b>141</b>, therefore, will be resisted by bend <b>161</b>, and when the displacing force is removed, the side walls will return to the relative angular relationship produced by deforming them to station or stage <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The folds or corners <b>162</b> between enclosure blank side walls <b>139</b> and enclosure blank back wall <b>163</b>, and between enclosure blank side wall <b>141</b> and back wall <b>163</b> are made using the technology of the Related Applications. Folds <b>162</b>, therefore, are much more easily made, and they tend to resiliently spring back or have memory to a much lesser degree than bends <b>161</b>. Standard or conventional metal bending becomes very difficult as shapes become complex, so it is preferable to minimize the use of reliant folds, such as corners <b>161</b>, and use folds, such as folds <b>162</b>, for as many of the enclosure forming folds as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b </i>is mounted to the enclosure blank at stations <b>135</b>, <b>140</b>, folds <b>162</b> can be bent into the closed condition shown at stations <b>145</b> and <b>150</b>. The result will be that dovetails <b>128</b> will be interlocked, and the conventional bends or deformations of the enclosure blank at folds <b>161</b> will act as resilient springs or retention structures that resist unfolding of blanks <b>124</b>. The angle to which conventional corners or folds <b>161</b> are bent can be slightly less than 90 degrees so that a resilient downward biasing of sides <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> toward component <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b </i>is maintained. This will cooperate with folding of the sides <b>129</b>, <b>131</b> into abutting relation against the enclosed electronic component to keep the dovetail joinder structures from opening up or becoming separated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As will be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11 and 12</figref>, a process for assembly of components into a plurality of enclosures also can be implemented by using the edge joining techniques described above. Moreover, this process allows components to be enclosed using a single sheet of material and without using separate fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A sheet or strip of sheet material <b>123</b> is formed with a plurality of side-by-side enclosure blanks <b>124</b>. These blanks are preferably attached to a common sheet or strip <b>123</b> which can be moved through a plurality of assembly stages, <b>130</b>, <b>135</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>. The enclosure blank as formed with a plurality of shape-controlling folding structures, such as slits, grooves or displacements, and side edges <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> of the enclosure blank, are formed with joinder structures therein, such as dovetails <b>128</b>. A retention structure, such as a deformation or conventionally formed fold <b>161</b> is formed in blanks <b>124</b> at an early assembly station or stage, such as stage <b>130</b>, to provide a corner or bend that will resiliently return to its bent shape to provide a biasing structure. The process also includes the steps of folding the enclosure blank <b>124</b> to produce a partially formed enclosure blank; mounting a component or components in the partially formed enclosure blank; thereafter folding the blank to complete the enclosure and position the dovetail joinder structures in interengagement; and retaining or securing the joinder against separation by, for example, a resilient biasing corner, bend or deformation.</p>
