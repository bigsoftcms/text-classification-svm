<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to a lightweight and durable dock and/or pier having a twin-fin float system and components formed of pultruded materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is well-known that docks are man-made structures that extend from shore over a body of water. Docks are commonly employed to provide a walkway from the shore to a boat, which may be tethered to a post or piling adjacent the dock. In addition, docks may be used as a location to swim from, as well as a spot to relax and enjoy the nautical scenery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is common for water levels to fluctuate. For instance, the ocean tides cause the water levels to vary along an ocean coastline, and the release or retaining of water within a reservoir may also alter the reservoir's water level. Consequently, it may be desirable for docks to accommodate changes in the water level. One way docks commonly account for the changing water levels is to connect the dock to a float system. In this manner, as the water levels fluctuate, the dock remains floating on the surface of the water. A gangway may extend from the shore to the floating portion of the dock to provide a pathway thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many existing floating docks are constructed using a wood frame. The wood frame may be connected to an upper walking surface fabricated from a wood, concrete, or plastic material. Although wood is a commonly used construction material, it is very heavy compared to the weight of modern composite material. Thus, it may be problematic in relation to a floating dock. In particular, the wood may splinter, which may cause harm to anyone walking over the dock in their bare feet, which tends to occur when someone is swimming off of the dock. Furthermore, the screws or nails holding the wood together may protrude through the wood, thereby creating a safety hazard. The screws or nails may also fall out of the wood, which tends to weaken the structural integrity of the dock. In addition, the wood is liable to further structural weakening caused by termite infestation or rotting of the wood.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional drawback with most wood-framed docks is that they are typically custom-built for the specific user. In this manner, a considerable amount of time is spent designing and constructing the dock, which usually increases the cost thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another common material employed to construct floating docks is concrete. Although concrete is a regularly used construction material, there may be some drawbacks to using it to construct a floating dock, especially when the dock is used over a body of water having fluctuating water levels (i.e. ocean or reservoir). During low tide, portions of the concrete dock may come in contact with the shore, while other portions may remain floating. Consequently, the dock may be placed under stress, which may cause cracking in the concrete. If the concrete cracks, salt water may seep into the dock and weaken the structural integrity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Floating docks are also readily formed of a metallic material, particularly in freshwater conditions. Metallic floating docks are undesirable in saltwater because of corrosion problems. However, even in freshwater, metal docks may bend when the level of the water decreases to the point that the portions of the dock are resting on the shore, while other portions remain floating (as may be the case in a reservoir). Although the metal may have a certain amount of elasticity enabling the dock to reflex to a relatively straight configuration, if the dock bends beyond a certain point, the bend in the dock may be permanent.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Regardless of the material used to construct the floating dock, after construction, the floating dock is deployed in the body of water. The floating dock is typically restrained from movement to prevent the dock from floating away. A regularly used restraining technique is to design the dock to include a hole for allowing a piling to protrude therethrough. The pilings typically restrain the dock from floating away.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In rough conditions, waves may cause the dock to rise and fall along the pilings. Therefore, floating docks commonly include one or more rigid rollers to facilitate upward and downward movement of the dock relative to the piling. However, there is generally a small amount of clearance between the roller and the piling. Therefore, under rough conditions, the rollers may crash with the pilings, which typically results in banging and instability of the dock. Furthermore, the float systems connected to the docks are typically designed with the intention of simply keeping the dock floating, as opposed to enhancing the stability of the dock.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As is apparent from the foregoing, there exists a need in the art for an improved dock configuration. The present invention addresses this particular need, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is provided a dock having a pair of primary frame members and a pair of secondary frame members. The primary and secondary frame members are formed of a fiber-reinforced resin material. The primary frame members extend parallel to a primary axis and are arranged in opposed, spaced parallel relation to each other. Likewise, the secondary frame members extend parallel to a secondary axis and are arranged in opposed, spaced parallel relation to each other. Each secondary frame member is connected to the pair of primary frame members. The dock also includes a plurality of cross members. Each cross member is connected to and extends between the pair of primary frame members. Each cross member includes an upper platform contact face disposed within a common upper platform contact plane.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The primary and secondary frame members may be formed by a pultrusion process, which tends to produce frame members that are lightweight and durable. The pultrusion formed frame members are unlikely to splinter or crack like convention wood dock frames. In addition, the pultrusion formed frame members may be formed in standard sizes to facilitate assembly of the dock.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The dock may also include a plurality of joint supports. Each joint support may include a primary joint face connected to one of the primary frame members and a secondary joint face connected to one of the secondary frame members. An adhesive may be disposed between each joint support and the respective primary and secondary frame members. Each joint support may include a plurality of joint holes disposed within the primary and secondary joint faces. A sufficient amount of adhesive may be disposed between each joint support to cause the adhesive to flow through and be disposed within at least one of the plurality of joint holes. Each joint support may also include a joint platform contact face disposed within a common upper platform contact plane.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The dock may also include an upper platform formed of a fiber-reinforced resin material. The upper platform may be formed by a pultrusion process. The upper platform may include an upper walking portion and a lower contact surface disposed in contact with each upper platform contact face. The upper platform may be connected to each upper platform contact face via double backed adhesive tape, or other composite adhesives or mechanical fasteners. The upper platform may include a plurality of inter-connected upper platform elements. The upper platform elements may form a monocoque support structure having enhanced strength and rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">There is also provided a float system for use with a dock. The float system includes a floatation shell having opposing shell lateral portions. The floatation shell defines a floatation cavity and is disposable beneath a lower water facing surface of the dock. The floatation shell includes a shell base and a pair of opposing floatation fins. The floatation fins extend away from the shell base to define respective fin distal portions. Each flotation fin is disposed adjacent a respective one of the opposing shell lateral portions. Each fin includes a fin medial face and a fin lateral face defining a fin width therebetween. The fin width decreases from the shell base towards the fin distal portion. The size and configuration of the floatation shell, including the shell base and floatation fins, may be varied to accommodate the floatation characteristics desired in the particular dock system to which it is being used. For instance, the size and configuration of the floatation shell may be varied to achieve a desired freeboard height, or buoyant support for the dock.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The floatation shell may include a pair of floatation elements that collectively define the floatation shell. Each floatation element may include a respective one of the pair of opposing floatation fins. A buoyant element may be disposed within the floatation cavity to increase the buoyancy of the float system. An attachment flange having a plurality of fastener openings may be connected to the floatation shell to enable attachment to the dock.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">There is further provided a roller for use on a dock positioned near a piling. The roller includes a spring biased bracket having a dock contact portion engageable with the dock. The dock contact portion includes a dock contact upper surface. The bracket also includes a bracket sidewall having a sidewall lower edge. The sidewall lower edge and the dock contact upper surface define a bracket angle. The spring biased bracket is moveable between a compressed position and an extended position, wherein the bracket angle increases as the spring biased bracket moves from the compressed position to the extended position. The spring biased bracket is biased towards the extended position. The roller also includes a wheel rotatably connected to the bracket sidewall. The wheel is engageable with the piling.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to the drawings where the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the present invention only, and not for purposes of limiting the same, there is shown a dock <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The dock <b>10</b> includes a pair of primary frame members <b>12</b> extending along a length thereof. According to one implementation, each primary frame member <b>12</b> includes a primary upper flange <b>16</b>, a primary lower flange <b>18</b>, and a primary wall <b>20</b> extending between the primary upper and lower flanges <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the primary upper flange <b>16</b> defines a primary upper edge and the primary lower flange <b>18</b> defines a primary lower edge <b>18</b>. The primary frame members <b>12</b> extend along a primary axis <b>14</b> and are arranged in opposed, spaced parallel relation to each other. In this manner, the primary walls <b>20</b> of the respective primary frame members <b>12</b> may be facing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The dock <b>10</b> also includes a pair of secondary frame members <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the secondary frame members <b>22</b> each include a secondary upper flange <b>26</b>, a secondary lower flange <b>28</b>, and a secondary wall extending therebetween. The secondary upper flange <b>26</b> may define a secondary upper edge and the secondary lower flange <b>28</b> may define a secondary lower edge. The secondary frame members <b>22</b> extend along a secondary axis <b>24</b> and are arranged in opposed, spaced parallel relation to each other. In this regard, the secondary walls of the respective secondary frame members <b>22</b> may be facing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It may be desirable to form the primary frame members <b>12</b> and the secondary frame members <b>22</b> of a pultruded material. As used herein, a pultruded material is a material having one or more reinforcing fibers. Pultruded materials tend to be stronger, durable, and/or more lightweight than conventional dock materials (e.g. wood or metal). In one particular embodiment, the primary frame members <b>12</b> and the secondary frame members <b>22</b> are constructed of a fiber-reinforced resin material formed by a pultrusion process. The fiber-reinforced resin material may include, but is not limited to, fiber-reinforced fiber glass. Although the frame member <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> are formed of pultruded materials in one embodiment, the frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may be formed of extruded materials, or other materials known by those skilled in the art in another embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The primary and/or secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may be connected to a bumper <b>52</b> to mitigate damage caused by contact with a boat positioned adjacent the dock <b>10</b>. The bumper <b>52</b> may be formed of a resilient material, such as rubber, capable of withstanding repeated contact with an adjacent boat.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the secondary frame members <b>22</b> are arranged orthogonally to the primary frame members <b>12</b>. In other words, the secondary axis <b>24</b> is perpendicular to the primary axis <b>14</b>. It is understood that other embodiments may include primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> that are arranged in a non-orthogonal configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The secondary frame members <b>22</b> are connected to the primary frame members <b>12</b>. More specifically, each secondary frame member <b>22</b> is connected to both primary frame members <b>12</b>. Likewise, each primary frame member <b>12</b> is connected to both secondary frame members <b>22</b>. The primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may be connected to each other in abutting or non-abutting configurations. In other words, the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may be directly connected to each other, or an intermediate connection element may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to one embodiment, the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> are connected via joint supports <b>38</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the dock <b>10</b> includes a joint support <b>38</b> disposed in each corner to connect adjacent primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the joint supports <b>38</b> are constructed of corrosion resistant steel. Each joint support <b>38</b> includes a primary joint face <b>40</b> that is connected to a respective primary frame member <b>12</b> and a secondary joint face <b>42</b> that is connected to a respective secondary frame member <b>22</b>. The joint supports <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> include primary and secondary joint faces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> arranged substantially orthogonally relative to each other. Consequently, when the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> are connected to the joint support <b>38</b>, the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> are also arranged substantially orthogonal to each other. Therefore, if a non-orthogonal connection between the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> is desired, a joint support <b>38</b> having primary and secondary joint faces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> arranged in a non orthogonal orientation may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The joint supports <b>38</b> may also include a joint support flange <b>39</b>. The joint support flange <b>39</b> may interface with the primary upper and lower flanges <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of the primary frame member <b>12</b>, as well as the secondary upper and lower flanges <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the secondary frame member <b>22</b> to provide additional structural support.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The joint support <b>38</b> may be connected to the respective primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> by a high-strength adhesive. In this manner, the adhesive is disposed between the primary joint face <b>40</b> and the respective primary frame member <b>12</b>, as well as between the secondary joint face <b>42</b> and the secondary frame member <b>22</b>. A mechanical fastener (not shown) may be used to temporarily connect the joint support <b>38</b> to the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> while the adhesive cures.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The joint support <b>38</b> may also include a plurality of flow channels or joint holes <b>46</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The joint holes <b>46</b> may be located in the primary joint face <b>40</b>, the secondary joint face <b>42</b>, as well as in the corner of the joint support <b>38</b>. The adhesive disposed between the joint support <b>38</b> and the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may flow or ooze through the flow channels/joint holes <b>46</b> when the joint support <b>38</b> is pressed against the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> before the adhesive cures. More specifically, the adhesive may be applied to the primary and secondary joint faces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and/or the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. When the joint support <b>38</b> is pressed against the respective primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>, the adhesive may flow or ooze into the holes <b>46</b>. In effect, the adhesive oozing through the holes <b>46</b> acts as a rivet or other mechanical fastener adding strength of multiple conventional fasteners to each joint. The oozing adhesive further enhances the strength of the connection in shear.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> may be configured to support an upper surface for users to walk on. To this end, one embodiment of the dock <b>10</b> includes a plurality of cross members <b>32</b>. Many of the cross members <b>32</b> are connected to and extend between the pair of primary frame members <b>12</b>. More specifically, each of such cross members <b>32</b> includes opposing end portions that are connected to a respective primary frame member <b>12</b>. The dock <b>10</b> may also include cross members <b>32</b> disposed adjacent the end portions of the dock <b>10</b> that are smaller in length than the intermediate cross members <b>32</b>. In this regard, the cross members <b>32</b> disposed adjacent the end portion may not fully extend between the pair of primary frame members <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cross members <b>32</b> are substantially orthogonal to the primary frame members <b>12</b>. However, the cross members <b>32</b> may be disposed in a non-orthogonal orientation relative to the primary frame members <b>12</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each cross member <b>32</b> includes an upper platform contact face <b>34</b> disposed within a common upper platform contact plane. The upper platform contact faces <b>34</b> collectively form a support upon which an upper walking surface may be disposed. In this manner, it may be desirable that the upper platform contact faces <b>34</b> are substantially level to evenly support the upper walking surface.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The dock <b>10</b> may include a cross member bracket <b>72</b> for connecting a respective cross member to one or more frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. Each cross member <b>32</b> may rest on the cross member bracket <b>72</b>, with no adhesive or fastener engaging the cross member bracket <b>72</b> to the cross member <b>32</b>. This may allow the cross member <b>32</b> to be easily removed from the cross member bracket <b>72</b>, which may be desirable to provide access to the underside of the dock <b>10</b>, where utilities may be located. However, it is understood that other embodiments include an adhesive or fastener to secure the cross member <b>32</b> to the cross member brackets <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plural intermediate cross members <b>32</b> are connected to the primary frame members <b>12</b> by cross member connectors <b>72</b>. Each cross member connector <b>72</b> includes a cross member contact face <b>74</b>, a primary contact face <b>76</b>, and a connector upper surface <b>75</b> extending between the cross member contact face <b>74</b> and the primary contact face <b>76</b>. The primary contact face <b>76</b> is connected to a respective primary frame member <b>12</b>. The cross member connector <b>72</b> may be connected to the primary wall <b>20</b> between the primary upper and lower flanges <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The cross member <b>32</b> may be disposed on two cross member connectors <b>72</b> connected to respective primary frame members <b>12</b>. More specifically, the cross member <b>32</b> may rest on the connector upper surfaces <b>75</b> of the cross member connectors <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, a high strength adhesive is used to join the cross member connector <b>72</b> to the respective cross member <b>32</b> and primary frame member <b>12</b>. The high strength adhesive may be the same high strength adhesive used to connect the joint support <b>38</b> to respective primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. A mechanical fastener may be used to temporarily connect the cross member connector <b>72</b> to the cross member <b>32</b> and the primary frame member <b>12</b> while the high strength adhesive cures. The cross member connector <b>72</b> may include one or more cross member holes <b>73</b> similar to the joint holes <b>46</b> in the joint support <b>38</b>, as described above. The adhesive may be caused to be disposed within the cross member holes <b>73</b> to enhance the connection between the cross member connector <b>72</b>, the cross member <b>32</b>, and the primary frame member <b>12</b>. Although the foregoing describes use of an adhesive to connect the cross member connector <b>72</b> to the cross member <b>32</b> and the primary frame member <b>12</b>, it is understood that other fasteners known by those skilled in the art may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to other aspects of the present invention, additional support for an upper walking surface may be provided by the joint support <b>38</b>. Referring again to the join support <b>38</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, various embodiments of the joint support <b>38</b> may include a joint platform contact face <b>48</b> for providing such additional support. As shown, the joint platform contact face <b>48</b> extends between the primary and secondary joint faces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. Although a pair of joint platform contact faces <b>48</b> are shown in the joint support <b>38</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, only one of the joint platform contact faces <b>48</b> may support an upper walking surface; however the pair of joint platform contact faces <b>48</b> makes the joint support <b>38</b> universal and disposable within any corner of the dock <b>10</b>, as described in more detail above. When the joint support <b>38</b> is disposed within a respective corner of the dock <b>10</b>, the upper joint platform contact face <b>48</b> is disposed within the common upper platform contact plane.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The dock <b>10</b> may include an upper platform <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B. The upper platform <b>54</b> includes an upper walking portion <b>58</b> and a lower contact element <b>60</b> that is disposable in contact with the upper platform contact faces <b>34</b> of the cross members <b>32</b>. The upper platform <b>54</b> may be connected to each upper platform contact face <b>34</b> by double backed adhesive tape <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the lower contact element <b>60</b> may also be disposable in contact with the joint platform contact face <b>48</b> for additional support.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is contemplated that a large upper platform <b>54</b> may be required to provide an upper walking surface for a single dock <b>10</b>. Therefore, the upper platform <b>54</b> may include one or more upper platform elements <b>56</b>. The upper platform elements <b>56</b> collectively define the upper platform <b>54</b>. It is understood that upper platform elements <b>56</b> that vary in size may be used to form the upper platform <b>54</b>. In this manner, various upper platform elements <b>56</b> may be used which vary in length and width in order to accommodate the desired dimensions of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each upper platform element <b>56</b> includes a plurality of upper platform ribs <b>62</b> extending from the upper walking portion <b>58</b> and terminating in a respective lower contact element <b>60</b>. As illustrated, the upper platform ribs <b>62</b> extend generally orthogonally from the upper walking portion <b>58</b> with the lower contact element <b>60</b> being disposable in contact with the cross members <b>32</b>. Each lower contact element <b>60</b> may be connected to one or more cross member <b>32</b> by double backed adhesive tape or other adhesives or mechanical fasteners. In this regard, each lower contact element <b>60</b> may extend along the length of the upper platform element <b>56</b> to connect with multiple cross members <b>32</b>. As such, each upper platform element <b>56</b> may be connected to a plurality of cross member <b>32</b> to create a monocoque construction of the upper platform <b>54</b> to enhance the structural integrity thereof. In other words, each upper platform element <b>56</b> supports adjacent upper platform elements <b>56</b> to improve the overall rigidity and strength of the upper platform <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to one implementation of the invention, the upper platform <b>54</b> is formed of a fiber-reinforced resin material and is formed by a pultrusion process. In addition, it is also contemplated that the cross members <b>32</b> may also be formed of a fiber-reinforced resin material that may be pultruded. However, the upper platform <b>54</b> and cross members <b>32</b> may also be formed of extruded materials, or other materials known by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is contemplated that the upper platform <b>54</b> may include one or more removable end pieces <b>68</b> to allow access to items underneath the upper platform <b>54</b>. The embodiment illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes four removable end pieces <b>68</b> disposed adjacent the end portions of the dock <b>10</b> (the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> does not include removable end pieces <b>68</b>). In one embodiment, the removable end pieces <b>68</b> are connected to joint support <b>38</b> and/or cross member <b>32</b> by commercial post and post double backed tape or other mechanical fasteners. One supplier of post and post double backed tape is the 3M Company headquartered in Maplewood, Minn. In another embodiment, the removable end pieces <b>68</b> simply rest on a support, such as the joint support <b>38</b> and/or cross member <b>32</b>, without being fixedly connected thereto to enable easy removal thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is common for utilities <b>86</b> to extend under a dock <b>10</b>. Such utilities <b>86</b> may include, but are not limited to, potable water, sewage, fire water, electricity, cable and telephone services. Therefore, referring to now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention includes a dock assembly <b>142</b> including a pair of adjacent docks <b>10</b>. The docks <b>10</b> are connected by a medial connector <b>82</b> sized and configured to provide a channel for utilities <b>86</b>. The medial connector <b>82</b> may be connected to a opposing frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> of the adjacent docks <b>10</b>. In particular, the medial connector <b>82</b> may be connected to opposing primary frame members <b>12</b> on docks <b>10</b> connected side-by-side.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The medial connector <b>82</b> may also be desirable in docks <b>10</b> having a large dock width &#x201c;W.&#x201d; As used herein, the dock width W is equal to the distance between the primary frame members <b>12</b>. A greater width W may be achievable by connecting a pair of docks <b>10</b> together via a medial connector <b>82</b>. However, other connection means may also be used, as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to another aspect of the present invention, the dock <b>10</b> is modular to allow for easy assembly thereof. To this end, many of the components may be prefabricated to enable on-site assembly of the dock <b>10</b>. A modular dock generally requires less time to assemble, and is cheaper to manufacture and transport. In one particular embodiment, the primary frame member <b>12</b>, secondary frame member <b>22</b>, cross members <b>32</b>, and upper platform elements <b>56</b> may be formed of standard dimensions. The components may be available to construct a dock <b>10</b> that is 20&#x2032;&#xd7;3&#x2032;, 20&#x2032;&#xd7;4&#x2032;, 20&#x2032;&#xd7;6&#x2032;, and 20&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032;. Such standard dock sizes are exemplary in nature and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Although the foregoing describes a module dock design, it is also understood that a custom dock <b>10</b> having dimensions that differ from the standard sizes may also be constructed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, various aspects of the present invention are directed toward a float system <b>90</b> for use with the dock <b>10</b>. The float system <b>90</b> is intended to provide a buoyant force to the dock <b>10</b> to keep the upper walking portion substantially above the body of water <b>94</b>. The float system <b>90</b> includes a floatation shell <b>92</b> that is disposable beneath a water facing surface <b>96</b> of the dock <b>10</b>. In one particular embodiment, a low density polyurethane foam is used to cast the basic shape of the floatation shell <b>92</b>. After curing for a few seconds, the floatation shell <b>92</b> is sheathed with a high density polyurethane skin. In another embodiment, the floatation shell <b>92</b> is formed of a polyethylene sheath containing an expanded polystyrene core.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The floatation shell <b>92</b> includes a shell base <b>102</b> having a shell base upper surface <b>103</b>. A pair of opposing floatation fins <b>104</b> extends away from the shell base <b>102</b> to define respective fin distal portions <b>106</b>. The distance between the shell base upper surface <b>103</b> and the fins <b>104</b> is referred to as the shell depth &#x201c;D.&#x201d; The size of the shell depth D may vary as desired. According to various aspects of the present invention, the shell depth D is deepest at the fin distal portions <b>106</b>. It may desirable that the floatation fins <b>104</b> extend from opposing lateral portions <b>98</b> of the floatation shell <b>92</b> to increase the stability of the dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As can be seen from the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the floatation fins <b>104</b> extend from the shell base <b>102</b> toward the water <b>94</b>. Each floatation fin <b>104</b> includes a fin medial face <b>108</b> and a fin lateral face <b>110</b> to define a fin width &#x201c;F&#x201d; therebetween. The floatation fin <b>104</b> is configured such that the fin width F decreases from the shell base <b>102</b> towards the fin distal portion <b>106</b>. In other words, the fin width F is the smallest at the fin distal portion <b>106</b>. It is understood that the fin width F may decrease in a uniform or non-uniform manner.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The size and configuration of the floatation shell <b>92</b> may be varied to accommodate various weights and dock configurations. For instance, the shell depth D may be increased to provide more buoyancy for a heavier dock. In addition, by altering the shell depth D, the freeboard height may also be altered. As used herein, the freeboard height refers to the distance between the water level and the upper platform <b>54</b>. In addition to altering the shell depth D, the fin width F may also be altered to enhance the lateral stability of the dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the particular embodiment shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the floatation shell <b>92</b> includes a pair of floatation elements <b>114</b>, which collectively define the floatation shell <b>92</b>. Each floatation element <b>114</b> includes a floatation medial face <b>116</b> and a floatation lateral face <b>117</b>. The floatation medial faces <b>116</b> of the respective floatation elements <b>114</b> are disposed in opposed relation to each other, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this manner, the floatation fins <b>104</b> are disposed laterally of the floatation medial face <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The floatation shell <b>92</b> also defines a floatation cavity <b>100</b>. According to one embodiment, a buoyant element <b>112</b> is disposed within the floatation cavity <b>100</b> to enhance the buoyancy of the float system <b>90</b>. The buoyant element <b>112</b> may be constructed out of a foam material, or other buoyant materials known by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to one particular implementation, the floatation shell <b>92</b> includes an attachment flange <b>118</b> connected to the floatation shell <b>92</b>. In this manner, the attachment flange <b>118</b> may extend from the floatation shell <b>92</b>. The attachment flange <b>118</b> includes one or more fastener openings <b>120</b> extending therethrough. The fastener openings <b>120</b> may be aligned with openings on the dock <b>10</b> to allow a mechanical fastener, such as a bolt to extend therethrough, to attach the floatation shell <b>92</b> to the dock <b>10</b>. As shown in the exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fastener openings <b>120</b> of the attachment flange <b>118</b> are aligned with openings within the cross member <b>32</b> of the dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although the Figures show a nut and bolt connector for attaching the floatation shell <b>92</b> to the dock <b>10</b>, it is also understood that other fasteners may also be used to attach the floatation shell <b>92</b> to the dock <b>10</b>. For instance, the dock <b>10</b> may include a spring biased locking member which may engage with the fastener openings <b>120</b> to connect the floatation shell <b>92</b> to the dock <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the floatation shell <b>92</b> may include a flange which is engaged within a groove formed within the dock <b>10</b> for attachment thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a floatation shell <b>92</b> having a plurality of press-fit engagement members <b>122</b> extending from the shell base <b>102</b>. The press-fit engagement members <b>122</b> may be configured to engage with the dock <b>10</b>. The dock <b>10</b> may include a dock engagement member that engages with the press-fit engagement member <b>122</b>. In one implementation, the press-fit engagement members <b>122</b> may engage with the upper platform <b>54</b>. More specifically, individual engagement members <b>122</b> may be received between adjacent upper platform ribs <b>62</b> to secure the floatation shell <b>92</b> to the dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The floatation shell <b>92</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be desirable for purposes of wave attenuation. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of the floatation shell <b>190</b> which may be more desirable for creating a more stable walking surface. The floatation shell <b>190</b> includes a pair of floatation elements <b>192</b>, each having a medial fin <b>194</b> terminating in a fin distal portion <b>202</b>. In this manner, the fin <b>194</b> is disposed under the medial portion of the dock <b>10</b>, as opposed to the lateral portion of the dock <b>10</b>. Each floatation element <b>192</b> also includes a medial face <b>196</b>, a lateral face <b>198</b> and an upper face <b>200</b>. The distance between the medial face <b>196</b> and the lateral face <b>198</b> is referred to herein as the fin width, &#x201c;FW,&#x201d; while the distance between the upper face <b>200</b> and the fin distal portion <b>202</b> is referred to as the fin depth, &#x201c;FD.&#x201d; The fin width FW and fin depth FD may vary to achieve desired floatation characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The medial fin <b>194</b> may be filled with sand <b>204</b> or other material known in the art to provide additional weight to the medial fin <b>194</b>. The additional weight provides more stability to the dock <b>10</b>. The amount of sand <b>204</b> or other material may be varied according to the particular size and weight of the respective dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As the dock <b>10</b> floats in the body of water <b>94</b>, it is typically restrained to maintain the dock <b>10</b> in a desired location. One common technique of restraining the dock <b>10</b> is to connect the dock <b>10</b> to one or more pilings. In this manner, the dock <b>10</b> typically includes one or more a holes through which the pilings <b>126</b> protrude. Therefore, as the water currents urge the dock <b>10</b> away from its desired location, the protruding pilings <b>126</b> keep the dock <b>10</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In rough water conditions, the dock <b>10</b> may traverse up and down the piling <b>126</b>. The traversal of the dock <b>10</b> along the piling <b>126</b> may be very unsteady. Furthermore, the waves may cause the dock <b>10</b> to crash into the piling <b>126</b> under certain conditions, which generally creates a very unstable walking surface. Repeated contact between the dock <b>10</b> and the piling <b>126</b> may cause damage to the dock <b>10</b>. Therefore, various aspects of the present invention include a roller <b>124</b> for use on a dock <b>10</b> positioned near a piling <b>126</b>. The roller <b>124</b> may be configured to provide a smoother traversal of the dock <b>10</b> along the piling <b>126</b>. In addition, the roller <b>124</b> may act as a shock-absorber between the dock <b>10</b> and the piling <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The roller <b>124</b> includes a spring biased bracket <b>128</b> having a dock contact portion <b>130</b> and a bracket sidewall <b>134</b>. The dock contact portion <b>130</b> is engageable with the dock <b>10</b> and includes a dock contact upper surface <b>132</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the dock contact portion <b>130</b> is disposed in direct contact with the dock <b>10</b>. The dock contact portion <b>130</b> is connected to the dock <b>10</b> via a mechanical fastener, such as a screw, nut and bolt, nails, or the like. It is also contemplated that the dock contact portion <b>130</b> may be integrally formed with the dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the dock contact portion <b>130</b> is engaged with the dock <b>10</b>, the dock contact upper surface <b>132</b> faces away from the dock <b>10</b>. In this manner, the dock contact upper surface <b>132</b> may be exposed and facing upwardly, away from the water. The mechanical fastener fastening the dock contact portion <b>130</b> to the dock <b>10</b> may be disposed in contact with the dock contact upper surface <b>132</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The dock contact portion <b>130</b> is connected to the bracket sidewall <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> is integrally formed with the dock contact portion <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. In another embodiment, the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> is detachably connected with the dock contact portion <b>130</b>. In this manner, the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> may be removed from the dock contact portion <b>130</b>, which may be desirable if the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> breaks.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The bracket sidewall <b>134</b> includes a sidewall lower edge <b>136</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the sidewall lower edge <b>136</b> is disposed along the end portion of the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> facing the dock contact portion <b>130</b>. Furthermore, in the particular embodiment illustrated in the Figures, the bracket <b>128</b> includes a bend to dispose the bracket sidewall <b>134</b> at least partially over the dock contact portion <b>130</b>. In this manner, the sidewall lower edge <b>136</b> and the dock contact upper surface <b>132</b> define a bracket angle, &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The spring biased bracket <b>128</b> is moveable between a compressed position and an extended position. The bracket <b>128</b> may move between the compressed and extended positions to absorb impact between the dock <b>10</b> and the piling <b>126</b>. The bracket angle &#x3b8; increases as the spring biased bracket <b>128</b> moves from the compressed position to the extended position. The spring biased bracket <b>128</b> is biased towards the extended position. Therefore, when the dock <b>10</b> initially contacts a piling <b>126</b>, the bracket <b>128</b> is likely in an extended position. As the dock <b>10</b> is urged toward the piling <b>126</b>, the bracket <b>128</b> moves toward the compressed position and absorbs impact between the dock <b>10</b> and the piling <b>126</b> to provide a more stable dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The inherent physical properties of the bracket <b>128</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>A, and <b>11</b>B bias the bracket <b>128</b> toward the extended position. However, other embodiments may include additional biasing elements, such as a leaf spring, coil spring <b>125</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>), or other biasing mechanisms known in the art to provide additional biasing forces to the bracket <b>128</b>. In embodiments where the biasing force is provided by an external element, such as a coil spring <b>125</b>, the bracket <b>128</b> may include a bracket hinge <b>129</b> to enable pivotal movement of the bracket <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring now to the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B there is shown a bracket <b>128</b> having a stopper <b>140</b> configured to limit the amount of movement between the compressed and extended positions. As shown, the stopper <b>140</b> extends from a bracket upper wall <b>141</b> toward the dock contact upper face <b>132</b>. When the bracket <b>128</b> moves from the extended position toward the compressed position, the stopper <b>140</b> is brought closer to the dock contact upper face <b>132</b>. Eventually, the stopper <b>140</b> is brought into contact with the dock contact upper face <b>132</b> to mitigate further movement in that direction. Although the stopper <b>140</b> is shown extending from the bracket upper wall <b>141</b>, it is also contemplated that the stopper may extend from the dock contact upper face <b>132</b> toward the bracket upper wall <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The roller <b>124</b> additionally includes a wheel <b>128</b> rotatably connected to the bracket sidewall <b>134</b>. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the bracket <b>128</b> includes a pair of opposing bracket sidewalls <b>134</b> disposed on opposing sides of the wheel <b>134</b>. A rotation rod may extend through the wheel <b>128</b> to allow the wheel <b>128</b> to freely rotate thereabout. The rotation rod may be connected to the bracket sidewall(s) <b>134</b> by a mechanical fastener, such as a nut and bolt, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In operation, the wheel <b>138</b> is engageable with the piling <b>126</b> and rotates as the dock <b>10</b> traverses along the piling <b>126</b>. The spring biased bracket <b>128</b> may move between the extended and compressed positions to enhance the stability of the dock <b>10</b>. In this manner, the brackets <b>128</b> may act as shock absorbers. Furthermore, movement of the brackets <b>128</b> between the extended and compressed positions mitigates damage to the wheels <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Several of the above-described docks <b>10</b> may be combined to form a dock assembly <b>142</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. The docks <b>10</b> may be easily connected in an end-to-end configuration, a side-by-side configuration or in an orthogonal configuration. A dock connector <b>36</b> may be employed to connect adjacent docks <b>10</b> in an orthogonal configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In particular, the dock connector <b>36</b> may be mounted on one dock <b>10</b> to facilitate orthogonal connection to an adjacent dock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, docks <b>10</b> are connected by a dock strap <b>188</b>. The dock strap <b>188</b> attaches to the primary upper and lower flanges <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, as well as the secondary upper and lower flanges <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of adjacent docks <b>10</b>. The dock strap <b>188</b> includes dock connector external plate <b>180</b> that extends between the adjacent docks <b>10</b>. A dock connector bolt <b>186</b> extends connects the connector external plate <b>180</b> to the dock <b>10</b>. A connection gasket <b>184</b> is disposed between, and extends along the dock interface between the adjacent docks <b>10</b>. The connection gasket <b>184</b> mitigates unwanted contact between adjacent docks <b>10</b>. For instance, if the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> are formed of a fiberglass material, the gasket <b>156</b> mitigates fiberglass-to-fiberglass contact. In one embodiment, the connection gasket <b>184</b> is formed of a neoprene material; however, other materials may also be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The dock strap <b>188</b> may be connected to the upper surfaces of the adjoining docks <b>10</b> to achieve the connection. In particular, the dock strap <b>188</b> may be connected to the primary frame members <b>12</b> and/or secondary frame members <b>22</b>. A bolt <b>152</b> may connect the dock strap <b>188</b> to the respective joint support <b>38</b> connecting the primary and secondary frame members <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. The dock strap <b>188</b> may be formed of a metallic, plastic, or other material known by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The dock strap <b>188</b> is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>. As depicted, the dock strap <b>188</b> is used to join the dock <b>10</b> with a piling platform; however, it is understood that the dock strap <b>188</b> may be used to connect adjacent docks <b>10</b>. The dock strap <b>188</b> may mitigate unwanted hogging and sagging of interconnected docks <b>10</b>. As used herein, sagging refers to when adjacent docks <b>10</b> are disposed in a v-shaped configuration, while hogging refers to when docks <b>10</b> are disposed in an inverse v-shaped configuration. Rough water conditions may cause adjacent docks <b>10</b> to hog or sag.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The dock assembly <b>142</b> may be configured in the shape of a slip to allow for docking of a water vessel <b>144</b>, such as a motor boat or sailboat. In this manner, the dock assembly <b>142</b> may define a u-shape having an end portion <b>145</b> and two side portions <b>147</b>. A corner portion <b>146</b> may be provided between adjoining docks <b>10</b> to provide structural support. In general, when the boat <b>144</b> pulls into the slip, the bow <b>148</b> of the boat <b>144</b> is disposed facing the end portion <b>145</b> of the dock assembly <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As previously stated, several docks <b>10</b> may be connected to form a dock assembly <b>142</b>. This may be advantageous for a marina having large numbers of slips. The simple attachment and detachment of the docks <b>10</b> may allow the marina to quickly and easily reconfigure their slip configuration to accommodate different numbers and sizes of boats. For instance, sailboats tend to be narrower than motorboats. Therefore, the width of the slip for a sailboat may be much narrower than the width of the slip for a motorboat. For marinas having more sailboats than motorboats, thinner slips may be desirable. However, the slips may be easily reconfigured to accommodate wider motorboats.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Once the boat <b>144</b> is positioned within the slip, the boat <b>144</b> is typically tied or connected to the dock assembly <b>142</b>. To this end, various aspects of the invention are directed toward a cleat <b>158</b> configured to provide a tie-down point for a boat <b>144</b> within a slip. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the cleat <b>158</b> is connectable to a primary or secondary frame member <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and comprises an upper cleat portion <b>159</b> and a lower cleat portion <b>161</b>. The upper cleat portion <b>159</b> includes a cleat plate <b>164</b> disposable adjacent the frame member <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and a pair of cleat supports <b>162</b> extending from the cleat plate <b>164</b>. A cleat bar <b>160</b> extends between and beyond the cleat supports <b>162</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.
