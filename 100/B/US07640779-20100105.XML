<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of international application PCT/JP2004/003123 filed 10 Mar. 2004 which designated the U.S. and claims benefit of JP 2003-095405, filed 31 Mar. 2003, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hemming apparatus for hemming an edge portion of an outer panel of a motor vehicle or the like by a working tool such as a hemming punch, and more particularly to a holder unit holding a working tool such as a hemming punch used in such a hemming apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in a holder unit of a hemming apparatus, a working tool holder holding a working tool is movably supported on a base so that the working tool can be disposed at a nonworking position and a working position. And, the movement of the working tool holder to the nonworking position of the working tool after working is normally effected by the resiliency of a resilient body such as a coil spring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this type of hemming apparatus, initial adjustment is performed on the mutual position between the working tool on the one hand, and a lower die and an upper die on the other hand. Since this initial adjustment is extremely difficult if the resiliency of the resilient body is being applied to the working tool holder, the initial adjustment is performed after temporarily demounting the resilient body from the holder unit. The resilient body is mounted again on the holder unit upon completion of the initial adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Incidentally, the demounting and mounting operation of such a resilient body involves complicated and troublesome operations including such as the disassembly and reassembly of the holder unit, as well as the removal of the working tool holder from the base and the reinstallation thereof on the base. Furthermore, in some type of holder unit, the operation of unloading and reloading the resilient body having powerful resiliency, particularly the coil spring, is required, with the result that the demounting and mounting operation of the resilient body becomes extremely dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-described problems are not limited to the initial adjustment and similarly occur in the case of readjustment as well.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described aspects, and its object is to provide a holder unit which, by making the resiliency of the resilient body small without demounting the resilient body, makes it possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the working tool on the one hand, and the lower die and the upper die on the other hand, and which makes it possible to demount and remount the resilient body easily and safely and to easily perform the assembly and reassembly thereof, as well as a hemming apparatus having this holder unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A holder unit in accordance with a first aspect of the present invention comprises: a base; a working tool holder which is movably supported on the base so that a working tool to be mounted can be disposed at a nonworking position and a working position; and resilient means for resiliently urging the working tool holder so as to dispose the working tool at the nonworking position. Here, the working tool holder is provided with a through hole having one end open at one end surface of the working tool holder and another end open at another end surface of the working tool holder, and the resilient means includes a resilient body disposed between the one end and the other end of the through hole, a resiliency receiving body which is detachably fixed to the working tool holder at one end side of the through hole and receives the resiliency of the resilient body, and an abutment body which is movably disposed in the working tool holder at another end side of the through hole, and which is adapted to abut against the base by the resiliency from the resilient body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the holder unit in accordance with a first aspect, in the through hole having one end open at one end surface of the working tool holder and the other end open at the other end surface of the working tool holder, the resilient body is disposed between the one end and the other end, and the resiliency receiving body for receiving the resiliency of this resilient body is detachably fixed to the working tool holder at the one end side of the through hole. Therefore, the application of the resiliency of the resilient body to the abutment body can be decreased by loosening the fixation of the resiliency receiving body to the working tool holder or by removing the resiliency receiving body from the working tool holder. Thus, the working tool holder, which has been moved to dispose the working tool to the nonworking position, can be moved to dispose the working tool to the working position without being subjected to a large resistance due to the resiliency of the resilient body. As a result, the resiliency of the resilient body can be made small without removing the resilient body, and it is possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the working tool on the one hand, and the lower die and the upper die on the other hand. Furthermore, as a result of the fact that the resilient body can be simply inserted into and withdrawn from the working tool holder, the disassembly and reassembly can be performed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred example, the resiliency receiving body has a threaded plug which is threadedly secured to the working tool holder at the one end of the through hole, as in the holder unit in accordance with a second aspect of the invention. In this case, it suffices if the holder unit has a screw threadedly secured to the working tool holder so as to prevent the threaded plug from coming off the one end of the through hole, as in the holder unit in accordance with a third aspect of the invention. As the threaded plug, it is possible to cite as a preferred example an annular or cylindrical threaded plug in which a thread is provided on its cylindrical outer peripheral surface, and which has in its central portion a hexagonal through hole or a hexagonal recess for fitting a rotating tool therein, and can be inserted in its entirety into the through hole. However, the threaded plug may be another one, such as a so-called bolt having an enlarged head. In addition, in another preferred example, the resiliency receiving body has a closure plate attached to the one end face of the working tool holder by means of a screw so as to close the one end of the through hole, as in the holder unit in accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The abutment body may be adapted to slidably abut against the base. In this case, as in the holder unit in accordance with a fifth aspect of the invention, the abutment body may have a cylindrical body or a hollow cylindrical body which is movably disposed in the working tool holder at the other end side of the through hole and a sliding body which is integrally provided on the cylindrical body or the hollow cylindrical body and slidably abuts against the base. Here, the sliding body may be a projection which is integrally provided on the cylindrical body or the hollow cylindrical body, and in which a portion slidably abutting against the base has a semicircular arc-shaped surface or a semispherical surface. In addition, the abutment body may be adapted to roll on and abut against the base. In this case, as in the holder unit in accordance with a sixth aspect of the invention, the abutment body may have a cylindrical body or a hollow cylindrical body which is movably disposed in the working tool holder at the other end side of the through hole and a rotating body which is rotatably held by the cylindrical body or the hollow cylindrical body and rolls on and abuts against the base. Here, as in the holder unit in accordance with a seventh aspect of the invention, the rotating body may be constituted by a spherical body or a roller which is rotatably held by the cylindrical body or the hollow cylindrical body. If the abutment body is such an abutment body, a spherical body or a roller can be made to roll on and abut against the base, so that the frictional resistance can be favorably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As in the holder unit in accordance with an eighth aspect of the invention, the working tool holder may include a holder body which has the through hole and is rotatably supported on the base by means of a shaft member, and a cam roller attached to the holder body so as to abut against a cam driver. Alternatively, as in the holder unit in accordance with a ninth aspect of the invention, the working tool holder may include a holder body which has the through hole and is supported on the base in such a manner as to be movable in parallel by means of a pair of parallel link members. In the case of such a holder unit in accordance with the ninth aspect, one of the pair of parallel link members has a link body and a cam roller attached to the link body so as to abut against a cam driver. In addition, in the case of such a holder unit in accordance with the ninth aspect, the base, the link body, and another one of the pair of parallel link members, and the holder body constitute a parallel link mechanism, as in the holder unit in accordance with a 10th aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another preferred example, as in the holder unit in accordance with an 11th aspect of the invention, the working tool holder has the through hole and is supported on the base rotatably and movably in parallel by means of a coupling column member and a pair of parallel link members. In the holder unit in accordance with the 11th aspect, the coupling column member is rotatably coupled to the base by means of a shaft member, each of the pair of parallel link members is rotatably coupled to respective ones of the working tool holder and the coupling column member, and respective ones of the coupling column member and one of the pair of parallel link members have cam rollers which respectively abut against cam drivers. In the case of the holder unit in accordance with the 11th aspect of the invention, the working tool holder, the coupling column member, and the pair of parallel link members constitute a parallel link mechanism, as in the holder unit in accordance with a 12th aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As in the holder unit in accordance with a 13th aspect of the invention, the holder unit in accordance with the 11th or 12th aspect may preferably further comprise a transmitting body interposed between the working tool holder and the coupling column member so as to transmit to the working tool holder the rotation of the coupling column member for disposing the working tool at the working position and to transmit to the coupling column member the rotation of the working tool holder by the resilient means for disposing the working tool to the nonworking position. In this case, as in the holder unit in accordance with a 14th aspect of the invention, the transmitting body may be secured to the coupling column member and slidably abut against the working tool holder.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As in the holder unit in accordance with a 15th aspect of the invention, the resilient body preferably has at least one of a coil spring, urethane rubber, and a gas spring. More preferably, the resilient body has a coil spring as n the holder unit in accordance with a 16th aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention, it is possible to provide a holder unit which, by making the resiliency of the resilient body small without demounting the resilient body, makes it possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the working tool on the one hand, and the lower die and the upper die on the other hand, and which makes it possible to demount and remount the resilient body easily and safely to easily perform the assembly and reassembly thereof, as well as a hemming apparatus having this holder unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a hemming apparatus <b>1</b> in accordance with this embodiment is comprised of a holder unit <b>2</b>, a lower die <b>3</b> on which the holder unit <b>2</b> is installed, and an upper die <b>4</b> which is installed above the lower die <b>3</b> vertically movably.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The holder unit <b>2</b> includes a base <b>5</b> secured to the lower die <b>3</b> by means of bolts or the like; a working tool holder <b>7</b> which is supported on the base <b>5</b> movably, i.e., rotatably in A and B directions in this embodiment, so that a hemming punch <b>6</b> as a working tool to be mounted can be disposed at a nonworking position (the, position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>) and a working position (the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); and a resilient means <b>8</b> for resiliently urging the working tool holder <b>7</b> so as to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> at the nonworking position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fixed lower die <b>3</b> includes a base portion <b>10</b> as well as a lower die block <b>12</b> which is secured to the base portion <b>10</b> and on an upper surface of which an unworked plate (workpiece) <b>11</b> such as an outer panel of a motor vehicle serving as the workpiece is placed. In the lower die block <b>12</b>, an edge portion <b>13</b> extending perpendicularly to the plane of the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is adapted to function as a hemming die.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The base <b>5</b> includes a base plate <b>15</b> secured to the base portion <b>10</b> of the lower die <b>3</b> by bolts or the like; a stopper member <b>16</b> and an intermediate plate <b>17</b> secured to the base plate <b>15</b> by bolts, welding, or the like; and a shaft supporting member <b>18</b> and a receiving plate <b>19</b> secured to the intermediate plate <b>17</b> by bolts, welding, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The working tool holder <b>7</b> includes a holder body <b>22</b> supported on the shaft supporting member <b>18</b> of the base <b>5</b> by means of a shaft member <b>21</b> rotatably in the A and B directions; a through hole <b>25</b> bored in the holder body <b>22</b> and having one end open at an upper surface <b>23</b>, i.e., one end surface of the holder body <b>22</b>, and the other end open at a lower surface <b>24</b>, i.e., the other end surface of the holder body <b>22</b>; and a cam roller <b>28</b> attached to the holder body <b>22</b> rotatably by means of a shaft member <b>27</b> so as to abut against a cam driver <b>26</b> installed on the upper die <b>4</b> on lowering of the upper die <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The holder body <b>22</b> includes a front plate portion <b>32</b> having a thick-walled portion <b>31</b>, as well as a pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> formed integrally with the thick-walled portion <b>31</b> of the front plate portion <b>32</b> in such a manner as to oppose each other. The through hole <b>25</b> is bored in the thick-walled portion <b>31</b>. The shaft members <b>21</b> and <b>27</b> are supported by the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> in such a manner as to bridge the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The shaft supporting member <b>18</b> and the cam roller <b>28</b> are disposed between the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The hemming punch <b>6</b> is detachably mounted on a front surface <b>35</b> of the front plate portion <b>32</b> by means of a mounting tool <b>36</b> and bolts or the like. A thrust bearing <b>37</b> is disposed between each of the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and the shaft supporting member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The resilient means <b>8</b> includes a coil spring <b>41</b> disposed between the one end and the other end of the through hole <b>25</b> and serving as a resilient body; a resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> which is detachably fixed to the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> at the one end side of the through hole <b>25</b>, and is adapted to receive the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>; and an abutment body <b>43</b> which is disposed in the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> at the other end side of the through hole <b>25</b> movably along the direction in which the through hole <b>25</b> extends, and which is adapted to abut against the receiving plate <b>19</b> of the base <b>5</b> by the resiliency from the coil spring <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> has a closure plate <b>46</b> which is attached to the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> by means of screws <b>45</b> so as to close the one end of the through hole <b>25</b>. The abutment body <b>43</b> has a cylindrical body <b>47</b> which is disposed in the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> at the other end side of the through hole <b>25</b> movably along the direction in which the through hole <b>25</b> extends, as well as a spherical body <b>48</b> rotatably held at a distal end portion of the cylindrical body <b>47</b> and serving as a rotating body which rolls on and abuts against the receiving plate <b>19</b> of the base <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The resilient means <b>8</b> constantly rotatively urges the working tool holder <b>7</b> in the B direction since the spherical body <b>48</b> abuts against the receiving plate <b>19</b> by the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>, and the closure plate <b>46</b> receives the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. As a result, when the upper die <b>4</b> is raised, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the working tool holder <b>7</b> is rotated in the B direction, and abuts against the stopper member <b>16</b> at the side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> of its holder body <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The upper die <b>4</b> which is capable of being raised and lowered includes a base portion <b>51</b> fixed-to a hydraulic ram or the like; an upper blade <b>52</b> secured to the base portion <b>51</b>; an upper die block <b>55</b> which is supported by the base portion <b>51</b> by means of a resilient body <b>53</b> and to which a pressing member <b>54</b> is secured; a driver supporting member <b>56</b> which is secured to the base portion <b>51</b> and supports the cam driver <b>26</b>; and a forcible-rotation guiding member <b>57</b> secured to the base portion <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cam driver <b>26</b> has an inclined cam surface <b>61</b> which abuts against the cam roller <b>28</b> on lowering of the upper die <b>4</b> and rotates the holder body <b>22</b> in the A direction against the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> by means of that cam roller <b>28</b>, as well as an inclined cam surface <b>62</b> which abuts against the cam roller <b>28</b> on further lowering of the upper die <b>4</b> and guides the rotation of the holder body <b>22</b> in the B direction based on the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> by means of that cam roller <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The forcible-rotation guiding member <b>57</b> has a pair of inclined cam surfaces <b>66</b>. In a case where the holder body <b>22</b>, after being rotated in the A direction by the inclined cam surface <b>61</b>,while lowering of the upper die <b>4</b>, fails to be rotated in the B direction by the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> due to some cause or other, the inclined cam surfaces <b>66</b> abut against end portions <b>65</b> of the shaft member <b>27</b> projecting from the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and hence forcibly cause the rotation of the holder body <b>22</b> in the B direction due to the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> by means of those end portions <b>65</b>, thereby ensuring the guided rotation of the holder body <b>22</b> in the B direction by the inclined cam surfaces <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the above-described hemming apparatus <b>1</b>, when the unworked plate <b>11</b> having a bent edge portion <b>71</b> to be subjected to hemming is placed on the lower die block <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper die <b>4</b> capable of being raised and lowered is lowered by the hydraulic ram or the like. As the upper die <b>4</b> is thus lowered, a vicinity of the bent edge portion <b>71</b> of the unworked plate <b>11</b> is resiliently pressed against and held onto the edge portion <b>13</b> by the pressing member <b>54</b> which is lowered together with the upper die block <b>55</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As the upper die <b>4</b> continues to be lowered, the cam roller <b>28</b> abuts against the inclined cam surface <b>61</b>, causing the working tool holder <b>7</b> to be gradually rotated about the shaft member <b>21</b> in the A direction against the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. As the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thus rotated in the A direction, a distal end portion <b>72</b> of the hemming punch <b>6</b> further bends the bent edge portion <b>71</b> of the unworked plate <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As the upper die <b>4</b> is further lowered, the cam roller <b>28</b> releases its abutment against the inclined cam surface <b>61</b> and abuts against the inclined cam surface <b>62</b>, whereupon the working tool holder <b>7</b> is gradually rotated about the shaft member <b>21</b> in the B direction. As the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thus rotated in the B direction, the distal end portion <b>72</b> of the hemming punch <b>6</b> moves away from the bent edge portion <b>71</b> of the unworked plate <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Meanwhile, as the upper die <b>4</b> is lowered, the upper blade <b>52</b> presses the bent edge portion <b>71</b>, thereby providing the bent edge portion <b>71</b> with final hemming. After this final hemming of the bent edge portion <b>71</b>, the upper die <b>4</b> is raised by the hydraulic ram or the like, and the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thereafter operated conversely to the above-described operation by the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>, and is returned, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the holder unit <b>2</b>, in the through hole <b>25</b> having one end open at the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> and the other end open at the lower surface <b>24</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b>, the coil spring <b>41</b> is disposed between the one end and the other end of the through hole <b>25</b>. In addition, the closure plate <b>46</b> of the resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> for receiving the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> is detachably fixed to the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> by means of the screws <b>45</b> at the one end side of the through hole <b>25</b>. Therefore, the application of the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> to the spherical body <b>48</b> can be decreased by loosening the fixation of the closure plate <b>46</b> to the holder body <b>22</b> or by removing the closure plate <b>46</b> from the holder body <b>22</b> by turning the screws <b>45</b>. Thus, the working tool holder <b>7</b>, which has been rotated to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the nonworking position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can be easily rotated manually to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> without being subjected to the large resistance due to the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. As a result, the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> can be made small without removing the coil spring <b>41</b>, and it is possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the hemming punch <b>6</b> on the one hand, and the edge portion <b>13</b> of the lower die <b>3</b> and the upper blade <b>52</b> of the upper die <b>4</b> on the other hand. Furthermore, as a result of the fact that the coil spring <b>41</b> can be simply inserted into and withdrawn from the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b>, the disassembly and reassembly can be performed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With the above-described holder unit <b>2</b>, the resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> is constructed by including the closure plate <b>46</b> attached to the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> by means of the screws <b>45</b>. Alternatively, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> may be constructed by including an annular threaded plug <b>75</b> which is threadedly secured at its outer peripheral surface to the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> at the one end of the through hole <b>25</b>. In this case, a screw <b>77</b> may be threadedly secured to the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> so that its enlarged head <b>76</b> engages the plug <b>75</b>. The threaded plug <b>75</b> may be prevented from coming-off from the one end of the through hole <b>25</b> by means of such a screw <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, with the holder unit <b>2</b>, the base <b>5</b> is constructed by including the intermediate plate <b>17</b> and the shaft supporting member <b>18</b> disposed between the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. Alternatively, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the base <b>5</b> may be constructed by omitting the intermediate plate <b>17</b>, by directly securing the stopper member <b>16</b> and the receiving plate <b>19</b> to the base plate <b>15</b> by bolts, welding, or the like, and by including the pair of shaft supporting members <b>18</b> directly secured to the base plate <b>15</b> by bolts, welding, or the like. In this case, the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> may be constructed by including a main body portion <b>81</b> disposed between the pair of shaft supporting members <b>18</b> and having the through hole <b>25</b> bored therein, as well as a pair of shaft receiving portions <b>82</b> formed integrally on the main body portion <b>81</b> and opposed to each other. With the working tool holder <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the shaft member <b>21</b> bridges the pair of shaft supporting members <b>18</b>; the cam roller <b>28</b> disposed between the pair of bearing portions <b>82</b> is rotatably supported by the pair of bearing portions <b>82</b> by means of the shaft member <b>27</b>; the hemming punch <b>6</b> is detachably attached to the front surface <b>35</b> of the main body portion <b>81</b> by bolts or the like; and the thrust bearing <b>37</b> is disposed between each of the pair of shaft supporting members <b>18</b> and the main body portion <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also according to the above-described holder unit <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in the through hole <b>25</b> having one end open at the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> and the other end open at the lower surface <b>24</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b>, the coil spring <b>41</b> is disposed between the one end and the other end of the through hole <b>25</b>. In addition, the closure plate <b>46</b> of the resiliency receiving body <b>42</b> for receiving the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> is detachably fixed to the upper surface <b>23</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b> by means of the screws <b>45</b> at the one end side of the through hole <b>25</b>. Therefore, the application of the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> to the spherical body <b>48</b> can be decreased by loosening the fixation of the closure plate <b>46</b> to the holder body <b>22</b> or by removing the closure plate <b>46</b> from the holder body <b>22</b> by turning the screws <b>45</b>. Thus, the working tool holder <b>7</b>, which has been rotated to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the nonworking position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can be rotated to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> without being subjected to the large resistance due to the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. As a result, the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> can be made small without removing the coil spring <b>41</b>, and it is possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the hemming punch <b>6</b> on the one hand, and the edge portion <b>13</b> of the lower die <b>3</b> and the upper blade <b>52</b> of the upper die <b>4</b> on the other hand. Furthermore, as a result of the fact that the coil spring <b>41</b> can be simply inserted into and withdrawn from the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b>, the disassembly and reassembly can be performed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, the working tool holder <b>7</b> may include the holder body <b>22</b> which is supported on the base <b>5</b> in such a manner as to be movable in parallel by means of a pair of parallel link members <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>. In this case, the base <b>5</b> includes a base portion <b>87</b> secured to the base portion <b>10</b> of the lower die <b>3</b> by bolts or the like, as well as a pair of shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> formed integrally on the base portion <b>87</b> and opposed to each other. Of the pair of parallel link members <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>, one parallel link member <b>85</b> has a link body <b>92</b> having one end portion supported rotatably by the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> by means of a shaft member <b>90</b> and the other end supported rotatably by the pair of shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> by means of a shaft member <b>91</b>, as well as the cam roller <b>28</b> attached rotatably to the link body <b>92</b> by means of the shaft member <b>27</b> so as to abut against the cam driver <b>26</b> installed on the upper die <b>4</b> on lowering of the upper die <b>4</b>. The link body <b>92</b> has a main body portion <b>93</b> shaped in the form of a thick-walled plate and a pair of side plate portions <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> formed integrally on the main body portion <b>93</b> in face-to-face relation with each other, and is rotatably coupled to each of the side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and the shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> by means of the shaft members <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> at the one end portion and the other end portion of the main body portion <b>93</b>. The shaft member <b>27</b> supported by the pair of side plate portions <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> in such a manner as to bridge the pair of side plate portions <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>. The cam roller <b>28</b> is disposed between the pair of side plate portions <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>, and is rotatably supported by the pair of side plate portions <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> by means of the shaft member <b>27</b>. The other parallel link member <b>86</b> disposed between the side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and between the shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> has one end portion coupled rotatably to each of the side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> by means of a shaft member <b>100</b> and the other end portion coupled rotatably to each of the side plate portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> by means of a shaft member <b>96</b>. Thus, the shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> of the base <b>5</b>, the link body <b>92</b> of the parallel link member <b>85</b> and the parallel link member <b>86</b>, and the side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> constitute a parallel link mechanism <b>97</b> in which they are rotatably coupled to each other by means of the shaft members <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>100</b>, and <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With the holder unit <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, the receiving plate <b>19</b> is secured to the thick-walled portion of the base portion <b>87</b> by bolts, welding, or the like. When the upper die <b>4</b> is raised, the working tool holder <b>7</b> having the hemming punch <b>6</b> mounted on the front surface <b>35</b> of the holder body <b>22</b> resiliently abuts against end faces <b>99</b> of the shaft supporting portions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> at end faces <b>98</b> of the pair of side plate portions <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> by the resilient means <b>8</b> in which the spherical body <b>48</b> abuts against the receiving plate <b>19</b> with the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. When the cam roller <b>28</b> abuts against the inclined cam surface <b>61</b> on lowering of the upper die <b>4</b> in this state, the working tool holder <b>7</b> is moved in parallel while resisting the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> and being restrained by the parallel link mechanism <b>97</b> such that the end faces <b>98</b> are lowered relative to the end faces <b>99</b> while being moved away from the end faces <b>99</b>. As the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thus moved in parallel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the distal end portion <b>72</b> of the hemming punch <b>6</b> further bends the bent edge portion <b>71</b> of the unworked plate <b>11</b>. As the upper die <b>4</b> is further lowered, the cam roller <b>28</b> releases its abutment against the inclined cam surface <b>61</b> and abuts against the inclined cam surface <b>62</b>, whereupon the working tool holder <b>7</b> is moved in parallel such that the end faces <b>98</b> are raised relative to the end faces <b>99</b> while approaching the end faces <b>99</b>. As the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thus moved in parallel, the distal end portion <b>72</b> of the hemming punch <b>6</b> moves away from the bent edge portion <b>71</b> of the unworked plate <b>11</b>, and the bent edge portion <b>71</b> is provided with hemming in the same way as described above. After the hemming of the bent edge portion <b>71</b>, the upper die <b>4</b> is raised by the hydraulic ram or the like, and the working tool holder <b>7</b> is thereafter operated conversely to the above-described operation by the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>, and is returned, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>

Therefore, the application of the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> to the spherical body <b>48</b> can be decreased by loosening the fixation of the closure plate <b>46</b> to the holder body <b>22</b> or by removing the closure plate <b>46</b> from the holder body <b>22</b> by turning the screws <b>45</b>. Thus, the working tool holder <b>7</b>, which has been moved in parallel to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the nonworking position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, can be moved in parallel to dispose the hemming punch <b>6</b> to the working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> without being subjected to the large resistance due to the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b>. As a result, the resiliency of the coil spring <b>41</b> can be made small without removing the coil spring <b>41</b>, and it is possible to easily effect the initial adjustment and readjustment of the mutual position between the hemming punch <b>6</b> on the one hand, and the edge portion <b>13</b> of the lower die <b>3</b> and the upper blade <b>52</b> of the upper die <b>4</b> on the other hand. Furthermore, as a result of the fact that the coil spring <b>41</b> can be simply inserted into and withdrawn from the holder body <b>22</b> of the working tool holder <b>7</b>, the disassembly and reassembly can be performed easily.</p>
