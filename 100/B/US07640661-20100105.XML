<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL DOMAIN AND STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a process for manufacturing a metallic leading and/or trailing edge, designed for example to reinforce large code turbomachine fan blades.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Turbomachine fan blades undergo high mechanical stresses, particularly due to their rotation speed, while having to satisfy strict weight and size conditions. One of the options considered to reduce the weight of blades is to manufacture them from a composite material. However, turbomachine fan blades also have to satisfy severe usage criteria, particularly to resist impacts of foreign bodies. But the composite material, particularly on the edge of the blade, can break easily if it is very thin.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One means that has been considered for overcoming this problem is to consolidate the leading edge of fan blades made of a composite material by a metal part integrated into the aerodynamic profile of the blade. Such a metal reinforcing part, also called the consolidation leading edge or trailing edge, is then added, usually bonded, to the leading and/or trailing edge of the composite blade without altering its aerodynamic profile. This metal part is composed of a solid part several millimeters thick extended by two very thin lips (a few tenths of a millimeter thick) on its pressure surface and suction surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention is intended to make parts that could be used as a consolidation leading edge and/or a consolidation trailing edge for blades.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of the invention used to overcome problems inherent to the development of machining techniques to make a consolidation edge with a complex geometry, relates to a process for making a reinforcing leading edge and/or trailing edge including the manufacture of a hollow envelope and then cutting the envelope to obtain the required part. Preferably, the envelope is made using the &#x3c;&#x3c;diffusion bonding and super plastic forming&#x3e;&#x3e; technique, possibly including bending-twisting. Cutting is preferably done by laser or pressurized jet. It may be desirable to machine the edge thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the diffusion bonding and super plastic forming process for making parts with the shape of reinforcing edges, and more particularly consolidation trailing and/or leading edges for blades.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED PRESENTATION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a blade <b>1</b>, of the fan rotor blade type with a large chord. This type of blade has a complex geometry and comprises a root <b>2</b> prolonged by a tip <b>4</b> in a radial direction. The tip <b>4</b> that will be placed in the airflow circulation annulus of a turbomachine, is provided with two outer surfaces, called the suction surface <b>6</b> and the pressure surface <b>8</b>, connected by a leading edge <b>10</b> and a trailing edge <b>12</b>. Typically, the length between the leading edge <b>10</b> and the trailing edge <b>12</b> is of the order of 600 mm. Reinforcements <b>13</b> may be necessary on the trailing edge <b>12</b>, and particularly on the leading edge <b>10</b>, to prevent or simply retard their deterioration, particularly in the case of an impact.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These reinforcements <b>13</b> may be formed directly on the blade during its manufacture, for example by molding of metal. However, this solution is not always possible or even desirable, for example when two different materials are chosen for the blade and the reinforcement. In particular, in the case of blades made of a composite material, reinforcement of the leading edge and/or trailing edge made of metal, for example titanium alloy, will be made separately. This type of consolidation edge <b>14</b> is then added onto the blade <b>1</b>, matching its shape as close as possible so as to not modify its mechanical and aerodynamic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After seeing the geometry of the blade presented on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, it can quickly be deduced that the profile of the reinforcing edge <b>14</b> will also have a complex design. Furthermore, since the aerodynamic properties have to be maintained and the weight remains a constant concern, the required dimensions for the reinforcing edge <b>14</b> add additional constraints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows such a geometry for a consolidation leading and/or trailing edge <b>14</b> for a large code turbomachine fan blade, this blade being made of a composite material or other material. For example, the dimensions of such a reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b> could be a coverage length <b>1</b> of the order of 100 to 150 mm, preferably 130 mm, a height h of the solid part of the reinforcement of the order of 50 to 60 mm, and a wall thickness e of the lips less than 2 mm, if possible of the order of 0.5 mm, over most of its length (l&#x2212;h).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the invention, the choice for manufacturing such a complex profile is to use an intermediate product that a priori is more complex to make: an envelope <b>16</b> of the reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b>, which is generally hollow. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the envelope <b>16</b> comprises a periphery formed from the leading edge <b>14</b> and additional parts <b>18</b>, this periphery defining an inner cavity <b>20</b>. The advantage of defining such an envelope <b>16</b> is to use hollow parts manufacturing processes followed by cutting out the hollow part <b>16</b> to extract the reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, a manufacturing process is known and is described for example in document EP-A-1 338 353, for making complex hollow geometries, namely the SPF/DB&#x3c;&#x3c;Super Plastic Forming/Diffusion Bonding&#x3e;&#x3e; process used particularly in aeronautics.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first step consists of modeling the consolidation leading edge profile <b>14</b>, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, to obtain a part or envelope <b>16</b> that can be made by SPF/DB, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. One of the possibilities consists of using the computer assisted design (CAD) or modeling, for example by virtually cutting the leading edge <b>14</b> into transverse sections normal to a dummy longitudinal axis defined in the design. These sections are then modified so as to obtain closed internal sections and then combined to obtain a hollow envelope <b>16</b>. It is clear that other techniques known to those skilled in the art could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A so-called&#x3c;&#x3c;flattening&#x3e;&#x3e; operation then consists of flattening the pressure surface <b>22</b> and the suction surface <b>24</b> of this closed envelope <b>16</b> of the leading edge <b>14</b>, onto the same plane. This flattening operation may also be done by simulation, using CAD means, for example in three phases, deflation followed by detwisting and straightening then the real flattening. The design of the primary parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is deduced from this flattening, in a usual manner with two parts for this type of profile diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The primary parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> making up an edge are then machined, usually from a rolled or forged plate. The thickness of the plate may be equal to half the thickness of the consolidation leading or trailing edge to be manufactured; preferably, the plate is made of a titanium alloy, for example TiAlV, but any metal or alloy with properties satisfying the required use and that could be used with the SPF/DB technique, might be chosen. Different plates, or even variable thickness plates, could also be used for the pressure surface <b>22</b> and the suction surface <b>24</b>, for which the sum of the thicknesses is at least equal to or is greater than the maximum thickness of the reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b>. Machining consists of distributing the thicknesses of each primary part <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> making up the reinforcing leading or trailing edge according to the definition provided by CAD. Tools such as CAPM (computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing), and any technique known to those skilled in the art, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With the primary parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> thus machined, the next step is diffusion bonding so as to form the preform <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. For example, &#x3c;&#x3c;perfect&#x3e;&#x3e; cleaning of primary parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is done; the next step is the application of an anti-diffusion product on an internal face of at least the primary parts, according to a predefined pattern, for example by a silk-screen printing process. This anti-diffusion product is baked and the primary parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are assembled in a preform <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the parameters chosen for diffusion bonding for a consolidation leading edge <b>14</b> made of a titanium alloy for a large chord turbomachine fan blade <b>1</b> made of a composite material, could be as follows: temperature equal to 875&#xb0; C. to 940&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 3 to 6 MPa for at least one hour. Diffusion bonding may be done by applying mechanical or isostatic pressure on a press fitted with appropriate tooling; it is preferably made in a chamber for thermomechanical treatment under isostatic pressure, using an inert gas like argon, called an HIP (&#x3c;&#x3c;Hot Isostatic Pressure&#x3e;&#x3e;) chamber. The purpose of this operation is diffusion bonding of internal metal parts not coated with a diffusion product to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the diffusion bonding operation may be combined with shaping in the case of welding on press. The purpose of shaping is to improve positioning of the bonded preform on the inflation mould used for the inflation and super plastic forming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After diffusion bonding, a bending and twisting step can be carried out on the preform <b>30</b>. This step may also be combined with diffusion bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The preform <b>30</b> derived from diffusion bonding is then placed in inflation equipment so that super plastic forming is applied to it. For example, it can be done at between 850&#xb0; C. and 940&#xb0; C. at a pressure of between 2 and 6 MPa of argon. This step may be combined with diffusion bonding, possibly coupled to bending-twisting. The part derived from this process corresponds to the envelope <b>16</b> of the reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b> illustrated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>, and also shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note that up to this point, these steps are similar to the steps for manufacturing a hollow fan blade by SPF/DB, for which one example use is described in document FR-A-2 834 481: The process according to the invention also provides a means of reducing manufacturing costs for these sensitive parts of the blades, by the use of known tooling and existing know how.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally, the envelope <b>16</b> is cut-out to obtain a reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b> itself as shown diagrammatically on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d</i>. The cut-out may be done by any technique known to those skilled in the art; laser cutting and high pressure waterjet cutting are recommended.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It may be useful afterwards to do a finishing machining step, particularly polishing of the resulting edge <b>14</b>. Furthermore, in order to optimize the complementarity between the reinforcing leading edge <b>14</b> and the leading edge of the blade <b>10</b>; it may be preferable to adjust the dimensions. Generally, once made, the consolidation leading edge <b>14</b> can be machined according to any technique known to those skilled in the art, and particularly chemical and/or mechanical machining could be considered to decrease the thickness of the pressure surface and the suction surface.</p>
