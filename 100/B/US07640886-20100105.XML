<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to lubricant coatings for hard disks for hard disk drives, and more particularly to devices and methods to suppress surface waves in a disk lubricant dipping tank.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hard disks that are utilized in hard disk drives are typically coated with a thin lubrication film to protect the surface of the disk during usage. A common method for applying the lubrication film to the disks is by use of a lubrication tank in which the disks are submerged in a lubricant bath and slowly withdrawn from the bath. It is desirable that the thin lubrication film form a single uniform film coating on the surface of the disk for optimum disk drive performance at the disk magnetic head interface. However, it has been found that unwanted variations in the thickness of the thin lubricant film are typically created when the lubricant film is applied utilizing the disk dipping tank method.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A reason for the creation of unwanted multiple layers of lubricant upon portions of the disk surface is the existence of small surface waves within the lubricant bath as the disks are removed from the bath. These surface waves cause the meniscus at the intersection of the disk surface with the lubricant bath surface to rise and fall. With each such rising and falling of the meniscus a thickened lubricant line is applied to the surface of the disk. The lubricant is dispersed in a highly volatile carrier fluid which rapidly evaporates from the surface of the disk, such that the thickened lubricant line from the surface wave remains upon the disk surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a solution to this problem by minimizing the surface waves of the lubricant bath to create a more uniform lubricant coating upon the disk surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disk lubricant tank of the present invention includes a lubricant bath cover device that resides on the lubricant bath surface to suppress surface waves. The bath cover includes a plurality of finger-like projecting members that define a plurality of disk passage slots therebetween. A plurality of disks are disposed upon a disk holding mandrel and are lowered into the lubricant bath. Each disk passes through a separate disk passage slot during the dipping process. The finger-like projections reside on the bath surface between the disk to suppress surface waves that would otherwise impinge upon side surfaces of the disk, leading to unwanted lubricant overcoat areas upon the side surfaces of the disk. Therefore, hard disks of the present invention are formed with a more uniform lubricant coating wherein unwanted lubricant overcoat areas formed by surface waves in the lubricant bath are suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an advantage of the disk lubricant bath device of the present invention that hard disks are manufactured with a more uniform lubricant coating.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another advantage of the lubricant bath device of the present invention that surface waves within the lubricant bath are suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further advantage of the lubricant bath device of the present invention that a bath cover device is provided which floats on the surface of the lubricant bath to adjust to differing lubricant bath levels.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an advantage of a hard disk of the present invention that it is manufactured with a more uniform lubricant coating.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description which makes reference to the several figures of the drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As is well known to those skilled in the art, hard disks for use in hard disk drives are coated with a thin lubrication film to protect the surface of the hard disk during hard disk drive operation. This protection is necessary where the magnetic head of the hard disk drive floats on an air bearing just a few microns above surface of the disk. Where the magnetic head, for various reasons, makes unwanted contact with the hard disk, the lubricant coating serves to minimize damage to both the hard disk surface and the surface of the magnetic head. The application upon the disk surface of a lubricant film having a uniform thickness is therefore desirable, particularly as the air bearing gap of more advanced hard disk drives is generally decreasing. However, as is next described, prior art lubricant film application techniques, specifically utilizing a lubricant tank into which the hard disks are dipped, results in a lubricant film having unwanted thickness variations. As is further described herebelow, the present invention seeks to eliminate the lubricant film thickness variations that have previously resulted from the use of a disk dipping lubrication tank.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a typical prior art lubrication tank for the dipping of hard disks therewithin, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the disk lubrication tank depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, taken along lines <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front plan view of a prior art hard disk where the variations in lubricant thickness are depicted as horizontal lines. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a typical disk lubrication tank <b>10</b> is a generally rectangular walled container that is typically formed of stainless steel. A lubricant bath <b>14</b> is disposed within the tank <b>10</b>, and the bath liquid is typically composed of the disk lubricant dissolved in a highly volatile carrier fluid. The disks <b>18</b> to be dipped into the bath <b>14</b> are oriented vertically upon a notched mandrel <b>22</b> that projects through the central opening <b>24</b> of each disk. The mandrel <b>22</b> is lowered into the bath <b>14</b>, such that the disks <b>18</b> are all submerged in the bath <b>14</b>, and then raised to remove all of the now lubricant solution coated disks from the bath. The volatile carrier fluid rapidly evaporates, leaving a thin lubricant film on the surfaces of the disk <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Focusing next on the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of disks <b>18</b> are shown emerging from the lubricant bath <b>14</b>. It is to be understood that all of the disks <b>18</b> have been previously fully submerged into the lubricant bath <b>14</b> and are depicted at a point during the raising of the mandrel <b>22</b> with the disks <b>18</b> mounted thereon. Initially, it is seen that the mandrel is disposed at an angle with respect to the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath <b>14</b>. As a result, each of the individual disks <b>18</b> emerges from the surface <b>26</b> of the bath at a separate time. A particular depiction of the problem created by capillary surface waves is shown with regard to disk <b>34</b> which is depicted in the instant before the bottom edge <b>38</b> of the disk <b>34</b> is removed from the lubricant bath <b>14</b>. As can be seen, due to the capillary effect between the liquid and the disk, a small portion <b>46</b> of the liquid meniscus is drawn upwardly from the nominal surface <b>26</b> of the bath in continued contact with the bottom edge <b>38</b> of the disk <b>34</b>. A moment later (not depicted), as the mandrel <b>22</b> rises further in removing the disks <b>18</b> from the bath, the upraised portions <b>46</b> of the lubricant meniscus will release from the bottom edge <b>38</b> of the disk <b>34</b> and fall back into the bath <b>14</b>, thereby creating a small surface waves <b>50</b>, termed capillary waves, across the surface <b>26</b> of the bath <b>14</b>. These capillary waves <b>50</b> will strike the surfaces <b>54</b> of the disks that remain within the lubricant bath <b>14</b>, and the small capillary surface waves <b>50</b> will create small additional lubricant coating areas as the lubricant meniscus of the waves <b>50</b> in contact with the disk surface <b>54</b> moves up and down. Immediately thereafter, the volatile carrier component of the lubricant bath evaporates from the surface <b>54</b> of the disk, leaving unwanted additional lubricant layer areas upon the surface <b>54</b> of the disk where the capillary wave <b>50</b> struck the disk <b>18</b>. Because the surface of the lubricant bath generally strikes the surface <b>54</b> of the disk in a horizontal line <b>62</b>, the unwanted lubricant overcoatings appear on the surface of the disk in horizontal lines, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and discussed herebelow. It is therefore to be understood that as each of the disks <b>18</b> emerges from the lubricant bath, capillary surface waves <b>50</b> are created which travel across the surface <b>26</b> of the bath and strike the disk surfaces <b>54</b> of remaining disks to create unwanted layerings of lubricant <b>62</b> upon the remaining disks, leading to an uneven lubricant coating upon the surface <b>54</b> of the disk <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a prior art hard disk <b>64</b> having an uneven lubricant coating as a result of unwanted surface waves within the lubricant tank. Particularly, the uneven lubricant coating areas are shown as horizontal lines <b>62</b> across the surface <b>54</b> of the disk <b>64</b>, which correspond to multiple thicknesses of lubricant that were deposited by surface waves <b>50</b> as the disk <b>64</b> was removed in the vertical direction (arrow <b>66</b>) from the lubricant bath.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general terms, the present invention includes a device which acts as a surface wave barrier that is disposed at the surface of the lubricant tank between adjacent disks to interrupt surface waves. A perspective view of a surface wave interrupting device <b>100</b> of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and a cross-sectional view of the surface wave interrupting device <b>100</b> as disposed within a disk lubricant tank <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; a hard disk <b>110</b> of the present invention with a more uniform lubricant coating is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a surface wave interrupting device <b>100</b> of the present invention can take the form of a lubricant bath cover that is preferably though not necessarily designed to float on the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath. The bath cover device is generally, though not necessarily, rectangular to substantially match the shape of the rectangular tank <b>10</b>. The bath cover <b>100</b> is an integrally formed member including a central mandrel passage slot <b>114</b> for the passage of the mandrel <b>22</b> therethrough and a plurality of individual disk passage slots <b>118</b> for the passage of the individual disks <b>18</b> therethrough when the bath cover is disposed upon the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath <b>14</b>. The disk passage slots <b>118</b> are generally perpendicular to the central mandrel passage slot <b>114</b>. The bath cover can therefore be thought of as having a plurality of finger-like projecting members <b>122</b> that project from the side portions <b>126</b> of the bath cover <b>100</b> into locations between adjacent pairs of hard disks.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be seen that the finger-like projecting members <b>122</b> of the bath cover that define the disk slots <b>118</b> are disposed upon the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath <b>14</b> between each of two adjacent disks <b>18</b>. A hard disk <b>134</b> is shown emerging from the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath <b>14</b>, such that the liquid capillary action draws the liquid meniscus <b>138</b> upward in contact with the bottom edge <b>142</b> of the disk <b>134</b>. Thereafter, as the mandrel <b>22</b> is raised upwards (not shown), the bottom edge <b>142</b> of the disk breaks contact with the liquid <b>14</b> and the liquid meniscus <b>138</b> falls back to the surface <b>26</b> of the bath <b>14</b>, and surface capillary waves will be created. However, the finger-like projections <b>122</b> of the bath cover act to intercept and suppress the surface waves, such that the waves cannot reach the adjacent disk <b>18</b>, nor any of the other disks <b>18</b> that are still in contact with the lubricant bath <b>14</b>. As a result, the surface waves created by each of the disks <b>18</b> as they emerge from the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath <b>14</b> do not travel across the surface <b>26</b> of the lubricant bath to impinge upon the sides <b>54</b> of the disks <b>18</b> that remain within the bath. The bath cover <b>100</b> thus serves to suppress these surface waves, whereby disks <b>18</b> emerge from the lubricant bath without the uneven lubricant thickness horizontal lines <b>62</b> of the prior art disk <b>64</b>. A hard disk <b>110</b> of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in which the surface wave created lubricant thickness lines substantially do not exist. Thus the hard disks <b>110</b> of the present invention have a generally uniform thin film lubricant layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is preferable that the bath cover <b>100</b> be comprised of a material that will not contaminate the lubricant nor form particulates that may become resident upon the disk surfaces. Suitable materials are stainless steel and Teflon, although the invention is not to be so limited. It is desirable that the bath cover <b>100</b> be held stationary within the tank such that the dipping of the disks is reliably conducted without the disks making solid-solid contact with the bath cover fingers <b>122</b> that are disposed between the disks <b>18</b>. It is also desirable that the bath cover <b>100</b> be vibrationally isolated from the tank walls <b>10</b>, such that external vibrations that are transmitted to the tank walls, are not transmitted to the bath cover. The bath cover <b>100</b> can then act to intercept surface waves from the tank walls <b>10</b> that might otherwise impinge upon the disk surfaces to create the unwanted multiple layering of lubricant upon the disk surfaces. The bath cover of the present invention may be further improved, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by modifying the edge surfaces of the finger-like projections <b>122</b> to be non-reflective of surface waves that may occur. Specifically, the edges <b>180</b> may be irregularly shaped <b>184</b> (rather than smooth and flat) and/or, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, they may be formed of a porous material <b>188</b> that is absorbent of surface waves that strike the porous surface <b>188</b>, such that the surface waves are not reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the present invention has been shown and described with regard to certain preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications in form and detail will no doubt be developed by those skilled in the art upon reviewing this disclosure. It is therefore intended that the following claims cover all such alterations and modifications that nevertheless include the true spirit and scope of the inventive features of the present invention.</p>
