<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such trucks have become known e.g. from U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,144, U.S. Pat. No. 6,595,306 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,313. On one end the body of the truck has a load carrying means, e.g. a load carrying fork. The truck body includes a lift drive for the load carrying fork and driving means for the truck. The steering of the truck takes place through a steering arm which is linked to the upper side of the truck body. With the free end the steering arm carries a head wherein various control elements for individual functions of the truck are arranged. At the front side the truck body is provided with a platform which can be used for the driver in order to ride with the truck. In this position the driver seizes a hand rail which is conversely U-shaped and mounted on the top of the truck body. The hand rail has two spaced approximately parallel vertical legs, and a hand rod or grab bar connected to the upper end of the vertical legs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the known walkie/rider trucks it has also become known to mount a control panel to the grab bar. From U.S. Pat. No. 6,595,306 it has become known to accommodate a plurality of control elements within a housing for such panel, preferably control elements for the lifting and lowering of the fork for the actuation of the horn and for the switching into a fast speed mode. The control elements or buttons are arranged in a control field which faces forwardly, i.e. towards the driver on the platform. From the prior art mentioned, it has further become known to arrange a further control element on the rear side of the control panel or housing e.g. for the actuation of the coast mode. In some uses the driver or operator prefers to let the truck freely roll further with small speed if he is still at a remote position. By this, the truck can be sent to a position where an operation is desired. Due to his experience, the operator can estimate how far the truck rolls on if he actuates this function at a predetermined speed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to provide a hand rail for a walkie/rider truck wherein the control panel is designed such or placed, respectively, that the operator can seize the grab bar of the hand rail at different positions also adjacent the control panel in order to actuate the control elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the hand rail according to the invention, the housing of the control panel is located at the lower side of the grab bar such and the grab bar in the area of the housing is formed such that the grab bar can be gripped or seized above the control panel or the control housing by the hand of the operator in order to actuate a control element and/or to hold fast.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The hand rail according to the invention allows a secure gripping position of the hand under different driving conditions i.e. travel in the direction of the steering arm, travel in the direction of the load carrying fork, actuation of the fast speed mode button, actuation of the horn, actuation of the control elements for lifting and lowering. With the hand rail according to the invention, the hand may slide along the grab bar from one end to the other without the necessity to release the grab bar.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a particular preferred embodiment of the invention it is provided that the box-shaped control housing extends obliquely forwards. An inclined arrangement of the control housing is already known by the mentioned prior art. According to the invention the grab bar above the control housing has a bead-shaped thickening in cross-section which extends rewardly and which can be undergripped by the fingers of the hand seizing the grab bar. The bead allows that the finger may undergrip the bead while the thumb rests against the front side of the grab bar. The operator may hold fast on the grab bar if his hand is approximately in the centre of the grab bar above the control housing or box. In this gripping position an actuation of a control element can be carried out with a finger or the thumb.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment of the invention the legs of the hand rail are bent forward with the upper ends thereof. With an inclined arrangement of the box-shaped control housing the bent portions of the legs include a right angle with the plane wherein the control housing extends with the plane having an angle of about 45&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; relative to a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further embodiment of the invention, the lower ends of the legs can be interconnected by a transverse web or rail which may be attached to the upper side of the truck body. Such an attachment can for example be carried out by threaded means. In this manner, a secure connection of the hand rail to the truck body is achieved. The upper side of the transverse web can be shaped as an elongated cup for the accommodation of articles. The hand rail including the transverse web can be made of metallic material in order to achieve a sufficient stability. Preferably, the metallic parts are coated with a plastic layer in order to avoid injuries. The cup is preferably made of soft plastic material in order to avoid a rattling of the accommodated articles during travel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bead-shaped thickening is also preferably of plastic material. It is preferably shaped to a tube of the grab bar. The bead can be integrally formed with the control housing which may include a recess for the receipt of a control box which is inserted into the box. The control or switch box with the control elements may be pre-manufactured completely with only control or signal cables lead out of the box which are accommodated by the hollow grab bar and at least one leg of the hand rail and introduced into the truck body.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Like the prior art in the invention, the control housing or the switch box has a control panel or field. In an embodiment of the invention the control elements for the lifting and lowering of the load carrying fork are on the left or right end of the control panel with the control elements being electrically or mechanically coupled. Thus, it depends upon the position of the operator on the platform or of the hand which grasps the grab bar whether the operator actuates the control elements on the left or the right side of the control panel if he wishes a lifting or lowering function. Control elements for the fast speed mode and the horn which are preferably positioned one above the other, can be arranged between the control elements on the left and the right end.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Alternatively, it is also possible to position a control element for the lifting and the lowering one above the other approximately in the centre of the control panel while at the left and the right end thereof control elements for the fast speed mode and the horn are arranged which preferably are electrically or mechanically coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the hand rail according to the invention at least one control element can be located on the rear side of the control housing or box, e.g. a control element for the coasting of the truck.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While this invention may be embodied in many different forms, there are described in detail herein a specific preferred embodiment of the invention. This description is an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiment illustrated</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a walkie/rider truck <b>10</b> is perspectively shown and for example has become known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,382,359 B1. It comprises a truck body <b>12</b> with a platform <b>14</b> mounted to the front side of the body for an operator. A steering arm <b>16</b> is linked to the upper side of the truck body <b>10</b>. The steering arm has a rod <b>18</b> and a steering head <b>20</b>. The rod <b>18</b> is pivotably supported on the upper side of body <b>12</b> about a horizontal axis. Furthermore, it can be rotated about a vertical axis for the steering operation of the steered wheel of truck <b>10</b>, not shown. A conversely U-shaped hand rail <b>24</b> is mounted on the top of truck body <b>12</b>. The operator may seize the hand rail if he stands on platform <b>14</b>. He may stand on the left or the right side of platform <b>14</b> depending upon whether he is left or right handed. If he stands on the right side, he seizes with his right hand hand rail <b>24</b> and actuates the steering arm <b>16</b> with his left hand. If he stands on the left side of platform <b>14</b>, it is vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At the rear side a load carrying means in form of a load carrying fork is located which can be recognized by a fork arm <b>26</b>. It carries a pallet <b>28</b> upon which load <b>30</b> is placed. A battery <b>32</b> is located between the load carrying means and the truck body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A control housing <b>34</b> is mounted to the grab bar of the hand rail <b>24</b> which includes individual control elements e.g. buttons to actuate a lifting or lowering of the load carrying fork, to actuate the horn or the coast mode. In the further figures it is exclusively referred to a hand rail modified with respect to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and with a modified control housing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and <b>6</b> to <b>19</b> a hand rail <b>40</b> is shown having a function similar to the function of hand rail <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the following the structure of hand rail <b>40</b> should be explained. It includes two parallel vertical spaced legs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> which taper upwards. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> or <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, respectively, an upper portion <b>46</b> of legs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> is bent forwardly i.e. towards the operator or the platform, respectively (see platform <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The portion <b>46</b> extends proximately under an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the vertical. The upper ends of portion <b>46</b> of both legs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are interconnected by a grab bar <b>48</b>. The lower ends of legs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are interconnected by a transverse web or rail. An elongated cup <b>52</b> is formed at the upper side of transverse web <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The structure of hand rail <b>40</b> can particularly be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> and <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref> it can be seen that the grab bar has a grab tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>which at the ends is connected with metallic supports or tubular sections or the like which cannot be seen. These supports are connected with a rail <b>54</b> at the lower end which at the lower side has four threaded bolts <b>56</b> which co-act with nuts <b>58</b> in order to attach the transverse web <b>50</b> of hand rail <b>40</b> in a suitable manner to the upper side of the housing or the body of the truck. This attachment is not shown in detail. The described metallic parts of hand rail <b>40</b> are coated with plastic material with the coating of the rail <b>54</b> forming the cup. It is of relatively soft material in order to avoid a rattling of the articles in the cup <b>52</b> during travel. The coating of tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>is carried out in a specific manner. In the medium area of tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>an elongated bead <b>60</b> is shaped with in cross-section is obliquely and downwardly directed to the rear. It is positioned such that the finger of a hand (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) which seizes the grab bar <b>40</b>, may undergrip bead <b>60</b>. A switch housing <b>62</b> is integrally formed with bead <b>60</b> which extends obliquely downwardly and forwardly approximately at an angle of 30&#xb0; to the vertical. Opposite to bead <b>60</b> a somewhat smaller bead <b>64</b> is shaped to tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>which may be engaged by the thumb of the hand undergripping bead <b>60</b>. The bead <b>64</b> is above the control housing <b>62</b>. The control housing <b>62</b> is approximately box-shaped and has an inclined upwardly directed rectangular recess <b>66</b> which may accommodate a switch box <b>68</b> fitted to the recess. In the range of recess <b>66</b> of the control housing <b>62</b> the plastic material of the housing is enforced by a support sheet <b>70</b> L-shaped in cross-section. The support sheet <b>70</b> is welded to tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>with its upper edge. At <b>77</b> an opening for the draining of water at the lower side of the bottom of recess <b>66</b> is shown. A passage <b>74</b> in housing <b>62</b> interconnects recess <b>66</b> with tube <b>52</b><i>a</i>. The passage <b>74</b> serves for the accommodation of cables which are introduced into the interior of tube <b>52</b><i>a </i>and which are led through one of the legs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> downwardly into the interior of the truck body. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at <b>76</b> the lower opening of the cable passage in leg <b>44</b> can be seen.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The switch box <b>68</b> is substantially square-shaped and at the rear side has an elevation <b>78</b> which accommodates a rectangular button <b>80</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> holes <b>62</b>, <b>68</b> on both sides of button <b>80</b> are arranged for a threaded connection of the switch box <b>68</b> and within recess <b>66</b> of housing <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch box <b>68</b> has a control or a button panel with a left switch rocker <b>86</b>, a right switch rocker <b>88</b> and an medium switch rocker <b>90</b>. The switch rockers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are pivotably supported about a horizontal axis. They can be pushed downwards at the upper and the lower end in order to actuate a function of the truck not shown. In the centre area of switch rocker <b>90</b> a signal indicator <b>92</b> is shown. It can for example indicate a predetermined mode upon actuation of a function of the truck. The switches associated with the switch rockers <b>86</b> to <b>90</b> in switch box <b>68</b> can work in an analogous or digital manner. As can be seen, the actuation surfaces of the switch rockers <b>86</b> to <b>90</b> fill out the control panel of switch box <b>68</b> completely. It is of course conceivable to provide six control buttons instead of three rockers which are located by pairs one above the other so that three pairs of control buttons form the control panel of switch box <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the control panel of switch box <b>18</b> is shown in enlarged scale. It can be recognized from the symbols that the outer switch rockers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are for the lifting and lowering of the load carrying fork. The switch rockers <b>86</b>,<b>88</b> can be mechanically or electrically coupled so that it is the same whether the left or the right switch rocker <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> is actuated for the lifting or lowering function. Upon actuation of the upper part of the medium switch rocker <b>90</b> the fast speed mode is switched on while upon actuation of the lower part of switch rocker <b>90</b> the horn is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the arrangement of the switch rockers is changed relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The outer switch rockers <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>88</b><i>a </i>serve for the actuation of the fast speed mode and the horn as indicated by the symbols. The medium switch rocker <b>90</b><i>a </i>serves for the lifting and lowering of the load carrying fork as indicated by the symbols. The outer switch rockers <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>88</b><i>a </i>can be mechanically or electrically coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 19</figref> different gripping positions on the hand rail <b>40</b> or the gripping bar <b>48</b>, respectively, are depicted. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> the hand seizes the right portion of grab bar <b>68</b> with the fingers of the hand approximately completely gripping around the grab bar <b>48</b> while the thumb actuates the right switch rocker <b>68</b>. The index finger of the hand lies adjacent to control housing <b>62</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>19</b> the bead <b>60</b> extends approximately beyond both sides of control housing <b>62</b> and changes over to the contour of the grab bar <b>68</b> circular in cross-section. The same is valid for the front bead <b>64</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> the right hand of the operator seizes the grab bar <b>48</b> in the area of control housing <b>62</b> with the fingers undergrip bead <b>60</b> and the thumb actuates the left switch rocker <b>86</b>. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> the right hand of the operator seizes grab rod <b>48</b> approximately centrally without actuating a switch rocker. The thumb engages the front bead <b>64</b>, and the fingers undergrip the rear bead <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> the right hand of the operator seizes the grab bar <b>48</b> approximately centrally with the thumb actuating the central switch rocker <b>90</b>. The fingers undergrip bead <b>60</b> at the rear side.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> the right hand of the operator seizes the grab bar <b>48</b> approximately centrally with the thumb engaging the front side of grab bar <b>48</b> or the fingers undergrip bead <b>60</b> and one finger actuates the rear button <b>80</b>. The gripping positions according <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> can be also seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, and the gripping position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> are again depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">From the figures it can be seen that the arrangement of the control housing <b>62</b> on the lower side of the grab bar <b>48</b> offers the possibility to seize the grab bar <b>48</b> on each position between its ends. If the grab bar is seized on both sides of control housing <b>62</b>, the grab bar circular in cross-section is approximately completely spanned while seizing in an intermediate position the fingers may grip under bead <b>60</b> in order to achieve a sufficient support also in this position. Furthermore, in this gripping position the switch rockers <b>86</b> to <b>90</b> and button <b>80</b> may be actuated. It is not necessary that the operator releases grab bar <b>48</b> in order to perform a switch actuation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The control housing is integrally formed with the plastic envelope of the hand rail <b>40</b> and allows a simple mounting of the switch box with a suitable control panel. The rear button <b>80</b> for example serves to actuate the coast mode. It is understood that also further control elements can be located at the rear side of the control housing <b>62</b>. The signal indicator <b>92</b> is e.g. for the indication of the coast mode.</p>
