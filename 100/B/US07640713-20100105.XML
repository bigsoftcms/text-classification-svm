No. 7,520,107, which is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/952,421, filed Sep. 28, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,237,369, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/508,609 filed Oct. 3, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/579,846 filed Jun. 15, 2004, the contents of each is hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to apparatus that can package and apply closure clips to materials that enclose products therein, and may be particularly suitable for clipping netting material.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain types of commodity and/or industrial items can be packaged by placing the desired product(s) in a covering material and then applying a closure clip or clips to end portions of the covering material to secure the product(s) therein. For non-flowable piece goods, the piece goods can be held individually in a respective clipped package, or as a group of goods in a single package. The covering material can be any suitable material, typically a casing and/or netting material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally described, when packaging a piece good product in netting, the product is manually pushed through a netting chute. The product can include, by way of example, a non-flowable semi-solid and/or solid object such as a meat product including whole or half hams, turkey, chicken, and the like. The netting chute holds a length of a netting sleeve over the exterior thereof. A first downstream end portion of the netting is typically closed using a first clip. As the product exits the netting chute, it is covered with the netting. An operator can then orient the product inside the netting between the discharge end of the chute and the clipped first end portion of the netting. The operator can then pull the netting so that the netting is held relatively tight (typically stretched or in tension) over the product. The operator then uses his/her hands to compress or gather the open end of the netting (upstream of the product) and manually applies a clip to the netting, typically using a Tipper Tie&#xae; double clipper apparatus. A clip attachment apparatus or &#x201c;clippers&#x201d; are well known to those of skill in the art and include those available from Tipper Tie, Inc., of Apex, N.C., including product numbers Z3214, Z3202, and Z3200. Examples of clip attachment apparatus and/or packaging apparatus are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,389,533; 3,499,259; 4,683,700; and 5,161,347, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The double clipper concurrently applies two clips to the netting proximate the open (upstream) end of the package. One clip defines the first end portion of the next package and the other defines the trailing or second end portion of the package then being closed. A cutting mechanism incorporated in the clipper apparatus can sever the two packages before the enclosed package is removed from the clipper apparatus. U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,713 describes a double clipper apparatus used to apply two clips to a casing covering. U.S. Pat. No. 5,495,701 proposes a clipper with a clip attachment mechanism configured to selectively fasten a single clip or two clips simultaneously. The mechanism has two punches, one of which is driven directly by a pneumatic cylinder and the other of which is connected to the first punch using a pin and key assembly. The pin and key assembly allows the punches to be coupled or decoupled to the pneumatic cylinder drive to apply one single clip or two clips simultaneously, U.S. Pat. No. 5,586,424 proposes an apparatus for movement of U-shaped clips along a rail. The apparatus includes a clip feed for advancing clips on a guide rail and the arm is reciprocally driven by a piston and cylinder arrangement. The contents of each of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other devices provide for semi-automated or automated clipping as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/339,910 and co-assigned, co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/508,659, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/339,910 describes a device with a chute that is configured to package a product, such as a vacuum-packed turkey, and can also form a handle in a tubular covering encasing the product.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide apparatus, subassemblies and/or other devices, systems, methods and computer program products for packaging a product in a covering material and/or applying clips thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the product can be manipulated and packaged so that at least one clip is automatically applied to enclose the product in the covering material. Particular embodiments automatically package a discrete object or objects in netting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain embodiments are directed to systems for enclosing at least one product in a covering material. The systems include: (a) an elongate product chute having an outer surface and opposing receiving and discharge end portions with an interior cavity extending therethrough; (b) a product pusher mechanism that is configured to controllably automatically advance into and retract from the product chute to thereby advance a product through the product chute and out of the discharge end portion of the product chute; (c) a clipper mechanism disposed downstream of the product chute in cooperating alignment therewith, the clipper mechanism configured to apply at least one clip to a covering material that encloses the product after the product exits the product chute; and (d) a cutting member disposed downstream of the product chute, the cutting member configured to cooperate with the clipper mechanism to, in operation, automatically travel generally upwardly to sever adjacent portions of covering material from an underside to top side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments the system can include a handle maker in communication with the covering material and disposed downstream of the product chute proximate the clipper mechanism. In certain embodiments, the clipper mechanism travels from the first position to the second position while the handle maker is forming a handle to thereby reduce clip cycle time.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the system includes a modular mounting frame, wherein the handle maker and the clipper mechanism are configured to be selectively mounted to either a right or left hand side of the modular mounting frame and align to a desired operating position (independent of which side the mechanism or handle maker are mounted on). The clipper mechanism and handle maker are typically configured to reside on opposing sides of the mounting frame.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other embodiments, methods of cutting or severing adjacent portions of a covering material having two longitudinally spaced apart sealed portions held in tension, include: (a) automatically raising a knife from a position below two longitudinally spaced apart sealed portions of covering material; and (b) severing the covering material between the two longitudinally sealed portions in a bottom to top order, responsive to raising the knife.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The covering material can comprise netting. In particular embodiments, the method also includes: applying two longitudinally spaced apart clips to netting material to form the spaced apart sealed portions, one clip defining a trailing edge portion of a packaged product wrapped in the netting and the other clip defining a leading edge portion of another package; and automatically moving the knife to a home position after the severing step. The severing and moving steps can release the packaged product to allow the packaged product to travel downstream past the knife.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the applying step includes automatically pivoting a clipper mechanism into an operative position, the method further comprising automatically gathering the netting material prior to the applying step, wherein the knife is attached to the clipper mechanism and pivots with the clipper mechanism to reside below the netting prior to the severing step.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still other embodiments are directed to methods of shaping a food product. The methods include: (a) automatically pushing at least one object through a product chute using an actuator driven pusher mechanism, the product chute sized and configured to compress a food product as the food product moves through the product chute with sufficient force to cause the food product to have a desired shape as the food product exits the product chute; (b) pulling netting material off an exterior surface of the product chute to automatically enclose the object in the netting material as the object exits the product chute; and then (c) applying at least one clip to the netting material to secure the object in the netting material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pushing can include automatically extending a pusher head into the product chute to contact the object and force the object through the product chute and then retracting the pusher head from the product chute. The applying a clip may include automatically gathering the covering material together and applying at least one clip to the gathered covering material. In particular embodiments, the applying step can include applying two proximately positioned but longitudinally spaced apart clips substantially concurrently to the gathered covering material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the gathered covering material is netting that wraps about a bone-in, semi, half or whole ham.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other embodiments are directed to clipper assemblies. The assemblies include: (a) a clipper mechanism having a clipper body configured to deliver clips to a clip window and attach the clips to a gathered portion of casing material, the clipper mechanism having an automated stroke cycle that includes a retracted home position and a laterally extended full-clip position; and (b) a cutting member attached to a lower portion of the clipper mechanism, wherein the cutting member travels with the clipper mechanism during the automated stroke cycle, and wherein, in operation, the cutting member is configured to travel generally upwardly to sever a gathered casing material from a bottom to top portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cutting member may be automatically actuated to rise to sever the gathered casing material after (but proximate in time to when) at least one clip is applied to the gathered casing material. The automated stroke cycle until clip position can be such that the clip window is generally aligned with an axial centerline of a product travel path (typically defined by the axial centerline of a product chute upstream of the cutting member).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular embodiments, the clipper assemblies may also include a proximity sensor mounted to the cartridge to provide data to control the timing of the actuation of the cylinder to automatically controllably advance the cutting member (that may be configured as a generally planar knife blade) to sever the netting. The clipper can include spaced apart gathering plates with a first gathering plate disposed downstream of a second gathering plate. The first gathering plate can include a cutting member guide channel that is sized and configured to slidably receive the cutting member therein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some embodiments are directed to automatic pivotable clipper mechanisms for attaching closure clips to product held in a covering material. The mechanisms include: (a) a clipper body; (b) a curvilinear clip rail attached to the clipper body having opposing top and bottom end portions and defining a generally downwardly extending clip feed direction; (c) a clip entry window in communication with the bottom end portion of the clip rail and a clip closure delivery path in communication with a punch mechanism that is adapted to wrap a clip from the clip rail about a target work piece; (d) a first clip pusher configured to selectively engage with clips held on the clip rail to force the clips in the feed direction; (e) a first clipper gathering plate attached to the clipper body on a first side of the clip entry window, the first clipper gathering plate configured to extend a distance below the clip rail and generally outwardly therefrom toward a target covering material; (f) a second clipper gathering plate attached to the clipper body on an opposing side of the clip entry window downstream of the first clipper gathering plate so as to be spaced apart from the first clipper gathering plate, the second clipper gathering plate configured to extend a distance below the clip rail and generally outwardly therefrom toward the target covering material; and (g) a cutting member attached to a lower portion of the clipper body. In operation, the cutting member cuts from bottom to top and the clipper mechanism pivots from a rest position to an active clipping position and the first and second clipper gathering plates and cutting member move generally in concert with the clipper mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still other embodiments are directed to product pusher assemblies for pushing product through a product chute that dispenses covering material from an outer surface thereof. The assemblies include: a pusher head having a forward portion with a pin extending outwardly therefrom, the pusher head configured and sized to enter into the product chute and push an object undergoing packaging through the product chute; and a pusher actuation cylinder attached to the pusher head assembly to direct the pusher head assembly to automatically and controllably repetitively travel back and forth between a downstream position and an upstream position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Yet other embodiments are directed to computer program products for operating a clipper mechanism. The computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied in the medium. The computer-readable program code including computer readable program code that controllably actuates a knife actuation cylinder to direct the knife to rise up to cut from a bottom to top direction and then retracts the knife.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The computer program product can also include computer readable program code that automatically controllably actuates an automated handle maker to generate a handle from netting and/or computer readable program code that allows a user to select left hand or right hand operation of either the clipping mechanism and/or the handle maker (where operational sequence or direction is different based on the mounting configuration).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other embodiments the same program control sequence can be used to operate the right or left handed operation of either or both of the handle maker and/or clipping mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">These and other objects and/or aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the specification set forth below.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. In the figures, certain layers, components or features may be exaggerated for clarity, and broken lines illustrate optional features or operations, unless specified otherwise. In addition, the sequence of operations (or steps) is not limited to the order presented in the claims unless specifically indicated otherwise. Where used, the terms &#x201c;attached&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, &#x201c;contacting&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; and the like, can mean either directly or indirectly, unless stated otherwise. The term &#x201c;concurrently&#x201d; means that the operations are carried out substantially simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the description of the present invention that follows, certain terms are employed to refer to the positional relationship of certain structures relative to other structures. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;forward&#x201d; and derivatives thereof refer to the general or primary direction that a target product travels for enclosure and/or clipping; this term is intended to be synonymous with the term &#x201c;downstream,&#x201d; which is often used in manufacturing or material flow environments to indicate that certain material traveling or being acted upon is farther along in that process than other material. Conversely, the terms &#x201c;rearward,&#x201d; &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and derivatives thereof refer to the directions opposite, respectively, the forward and downstream directions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and should not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; means a generally skeletal structure used to support one or more assemblies, modules and/or components. The term &#x201c;modular&#x201d; means that a subassembly is designed with standardized dimensions, mounting features and/or configurations for interchangeable use with replacement modules of the same or similar type and/or other selected different modules. The frame and selected modules may also be configured for selectable mounting on a right or left hand side of a common frame.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Embodiments of the present invention provide modules <b>40</b><i>m </i>configured with a frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) that allows a clipper <b>40</b> to mount to either the right or left hand side (<b>40</b>R, <b>40</b>L respectively) of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>and/or to allow the selective assembly of a handle maker <b>60</b> (as shown by the module <b>40</b><i>m </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or not (shown by the module <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>). The right and left hand sides <b>40</b>R, <b>40</b>L of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>are defined with respect to the location of the product primary travel path, so that the right hand side <b>40</b>R of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>extends from a generally medial position above and/or below the product travel path and rightward therefrom, while the left hand side <b>40</b>L of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>extends from a generally medial position above and/or below the product travel path and leftward therefrom. Thus, it will be understood that the right side <b>40</b>R of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>is not limited to the rightmost portion of the frame structure and the left side <b>40</b>L of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>is not limited to the leftmost portion of the frame structure.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is also noted that different mounting orientation configurations of the modules and/or apparatus are shown in the figures. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the clipper <b>40</b> mounted on one side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f</i>, but other views may have the clipper <b>40</b> on the other side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>and/or in the front or back of the module <b>40</b>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>. Thus, the figures may show certain of the devices in different views with different mounting configurations and the views in different figures do not necessarily correspond to a common or single mounting arrangement as different views may have certain components and/or devices oriented differently.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention is particularly suitable for applying closure clips to discrete objects held in a covering material. The covering material may be natural or synthetic and may be a casing material that can be sealed about a product or may be netting. The casing can be any suitable casing (edible or inedible, natural or synthetic) such as, but not limited to, collagen, cellulose, plastic, elastomeric or polymeric casing. In certain embodiments, the casing comprises netting. The term &#x201c;netting&#x201d; refers to any open mesh material in any form including, for example, knotted, braided, extruded, stamped, knitted, woven or otherwise. Typically, the netting is configured so as to be stretchable in both axial and lateral directions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Netting or other covering material may be used to package discrete meat products such as loaves of meat, boned ham, spiral sliced ham, deboned ham, turkey, turkey loaves held in molds, or other meat or items directly or with the items held in subcontainers and/or wraps such as molds, trays, boxes, bags, absorbent or protective sheets, sealant, cans and the like. Other embodiments of the present invention may be directed to package other types of food such as cheese, bread, fruit, vegetables, and the like, as well as non-food items. Examples of non-food items that may be packaged using embodiments of the present invention include living items such as flora, trees, and the like, as well as inanimate objects. Additional examples of products include discrete, semi-solid or solid objects such as firewood, pet food (typically held in a container if the wet type), recreational objects (such as balls), or other solid or semi-solid objects. The product may be packaged for any suitable industry including horticulture, aquaculture, agriculture, or other food industry, environmental, chemical, explosive, or other application. Netting may be particularly useful to package ham or turkeys, manufactured hardware such as automotive parts, firewood, explosives, molded products, and other industrial, consumable, and/or commodity item(s).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Generally stated, embodiments of the present invention are directed at automating the packaging of piece goods or discrete items by forcing them through a product chute and wrapping or enveloping the objects at the other end of the chute in a covering material, such as netting, then automatically or semi-automatically clipping the covering material with a closure clip or other attachment means to close the covering and hold the object or objects inside of the covering material. As noted above, clippers are available from Tipper Tie, Inc., of Apex, N.C. Examples of suitable clips include metallic generally &#x201c;U&#x201d;-shaped clips available from Tipper Tie, Inc., in Apex, N.C. Other clips, clip materials and clip configurations or closure means may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary automatic clipping packaging apparatus <b>10</b> according to embodiments of the present invention. As shown, the apparatus <b>10</b> includes a product pusher assembly or mechanism <b>20</b>, a product chute <b>30</b>, and a clipper <b>40</b>. It is noted that the clipper <b>40</b> may be referred to herein as a clipper apparatus, clipper module, clipper mechanism, and/or clipper assembly, but each term may be used interchangeably with the others. As shown, the apparatus <b>10</b> may optionally include an infeed conveyor <b>50</b>. Optionally, the apparatus <b>10</b> may also include a handle maker <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the apparatus <b>10</b> with examples of housing guards <b>11</b> disposed over certain functional components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> illustrate the apparatus <b>10</b> without the housing guards <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment shown, the apparatus <b>10</b> can be described as a horizontal automatic clipping packaging apparatus as the product is primarily moved, processed, clipped and packaged in a horizontal plane. However, certain components, features or operations may be oriented and/or carried out in other planes or directions and the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the product chute <b>30</b> and/or the conveyor <b>50</b> may be configured to incline. The arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> indicates the primary direction of product flow, toward the product chute <b>30</b> and clipper <b>40</b>. In addition, although the downstream direction <b>10</b><i>d </i>is shown as in a direction that extends from right to left (with the upstream direction <b>10</b><i>u</i>) in the opposing direction, the apparatus <b>10</b> can be oriented to run left to right or in a direction that is in or out of the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> also illustrate a human machine interface (&#x201c;HMI&#x201d;) station <b>55</b> that houses operational switches or components that an operator can access to operate the apparatus <b>10</b>. The apparatus <b>10</b> includes a product transfer zone <b>65</b>, which is the location where a product (or products) is positioned, intermediate the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> (in the retracted position) and the product chute <b>30</b>, and substantially aligned with the internal cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the product chute <b>30</b>. This positioning of the product in the flow path and/or alignment with the product chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>can be carried out substantially automatically as will be discussed further below. However, a target product undergoing packaging can also be manually introduced or placed into the flow path and subsequently processed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In operation, the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> linearly retracts and advances to push a product through the product chute <b>30</b> so that the product is positioned proximate the clipper <b>40</b>, then retracts to a resting state upstream of the product transfer zone <b>65</b>. As described above, a sleeve of covering material (designated at <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be positioned about the external surface of the product chute <b>30</b> and configured to be drawn downstream thereof so as to automatically encase the product as the product emerges from the discharge end <b>30</b><i>d </i>of the product chute <b>30</b>. A supplemental sleeve material holder may also be used if desired instead of placing the sleeve of casing material on the product chute. The supplemental sleeve holder can be configured to surround a downstream portion of the product chute <b>30</b>. The sleeve of covering material may be sized to stretch to substantially conform to the external wall or surface of the product chute <b>30</b> or may be more loosely held thereon. The cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the product chute <b>30</b> may be sized to snugly contact or squeeze opposing portions of the product (side to side and/or top to bottom) as the product is pushed therethrough or may be oversized with respect to the product so that the product loosely travels therethrough. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>is undersized relative to the chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>so that the product chute <b>30</b> and pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>are configured to engage in an unsealed configuration. That is, in some embodiments, the product chute <b>30</b> is unsealed and open to environmental conditions at both egress <b>30</b><i>d </i>and ingress axially opposing ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In operation, the sleeve of covering material may be clipped, welded, fused, knotted or otherwise closed and sealed at a leading edge portion thereof. When the product exits the product chute <b>30</b>, it is held in the covering material as the covering material is drawn downstream. The covering material may be loaded onto the product chute <b>30</b> and the leading edge portion thereof closed before the product chute <b>30</b> is mounted to the apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the product pusher mechanism or assembly <b>20</b> has a pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>that contacts the product and pushes the product downstream through the product chute <b>30</b>. After the product exits the product chute <b>30</b>, the downstream portion or leading edge of the product in the covering material can be held in position proximate the clipper <b>40</b>. In certain embodiments, the product can be held by a retractable product holding member disposed downstream of the clipper <b>40</b> to inhibit the product from migrating downstream, thereby holding the product in the covering material between the product holding member and the discharge end of the product chute <b>30</b> during the clipping operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> can include a discharge tray <b>66</b> that receives the clipped and packaged product after clipping. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tray <b>66</b> comprises a floor of rollers. Other discharge tray configurations may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate that the discharge end portion of the product chute <b>30</b> can be positioned proximate and upstream of the clipper <b>40</b>. The product pusher assembly <b>20</b> has a pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>that is adapted to contact the product. As shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>may be configured to substantially fill the entire cross-sectional width of the product chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>as the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>approaches and/or exits the discharge portion of the product chute <b>30</b><i>d</i>. The clipper <b>40</b> is configured to reside in a retracted position out of the product travel region to allow the enclosed product to pass unimpeded until the product rests against the product-holding member <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>B, the clipper <b>40</b> can be pivotably mounted <b>40</b><i>p </i>to a frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>and sized and configured to automatically and controllably actuate (via a pneumatic or fluid cylinder) to advance into a clipping position after the product is in position downstream thereof, then clip the covering material and retract to await to clip the next covering material for the next enclosed product. The clipper <b>40</b> may operate in response to data from a proximity sensor that is positioned to detect when a product is ready for clipping and provide the data to a controller or processor. The proximity sensor may be positioned at any suitable place to indicate when the product is in position. The proximity sensor can be an optical sensor (infrared, photosensor, or the like), a hall-effect sensor, a magnetic sensor, an inductive sensor, and/or any other suitable sensor. The clipper <b>40</b> can be attached to a clipper rotation rotary actuator that can control the movement of the clipper <b>40</b> during use.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, as shown, for example, in FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>E, the apparatus <b>10</b> may include a voiding mechanism <b>69</b> (also known as a voider) that cooperates with the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> and handle maker <b>60</b> (where used) to help gather and &#x201c;void&#x201d; the casing or covering material prior to clipping. The voiding mechanism <b>69</b> can include a pair of spaced apart plates <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>that can move together and apart, each with a window that converges upon the covering material that is held in tension therethrough, to force excess product out of the clipping area/volume as is well known to those of skill in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates the clipper <b>40</b> in a home position (generally upright) and the voider plates <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>), <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>) open and ready to accept a target product (the product flows or travels into the page). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a back view of the module <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; that shows the voider plates in position. The upstream plate <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>may be fixed in the product flow direction but is typically configured to move up and down. The downstream plate <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>can move toward and away from the upstream plate <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>(in the longitudinal direction). The tray <b>66</b> may be inclined during product entry with the flap or trapping members open as shown. The tray <b>66</b> will be discussed further below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> illustrates the clipper <b>40</b> in a clip position and the voider <b>69</b> closed (i.e., the plates <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>and <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>are converged). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> also illustrates the clipper <b>40</b> in a clip position with the voider plates <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>closed and separated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> illustrates the voider plates <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>longitudinally spaced apart and separated to define a voider space <b>69</b><i>sp. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The voider or voiding mechanism <b>69</b> helps to provide a tighter clipped package. In addition, the pusher mechanism <b>20</b> is not required to exit the chute <b>30</b>, particularly when a voider <b>69</b> is employed, and yet still can provide a tight encased package. The handle maker <b>60</b> (where used), the voider <b>69</b> and the brakes <b>90</b> can all contribute to the tension of the covering (e.g., netting) and thus the tightness of the package about the product.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> can operate with an automatic stroke cycle that comprises three dwell positions: a first retracted home position; a second pre-clip position; and a third clipping position. When in the home position, the clipper body is retracted out of the product travel path (typically pivoted outward and upward). In the third clipping position, the clipper travels inward and is generally oriented substantially vertically with the clip window disposed in the product travel path, typically so that the axial centerline of the product chute <b>30</b> is generally aligned with the clip window (not shown). In certain embodiments, the second position of the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> can be between about 50-75% of the stroke distance between the first and third clipper mechanism positions, typically at about 75% of the stroke distance. The travel from the first home to the second pre-clip position can be carried out as the product is exiting the product chute <b>30</b> to save the cycle time that it would take to clip the product while waiting for the clipper to travel the full &#x201c;home to clip position&#x201d; cycle. For example, where a handle maker <b>60</b> is used (the handle maker being an optional device and/or operation), the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> can advance from the home to the pre-clip second position during the handle-making operation. It is noted that the dwell times in each position can be different. The home dwell time may have the longest duration in any stroke cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C, the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> can include an actuation cylinder <b>140</b> that controllably and serially advances the clipper mechanism from the first (home) position, to the second (pre-clip) position, and the third (fill clip) position, then back to the pre-clip or first (home) position. In certain embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref>, the clipper <b>40</b> includes an integrated double two stroke cylinder <b>140</b> with upper and lower cylinder rods <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>2</sub>. The stroke length of the upper rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>1 </sub>may be shorter than the stroke length of the lower rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>2</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the lower rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>2 </sub>extends a greater distance than the upper rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>1 </sub>in the home position. In the full clip position, both cylinder rods <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>2 </sub>can be in a retracted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> illustrates the clipper in an exemplary pre-clip or intermediate dwell position. The lower rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>2 </sub>can be extended a greater distance than the upper rod <b>140</b><i>r</i><sub>1 </sub>at the home configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate that the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> can include a product pusher cylinder <b>21</b> and two product pusher guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, respectively. The product pusher guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> can be positioned on opposing sides of the pusher cylinder <b>21</b> and help to stabilize (i.e., provide an anti-rotation structure) for the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>as the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>travels, particularly when it travels outside the product chute <b>30</b>. As shown, the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> can include a coupler <b>20</b><i>c </i>that can attach the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows the pusher assembly <b>20</b> with the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and coupler <b>20</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) removed, illustrating the guide tubes <b>22</b><i>t</i>, <b>23</b><i>t </i>that are in communication with the guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>, the pusher assembly <b>20</b> can include at least one, (illustrated herein as two), 3-way power valves <b>20</b><i>v</i>, one positioned on each end portion of the cylinder <b>21</b>. The product pusher assembly <b>20</b> can also include at least one pressure regulator and an air source in communication with the cylinder <b>21</b>. In operation, the pressure regulator can allow the cylinder <b>21</b> to operate at up to about 80 psi (653 1b<sub>f</sub>). The cylinder <b>21</b> may be operated at a substantially constant fixed pressure of between about 50-80 psi. In certain embodiments, the pressure is maintained at about 80 psi to allow the pusher <b>20</b> to push the product through the chute <b>30</b> even when the product is slightly oversized, thereby shaping the product as it travels through the chute <b>30</b>. The bore size of the cylinder <b>21</b> may be about 3.25 inches. This shaping may be particularly suitable for whole or partial hams, including bone-in hams, as such a shaping operation may form increased numbers of center slices.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a control housing <b>155</b> can hold system valves, pressure transducers, actuator controls, a processor that directs the automated operations of the apparatus <b>10</b> which may also be held in total or partially in the HMI <b>55</b> and other electronic, software and/or mechanical equipment as will be understood by one of skill in the art. The HMI <b>55</b> may include a touch screen interface/user input.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate that the product transfer zone <b>65</b> that can have a ceiling or lid <b>65</b><i>c </i>that overlies the floor <b>65</b><i>f </i>and a sensor <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) held above the floor <b>65</b><i>f </i>(typically in the ceiling <b>65</b><i>c</i>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6A</figref>, the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> is shown retracted with the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>upstream of the product chute <b>30</b>. The ceiling <b>65</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be pivotably mounted to the frame of the apparatus <b>10</b> to allow an operator easier access to the transport zone <b>65</b> for clearing misfeeds and the like. The sensor <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) can be an ultrasonic sensor configured to identify when a product is in a suitable deployable position in the underlying space of the product transfer zone <b>65</b>. This data can be fed to a controller that can then timely activate the actuation cylinder <b>21</b> to advance the product pusher assembly <b>20</b>. In operation, if an expected product is not delivered to the product transfer zone <b>65</b> within a predetermined time, a timing circuit (typically included in the machine control logic program code) can automatically stop the infeed conveyor <b>50</b>. An operator can restart the apparatus <b>10</b> by depressing the start pushbutton.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> also show a stop member <b>65</b><i>s </i>that can move toward the conveyor <b>50</b> to help align the incoming product on the primary travel path, so that the center of the product is generally aligned and in line with the axial centerline of the product chute <b>30</b>. The stop member <b>65</b><i>s </i>can be moved in and out (as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) in response to when product is determined to be in position in the transfer zone <b>65</b>, such as via direction of the controller based on a signal from the proximity sensor <b>61</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows that the stop plate <b>65</b><i>s </i>can be in communication with at least one (shown as two) adjuster rods <b>65</b><i>r </i>to allow the apparatus <b>10</b> to adjust the position and/or travel distance to accommodate different size in-feed conveyors <b>50</b> as well as different sized chutes <b>30</b> and/or products. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> also illustrates that a housing guard <b>65</b><i>g </i>may be positioned in the transfer zone <b>65</b> on the other side of the stop member <b>65</b><i>s. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a product <b>180</b> on the floor <b>50</b><i>f </i>of the conveyor <b>50</b> and positioned in the product transfer zone <b>65</b>. The product <b>180</b> is stopped by the product stop plate <b>65</b><i>s </i>from progressing out of alignment with the outer perimeter of the chute <b>30</b> so that the product is in communication with the inlet portion of the chute <b>30</b> and so that the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> will be able to push the product <b>180</b> axially downstream through the product chute <b>30</b> substantially about the chute axis <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It is noted that in lieu of and/or with the conveyor <b>50</b>, other moving floors or product advancement systems may be used (for example, rollers, rolling bars, belts or drives that advance trays or other support members and the like). In addition, the moving floor may be angularly oriented to travel up, down, or otherwise to advance the product to the product transfer zone <b>65</b>. In addition, the apparatus <b>10</b> can include an automated continuous advancement system with discrete product(s) separated at desired intervals on the moving floor to serially introduce product for packaging to the chute <b>30</b>. In certain embodiments, the moving floor can include partitions, channels, or other spacer configurations to hold the product(s) in desired alignment on the moving floor so that, when the proximity sensor indicates the product is present, the partition or channel provides the desired product stop.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For groups of objects, manual or automated bins or feeders can accumulate the desired amount of grouped objects upstream and place them together on the moving floor (not shown). In other embodiments, an automated counter can be used to count the number of products that pass a target location or enter the transfer zone <b>65</b> so that a desired number of products are accumulated in the transfer zone <b>65</b> and activate the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> (not shown). The conveyor <b>50</b> and chute <b>30</b> may be configured to have a gap or bridge space therebetween, depending on the size of the conveyor <b>50</b>. In certain particular embodiments, a gap space of about 2.5 inches extends in the axial direction between the conveyor <b>50</b> and the chute <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> may include another sensor <b>31</b> positioned proximate the receiving end of the product chute <b>30</b>. The sensor <b>31</b> is configured to confirm that the product chute <b>30</b> is in operative position. When a product <b>180</b> is detected in the transfer zone <b>65</b>, the activation of the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> may also be based on whether the product chute <b>30</b> is determined to be in proper position using data from the sensor <b>31</b>, typically positioned on the frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>thereat. An exemplary sensor <b>31</b> is a two-part magnetic switch; one part can be positioned on a mounting bracket <b>31</b><i>b </i>attached to a chute bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the other part held on the mounting frame <b>10</b><i>f</i>. When the two matable parts of the switch <b>31</b> engage, the chute <b>30</b> is determined to be in proper position. Other types and/or additional sensors may also be used as suitable as is known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A controller/processor (such as a Programmable Logic Controller) may be configured to monitor a signal from this sensor <b>31</b> and deactivate the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> (release cylinder pressure) automatically whenever a product chute <b>30</b> position-error is noted at any time during the process. The signal can be automatically monitored through a Safety Circuit Module. If the product chute <b>30</b> is missing or out of position, the apparatus <b>10</b> can be held in a low energy state that removes power to air supplies and controls to inhibit machine operation. To reinitiate the procedure, an operator may press a restart or reset button. In certain embodiments, the clipper <b>40</b> may be operated on override even when the chute <b>30</b> is absent. Once the product chute <b>30</b> is in location and the stop is reset, power air can be applied to the machine control valves and electric power can be applied to the control (PLC) outputs. After the PLC determines the positions of the moveable components, such as the product pusher assembly <b>20</b>, the clipper <b>40</b>, the product holding member and the like, an automatic reset can be performed and those components automatically moved to a respective home position as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the HMI <b>55</b> can include an input display screen, an emergency stop button <b>56</b>, a reset button and a clipper only activation button. The HMI can also include a pressure regulator for corresponding gages. The pressure regulators can be for the retractable product holding member on a discharge tray (which may be described as a product clamp bar), and/or for a retractable brake system <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), typically used to selectively apply brake pressure to the covering material proximate the discharge end portion of the product chute <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The apparatus <b>10</b> may be configured to allow the clipper <b>40</b> to operate irrespective of the upstream devices using the clipper-only push button instead of the apparatus-start push button. The HMI <b>55</b> can also include an emergency stop <b>56</b> and reset pushbutton or other type of switch as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> also illustrates that the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>can be configured with a product pusher plate <b>20</b><i>p </i>that is adapted to contact the product <b>180</b> (such as food) as the pusher assembly <b>20</b> extends forward. The pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>can also include axially extending guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2</sub>. The pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>can be sized and configured to substantially fill the chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>to thereby inhibit objects from attempting to migrate downstream during the pushing operation. The pusher plate <b>20</b><i>p </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> as a forward portion adapted to contact the product which, when viewed from the top, comprises side portions that angularly converge to a recessed medial planar portion shape; other configurations and shapes may also be used as will be discussed further below. The shape of the product-contacting portion <b>20</b><i>p </i>of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>may influence the orientation (typically the attitude) of the product inside the netting as it exits the chute <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> also illustrates the assembly <b>20</b> and/or the product pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>in a home or resting position. The pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>may include a forward plow configuration to help center the product (such as a bone-in ham product). The plow may have a width of about 5 inches. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate that the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>may include a forward outwardly extending piercing member <b>20</b><i>m </i>such as a nail, blade, pin, or other sharp implement that can pierce a rearward portion of the product to help keep the product in alignment as it is pushed through the chute <b>30</b>. As such, the apparatus <b>10</b> can employ a removing member that can be positioned to cooperate with the chute to remove the member prior to clipping (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, the product pusher mechanism <b>20</b> is configured to limit the travel of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>so that at least a portion of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>remains inside the product chute <b>30</b> at a furthermost operative extension position (extended position) of the product pusher mechanism <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, the forward portion of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>passes out of the chute <b>30</b> downstream of the gathering plates while in still other embodiments, the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>stops short of the downstream most gathering plate (the gathering plates will be discussed further below). In operation, the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>is configured to push the product from the discharge end of the chute <b>20</b><i>d </i>so that the covering material extends a sufficient distance therefrom to allow an automated clipping operation to be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, as described above, the product pusher mechanism <b>20</b> comprises a pair of spaced apart elongate guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2 </sub>positioned on opposing sides of the forward portion of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>to help guide the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>in the product chute <b>30</b>. The guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2 </sub>may have a length that is less than the length of the product chute <b>30</b>. The guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2 </sub>may each connect (directly or indirectly) to a guide rod <b>23</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively. The guiderods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> may be symmetrically arranged with respect to the intermediately located pusher cylinder <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and <b>5</b>A, the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> can operate using a fluid-actuated cylinder <b>21</b> (typically a pneumatic cylinder) that is longitudinally mounted on the apparatus <b>10</b> and extends in the axial direction. The centerline of the cylinder <b>21</b> may be aligned with the product chute centerline <b>30</b>. The two guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> can be stainless steel guide rods mounted in a linear ball bearing block assembly. As noted above, the guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> can act as an anti-rotation stabilizer for the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> and/or help guide the head <b>20</b><i>h </i>to travel in a substantially straight line through the product chute <b>30</b> as the head <b>20</b><i>h </i>travels repetitively through extended and retracted configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2 </sub>and/or the forward portion <b>20</b><i>p </i>of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>may be formed of and/or coated with a non-stick material (and/or lubricant) such as TEFLON. In particular embodiments, such as for packaging of meat, the guidewalls <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>20</b><i>w</i><sub>2 </sub>may be formed of acetyl while the forward portion <b>20</b><i>p </i>can be formed of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The conveyor system <b>50</b> may include a DELRIN conveyor floor support, belt drive sprockets, air motor and gear box that can automatically advance the conveyor floor. The conveyor floor material may be an open mesh, interlocking material, such as an interlaced composite material. Generally stated, in the embodiment shown, the conveyor floor is driven by a series of sprockets that engage the weave and/or underside of the conveyor floor. A radial piston air motor drives the conveyor floor through a speed reduction gearbox. Power is transmitted to the conveyor drive roller via a chain and sprocket configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a side view of the product chute <b>30</b> held on a mounting bracket and attached to the frame <b>10</b><i>f</i>. As shown, the product chute <b>30</b> can be an elongate product chute. The product chute <b>30</b> can include a larger front-end cavity area <b>30</b><i>a </i>(shown as a funnel-like shape) relative to the intermediate and/or discharging portion <b>30</b><i>d</i>, i.e., the chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>narrows in the pushing/product travel direction. Thus, the product chute <b>30</b> can include a primary body and a larger upstream guide portion that narrows into the shape of the primary body. The chute <b>30</b> may be formed as a unitary member or a series of attached members (not shown). The chute <b>30</b> can include a lifting handle <b>30</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) to facilitate removal and installation. In operation, a supply of covering material <b>130</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be placed on or about the chute <b>30</b>, arranged to surround the exterior surface of at least a portion of the product chute <b>30</b> and extend in tension in the downstream direction to cover the product (tenting/tensioning in the axial direction) as the product exits the discharge end portion of the product chute <b>30</b><i>d</i>. In certain embodiments, the covering material is configured and sized to stretch in at least the lateral direction and typically in both the lateral and axial directions as it is held on and dispensed from the product chute <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The product chute floor may be a stationary floor with an anti-stick coating or material. It is also noted that the product chute <b>30</b> may include a moving floor such as those types described above with respect to the infeed floor configurations. The chute <b>30</b> may be sized relative to the product <b>180</b> so that the product <b>180</b> extends across a major portion of the width of the cavity, and in certain embodiments, extends across at least about 75% of the width of the cavity. In certain embodiments, the product <b>180</b> and chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c </i>are sized so that the sides and/or top and bottom of the product <b>180</b> are pressed against the sidewalls of the cavity as the product is pushed therethrough. The product chute <b>30</b> may comprise stainless steel and be coated with a friction reducing material such as TEFLON polymer. Lubricants may also be disposed on the inner surface(s) of the product chute <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In certain embodiments, the product chute <b>30</b> has a cross-sectional profile that is non-circular. The product chute <b>30</b> may be configured with a planar top and/or bottom portion and semi-circular side portions. Other cross-sectional profile configurations may also be used including, but not limited to, circular, oval, triangular, rectangular, square and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be configured to relatively easily attach to and be removed from the frame of the apparatus <b>10</b> so as to be releasably mountable thereto. The mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>can hold the product chute <b>30</b> in alignment with the clipper mechanism <b>40</b> downstream and the product pusher mechanism <b>20</b> upstream. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an alligator clip can be used in combination with a sensor <b>130</b><i>s </i>to clip to a trailing edge of the covering material and trip a switch to automatically monitor and alert when the covering material is low and/or may need replaced. In certain embodiments, the system <b>10</b> can include a first product chute and a respective first mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>and a second product chute <b>30</b> releasably mountable to the apparatus frame <b>10</b> at the same position (interchangeable chutes) using a respective second mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>that can be configured substantially the same as the first mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, the product chute <b>30</b> can be lifted off of the mounting bracket <b>30</b><i>b </i>(leaving the mounting bracket in place) and another chute <b>30</b> placed thereon. The second product chute may be sized and configured the same as the first product chute <b>30</b> and loaded with a second supply of covering material. The covering material may be the same as that of the first product chute or different. Thus, the respective first and second mounting brackets <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be configured as quick disconnect components (merely loosening and/or releasing attachment hardware) to allow the first and second product chutes <b>30</b> to be interchanged on the system <b>10</b> in under 5 minutes, and more typically in under about 2 minutes, to allow an operator to employ at least one of a different size product chute, a different configuration product chute, different packaging material dispensed by the product chute.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In other embodiments, a plurality of chutes <b>30</b> can be mounted on a sliding or movable track that can serially move a selected chute out of and/or into the operative position (not shown). The plurality of chutes <b>30</b> may be positioned side to side or above and below each other (vertically stacked), mounted on a carousel, or the like so as to automatically move into and out of position. In operation, an operator or an autoloader can place a sleeve of covering material on one or more chutes <b>30</b>, select the order of presentation (based on the type of product being dispensed and/or the type of covering material desired), and proceed to move the chutes serially into operative position so as to be aligned with the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> and the clipper <b>40</b>. In this manner, the apparatus <b>10</b> can be preloaded or reloaded with covering material limiting any downtime associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> and <b>12</b>A illustrate a downstream module <b>40</b><i>m </i>which can be a discrete portion of the apparatus <b>10</b> according to certain embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate the module <b>40</b><i>m </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> with housing guards <b>11</b> removed and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B</figref>, <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>D illustrate the module <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> with the guards <b>11</b> removed. When the handle maker <b>60</b> is not assembled, a planar housing sidewall <b>11</b><i>s </i>can be used to close the module <b>40</b><i>m </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the handle maker <b>60</b> and frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>can also be configured to allow the handle maker <b>60</b> (as well as the clipper <b>40</b>) to mount to either the left or right hand side <b>40</b>L, <b>40</b>R, respectively, of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>(and primary product travel path) with their respective housing guards <b>11</b> likewise mountable to either side. Typically, the handle maker <b>60</b> (where used) will mount to a different opposing side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>from the clipper <b>40</b>. An example of a suitable handle-maker is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,729,102, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>can have pre-formed apertures, brackets, or other structures or members that can allow the clipper <b>40</b> and/or handle maker <b>60</b> to mount to the desired side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>without customizing the frame for a particular customer. The clipper <b>40</b> will typically mount to a top portion of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>in a manner that allows the clipper <b>40</b> to dynamically retract and advance into clipping position as discussed above. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 12A</figref>, the clipper <b>40</b> is mounted to an upper portion of the right hand side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>using a coupler member <b>240</b>. In operation, the clipper <b>40</b> moves inward to a desired clip location. The coupler member <b>240</b> can alternatively be assembled to the upper portion of the left hand side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>allowing the clipper <b>40</b> to move inward to the same operative location. The frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>and the clipper <b>40</b> and/or handle maker <b>60</b> are also modular to be able to provide several build options so as to be assembled to the desired side of the frame during manufacturing assembly to meet a customer's order without customizing each component for each customer. This will allow a decrease in labor, less single-purpose inventory, and/or faster build cycles. For example, a modular frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>may have additional apertures over specific use frames. Unused apertures may be sealed, filled or closed for sanitary reasons, such as with fasteners or plugs.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In any event, the modules <b>40</b><i>m</i>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; are arranged to align with the chute <b>30</b> such that the discharge end portion of the product chute <b>30</b><i>d </i>terminates proximate the clipper <b>40</b>. The modules <b>40</b><i>m</i>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; are configured to hold the clipper <b>40</b> so that the clip window <b>140</b><i>w </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) can be generally axially aligned with a desired axial location of the product travel path in the full clip position (see the centerline location illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), typically the axial centerline of the chute <b>30</b>, irrespective of whether the clipper <b>40</b> is mounted to the right or left hand side of the frame <b>40</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As described above, the apparatus <b>10</b> can include a brake assembly with brake gripping members <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the gripping members <b>90</b> are housed in the clipper module <b>40</b><i>m</i>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; and, in position, reside adjacent the sidewalls of the chute <b>30</b>. The brake assembly can inhibit an excessive quantity of covering material from being pulled off the chute <b>30</b> during product insertion into the covering. The brake assembly may be particularly suitable for use with netting covering materials. In addition, the product covering can be held (stretched axially) to be relatively tight and substantially centered about the encased product. The tightness or tension of the covering material may be adjusted by varying the force that the gripper members <b>90</b> apply to the chute <b>30</b>. Where a pneumatic cylinder is used to automatically operate the brakes, the force/tension adjustment can be carried out by adjusting the air pressure delivered to the cylinder. A pressure regulator for this operation may be disposed on the HMI <b>55</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, the modules <b>40</b><i>m</i>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; include a product-holding member (i.e., product clamp) that can automatically be moved into position by actuating a clamp drive cylinder, thereby blocking the product from moving further downstream (not shown). See, e.g., co-pending, co-assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/508,609, Filed Oct. 3, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. The optional holding member may be configured to actuate to its operative holding position prior to retraction of the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> and/or to clamp onto the encased product to inhibit the product from migrating back into the chute as the product pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>is retracted. The holding member can also hold the encased product so that the upstream covering material is relatively firmly or tightly held proximate the clipper <b>40</b> and/or facilitate centering the covering material during the gathering and clipping operations. The holding member can be integrated with the handle maker <b>60</b> (where used) or it can be a separate component. Co-assigned U.S. Provisional Application filed Jun. 15, 2004 and identified by 60/579,709 and further describes a flap configuration that can be used to hold the product and co-pending, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein. Thus, other discharge tables or product holding members may be used in lieu of and/or with the table <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In certain embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, the discharge table <b>66</b>&#x2032; is interchangeable with that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. The table or tray <b>66</b>&#x2032; includes two slots <b>66</b><i>s</i>, each holding a translatable flap <b>75</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>75</b><sub>2 </sub>with a leg that travels in a respective slot. The flaps <b>75</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>75</b><sub>2 </sub>can automatically move upstream and downstream and pivot to move closer together (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>). The flap configuration can be configured to orient a bone in a bone-in ham product so that the product can be clipped on the bone end, such that the netted product hangs generally straight and provides additional spiral cuts as the spiral cut is performed on the axis of the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The actuation of the holding member can be controlled by the PLC using proximity sensors and operation feedback as will be understood by one of skill in the art. The discharge table <b>66</b> may be stationary (with or without rollers as shown). In other embodiments, the product table <b>66</b> may include a traveling floor (such as a conveyor) that advances the packaged product to another processing or subsequent workstation (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates that the front end of the apparatus <b>10</b> can include a frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>that is modular. The frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>holds the chute <b>30</b> and the pusher assembly <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>may also hold the in-feed conveyor <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a control box <b>155</b> and PLC interface <b>55</b>. The frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>can be configured to accommodate different size interchangeable chutes <b>30</b> and/or different widths of conveyor <b>50</b>. For example, the apparatus <b>10</b> can operate with larger and smaller chutes <b>30</b>, which can be placed on the frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>at the OEM site and/or at a use site, depending on a particular product/use. The chute widths may range from between about 9-13 inches and the height of the chutes <b>30</b> may be between about 5-12 inches. A smaller chute <b>30</b> may have a cavity that is about 9 inches wide by 5.75 inches tall while a larger chute <b>30</b> may have a cavity that is about 13 inches wide by about 11.25 inches tall. The chutes <b>30</b> may have a length (at least for the portion having a generally constant cross-sectional area) that is between about 28-30 inches. The chutes <b>30</b> may also have a flared or funnel-like entry portion <b>30</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with a length of about 4-10 inches. The funnel <b>30</b><i>f </i>may be formed with larger flares for the larger chutes. In addition, the apparatus frame <b>10</b><i>f </i>may accommodate conveyors <b>50</b> having widths that are between about 18-24 inches wide.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref> illustrate one example of a clipper mechanism <b>40</b>. The clipper <b>40</b> can include a pivot attachment which can be supported by the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>(such as by two trunnion type arms as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) to pivotally mount the clipper to the frame <b>40</b><i>f</i>. The clipper <b>40</b> can include a curvilinear clip rail or channel <b>41</b> that is in communication with the clip window <b>40</b><i>w </i>to automatically supply clips to the underlying covering material. The clipper <b>40</b> may be particularly suitable for clipping netting but may be used for other materials as well. The clipper <b>40</b> can be configured to attach to the coupling member <b>240</b> to suspend the clipper from the frame <b>40</b><i>f </i>as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As is well known to those of skill in the art, in operation, the clipper <b>40</b> defines a closure/clip delivery path using a clip rail <b>41</b> in communication with the clip window <b>40</b><i>w </i>in a clip channel for receipt of a U-shaped metal clip. The clip is advanced in the closure path or channel by means of a punch so that the clip will engage a die positioned in a manner permitting the clip to be formed about gathered material that encases the product in the material at a closure zone in the product travel path. Although not illustrated, pressurized air or other means of pressing or moving the clip to close about the tubular package may also be used. As shown, the guide rail <b>41</b> can have a curvilinear configuration with a vertical run which is curved at its lower end so that it gradually merges into a horizontal run to direct clips mounted thereon into the window <b>40</b><i>w</i>. The clips are typically arranged in a stack with adjacent clips abutting each other so that the legs of each clip fit around the guide rail with a crown of each clip fitting over the guide rail. The multiple clips may be connected to one another by means of a thin elastomeric film, tape or adhesive (typically along the crown) so that the clips together may slide down the guide rail and around the bend therein between the vertical and horizontal runs of the guide rail. Typically, clips are provided in a coil or on a reel for feeding onto the guide rail. Although illustrated herein as a generally vertical and downwardly directed clip feed, other feed orientations may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref>, the clipper <b>40</b> can include a cutting member <b>165</b> mounted to a lower portion of the clipper body. The cutting member <b>165</b> is configured to cut from the bottom up. The cutting member <b>165</b> can be configured to move in concert with the clipper <b>40</b> as the clipper <b>40</b> moves to its home and full clip position (and, where used, to the pre-clip position). As shown, gathering plates <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> can be mounted to the lower portion of the clipper <b>40</b> with the clip window <b>40</b><i>w </i>therebetween. When the clipper <b>40</b> is in its full-clip position, such as in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the cutting member <b>165</b> is generally vertically oriented and disposed under the gathering plate windows <b>141</b><i>w</i>, <b>142</b><i>w</i>, respectively. The cutting member <b>165</b> can then rise to sever the gathered and typically clipped or otherwise closed/sealed covering about the package. The cutting member <b>165</b> can be in communication with an actuator <b>165</b><i>c </i>that automatically extends the cutting member into the cutting position, then retracts the cutting member <b>165</b>. The cutting member <b>165</b> can reside and slidably travel in a cutting guide <b>166</b> having a channel <b>166</b><i>c</i>. The guide <b>166</b> can be aligned with the gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, typically disposed axially intermediate thereof, and can be attached to the clipper <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the guide <b>166</b> may be formed into a gathering plate (not shown). Typically, the guide <b>166</b> is disposed proximate but upstream of the clipping location, at least where a single clip is applied. Where two spaced-apart clips are applied to the gathered covering, the guide <b>166</b> can be held intermediate the two clip locations to provide the desired cut location.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref> are enlarged views of the cutting member <b>165</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is illustrated with certain features shaded so that the underlying cutting knife and cutting channel are visible. The cutting guide <b>166</b> has opposing upper and lower portions, <b>166</b><i>u</i>, <b>166</b><i>l</i>, respectively, with an intermediate window portion <b>166</b><i>w </i>extending intermediate thereof. The window portion <b>166</b><i>w </i>can be aligned with the gathering plate window. The cutting guide channel <b>166</b><i>c </i>can extend both in the upper and lower portions of the guide <b>166</b>. In operation, the cutting member <b>165</b> slides upwardly in the lower channel <b>166</b><i>c</i>, extends across the window <b>166</b><i>w </i>and into the channel <b>166</b><i>c </i>in the upper portion <b>166</b><i>u </i>of the cutting guide <b>165</b>. The cutting guide channel <b>166</b><i>c </i>can be formed into a unitary body. Alternatively, the cutting guide <b>166</b> can comprise two members with generally planar downwardly extending sidewalls that are spaced apart a distance sufficient to receive and allow the cutting member <b>165</b> to slide while retained in a desired alignment. The two spaced apart members may be plates and/or the channel <b>166</b><i>c </i>may be generally planar. The cutting member <b>165</b> can be configured to remain in the lower body channel <b>166</b><i>l </i>during periods of non-use.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, (with one gathering plate omitted for clarity) one long edge portion <b>165</b><i>e </i>of the cutting member <b>165</b> can be retained in the cutting guide channel <b>166</b><i>c </i>as the cutting member <b>166</b> travels across the guide window <b>166</b><i>w </i>into the extended cutting, shearing and/or severing position. Where used, this positive retention of the cutting member <b>165</b> may provide additional alignment stability in some applications. The cutting member <b>165</b> may be a generally planar blade with a leading angled knife-edge portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Other cutting techniques can be used including, but not limited to, heat (of whatever type), water, pressure, and other knife and/or blade shapes, as well as combinations thereof. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;cutting&#x201d; as used herein is used broadly to mean separating and/or severing adjacent portions of covering material and is not limited to physically cutting with a sharp implement.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, it is noted that the present invention is not limited to a bottom-up cutting operation as top-down cutting mechanisms can be used such as, for example, hot-knife devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,700 and 5,161,347, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The clipper <b>40</b> can include a plurality of spaced apart gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> that are configured to automatically gather a portion of the tubular or sleeve of covering material (held in tension) to form the material into a rope-like and/or compressed configuration in preparation for receiving the clip(s) thereabout. Pairs of cooperating plates can be positioned to retractably travel axially in the product travel path toward and away from each other. As shown, the gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> may be mounted to the clipper <b>40</b> and can be described as clipper gathering plates. See co-pending, co-assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/508,609 for additional description of gathering plates, the contents of which have been incorporated by reference hereinabove. In addition or alternatively, voider plates (shown for example as members <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>69</b><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B</figref>, <b>11</b>C) can be configured to gather or compress the covering material that extends between the clipper <b>40</b> and the product chute discharge end portion <b>30</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In operation, once the covering material is gathered, a clip or clips can be applied to secure the encased product in the covering material. The covering material can then be severed to release the encased product in the clipped package. In certain embodiments, two clips are applied substantially concurrently proximate to each other using a dual clipper so that one clip closes the trailing edge of the covering material forming a first encased package and the other closes a leading edge of the covering material forming the next encased package. The clipped configuration of the covering material encasing the product may be configured to substantially conform to the shape of the enclosed product(s) or may be more loosely configured.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In certain embodiments, after the product moves by (and may be stopped by the product-holding member <b>75</b> (FIG. <b>12</b>C)), the clipper <b>40</b> moves into its full-clip position (either from a home or pre-clip position) with its actuation cylinder <b>140</b>, which also moves the gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> as well as the cutting member guide <b>166</b> and cutting member <b>165</b> toward the centerline of the travel path. The terms &#x201c;actuator&#x201d; or &#x201c;actuation cylinder&#x201d; are used generically to indicate any type of automatically moveable actuation member.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some embodiments, the gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, guide <b>166</b> and cutting member <b>165</b> are mounted to the clipper <b>40</b> (i.e., clipper gathering plates) to move in concert therewith. As the clipper <b>40</b> is rotated into position, the clipper gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> automatically start the gathering operation. In certain embodiments, the modules <b>40</b><i>m</i>, <b>40</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; can include additional gathering plates (not shown) that may be positioned on the opposing side of the travel path and which may be configured to laterally linearly translate into and out of operative position. In certain embodiments, each gathering plate can be mounted so that in operative position they are horizontally and vertically aligned with the corresponding centerlines of the product chute cavity <b>30</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Summarizing some embodiments, when a product or target object enters the product transfer zone <b>65</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), its presence can be automatically determined and the apparatus controller can then activate an automated cycle. The automated cycle can include: stopping the infeed conveyor from advancing and actuating the product pusher assembly cylinder <b>21</b>. The product pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>attached to the product pusher cylinder <b>21</b> and guide rods <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> advance to engage the target product, which is pushed through the product chute <b>30</b> encased in covering material (e.g., netting) upon exit from the product chute <b>30</b>. Upon exiting the product chute <b>30</b>, the encased product is pushed onto the product table <b>66</b>. When the product pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>reaches the end of its forward stroke, its position is detected by a sensor such as a Hall-effect switch, and the product holding member <b>75</b> is actuated. Then, the product pusher assembly head <b>20</b> is retracted into the product chute before the covering material is gathered and clipped. The product pusher cylinder <b>21</b> does not have to be fully retracted prior to initiation of the automated gathering and clipping operations. Once the product pusher head <b>20</b><i>h </i>clears the discharge end of the product chute <b>30</b> or reaches its desired travel stroke extension position, an intermediate sensor, such as another Hall-effect switch, typically placed on the product pusher cylinder <b>21</b>, senses the partial retraction thereof. When the sensor is activated, the apparatus <b>10</b> can automatically (i.e., typically via the PLC) proceed to initiate the handle making (where used), gathering and clipping operations.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Thus, proximate in time to the retraction of the pusher head <b>20</b><i>h</i>, the clipper <b>40</b> automatically pivots into pre-clip position, thereby advancing the clipper gathering plates (where used) to the product centerline to converge the covering material into a rope-like configuration. One or two closure clips can then be applied thereto. The downstream clip ends the first product and the upstream clip defines the first end portion of the next product. The cutting cylinder is actuated and the covering material is severed between the two clips. Once the severing is complete, the cutting cylinder is retracted and the apparatus <b>10</b> can automatically start a reset cycle, returning the clipper <b>40</b> to its home position. The product-holding member <b>75</b> can be moved and the product released to travel downstream. When the clipper <b>40</b> and gathering plates <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> are substantially in their home position, the apparatus <b>10</b> can begin the cycle again. When the product pusher assembly <b>20</b> reaches its retracted configuration, the infeed conveyor <b>50</b> can be started again so that when the reset is complete, another product is in position for entry into the product chute <b>30</b>. In each case if a product is not detected in the transfer zone <b>65</b> in a predetermined time, the apparatus <b>10</b> can shut off and wait for a start signal to reactivate the process/apparatus, such as via a pushbutton at the HMI station.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The operation and sequence of certain events can be controlled by a programmable logic controller. Certain operations may be selected by an operator input using a Human Machine Interface to communicate with the controller as is well known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates exemplary operations that may be carried out according to embodiments of the present invention. As shown, a cutting member can be automatically (including semi-automatically) moved upwardly in a predetermined travel path to sever gathered covering material from the bottom-up (block <b>300</b>). The predetermined direction can be in a direction that is generally orthogonal to a product travel path to sever gathered covering material. The cutting member can then be automatically retracted to a home position (block <b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the operations can also include automatically (which includes semi-automatically) attaching at least one clip to the gathered covering material before the cutting member severs the gathered material (block <b>303</b>). The cutting member can be timed to move upward so that the severing occurs just after the clipping operation (block <b>305</b>). The cutting member can be automatically guided vertically upwardly in a planar channel defined by spaced apart sidewalls of a guide member (block <b>307</b>). The cutting member may include a generally planar blade with an angled leading edge portion that is held trapped in a generally planar aperture (block <b>309</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the operating system <b>452</b> may be any operating system suitable for use with a data processing system, such as OS/2, AIX, DOS, OS/390 or System390 from International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y., Windows CE, Windows NT, Windows95, Windows98 or Windows2000 from Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., Unix or Linux or FreeBSD, Palm OS from Palm, Inc., Mac OS from Apple Computer, LabView, or proprietary operating systems. The I/O device drivers <b>458</b> typically include software routines accessed through the operating system <b>452</b> by the application programs <b>454</b> to communicate with devices such as I/O data port(s), data storage <b>456</b> and certain memory <b>414</b> components. The application programs <b>454</b> are illustrative of the programs that implement the various features of the data processing system and can include at least one application, which supports operations according to embodiments of the present invention.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">While the present invention is illustrated, for example, with reference to the Automated Bottom-UP Actuation Module <b>450</b> being an application program in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, other configurations may also be utilized while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the Module <b>450</b> may also be incorporated into the operating system <b>452</b>, the I/O device drivers <b>458</b> or other such logical division of the data processing system. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, which is intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations described herein. Further, the Module <b>450</b> can be used to operate other apparatus that may employ other chute, horn, and/or clipper types.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The I/O data port can be used to transfer information between the data processing system, the product pusher, and the closure attachment mechanism or another computer system or a network (e.g., the Internet) or to other devices controlled by the processor. These components may be conventional components such as those used in many conventional data processing systems which may be configured in accordance with the present invention to operate as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For example, certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to a computer program product for operating an automated clipped (netting) packaging apparatus so that the clipper mechanism operates from either a left or right hand side. The computer program product can include computer readable program code that allows a user to select left hand or right hand clipping mechanism operation, which may be programmed or selected at the OEM site. That is, the controller may have two program sequences, one for operating left hand operation and one for right hand operation (for either or both the handle-maker and/or clipper). During assembly and/or test, an OEM site can lock in the proper operational sequence. In other embodiments, the program is indifferent to which mounting orientation is used and, as such, a common program can be used to operate the apparatus irrespective of which mounting orientation is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The automated/semi-automated packaging apparatus can include an automated product pusher mechanism that advances and retracts from a product chute and an automated clipping apparatus that applies at least one closure clip to netting thereat.
