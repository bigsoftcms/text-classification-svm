<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to soda, beer, or other types of can recycling devices in general and more specifically to an apparatus and method for removing the tabs from soda, beer, or other types of cans for recycling or charity donation. The present invention uniquely removes the tab of an aluminum or other type of can easily, quickly, and without damage to the can.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aluminum and other types of cans have long been collected and recycled. It is widely understood that the can tabs may also be removed from the cans and recycled separately. As the tabs occupy considerably less volume per unit mass than the cans, amounts recovered from a recycling facility for equivalent volumes are considerably higher for tabs. This phenomena has prompted numerous charities to initiate fund raising projects which collect the tabs and recycle large volumes of them with the proceeds going to the charity. An example of such a charity is the Ronald McDonald houses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior art pop tab removal techniques required users to grasp the tab between the thumb and forefinger and continuously bend and flex the tab until a break from the aluminum can occurs. This was time consuming (typically taking about 10 seconds), laborious, and often left part of the tab attached to the can. The present art utilizes a unique head apparatus connected via a pivot with a pair of force application handles which provide quick, easy, and amusingly interesting tab removal within a fraction of a second. The present art resembles a pliers type device with a head apparatus comprising a uniquely designed lower fork and upper can support. The lower fork fits under the tab and around the tab holding post (an integral rivet like protrusion from the can top) while the upper can support fits within the topmost rim of the can. When force is applied to the handles, the lower fork and upper can support move closer with the upper can support seating onto the topmost rim of the can. When sufficient force is applied to the handles, the tab is removed from the tab holding post and can. The required force is so minimal that a child can operate the present art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present art allows charities and persons which support them to easily and quickly remove large numbers of can tabs without the prior art labor. The present art further provides an amusing pastime activity for adults and children in support of their charity of choice.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pop tab remover which quickly and easily removes tabs from soda, beer, or other types of cans via a simple squeeze of a user's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a pop tab remover which requires a minimal amount of force to remove the can tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of the present invention is to provide a pop tab remover which is easily and economically manufactured.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To accomplish the foregoing and other objects of this invention there is provided a pop tab remover having a having a head, a pivot, and two or more force application handles. The head comprises a uniquely shaped lower fork and a uniquely shaped upper can support which mate or interface with a tab and can.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the lower fork is of a planar substantially circular material having a fork slot which is attached with a lower pivot arm. Also in a preferred embodiment, the upper can support comprises a substantially circular ring attached with an upper pivot arm. Each of the pivot arms are preferably of a planar material and pivotally connected at a pivot point. Said pivot point comprises a short shaft through a hole in each of said pivot arms. Said shaft may comprise a plurality of elements including but not limited to a screw, a rivet, or an extension on one of the pivot arms.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more handles extend proximally from the pivot arms and are preferably covered with a soft flexible grip material. In the preferred embodiment, each handle has a tubular support between the handle and the grip material. This tubular support assures that the grip material retains a substantially circular cross section which allows a more user comfortable grasp. The preferred embodiment also utilizes a torsion spring which is mounted on or with said pivot and which has one or more spring arms extending onto and secured with said handles. The torsion spring provides a natural opening bias force to the head which assures that the head is easily mated with a can and tab.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the preferred embodiment, the upper can support circular ring is of a substantially half spherical form with a slot. The circular ring is substantially represented by the equator of the half sphere which is positioned closest to the lower fork. The slot is positioned substantially orthogonal to the circular ring and extends toward the pole of the substantially half sphere. Said slot provides clearance for the lower pivot arm when the handles are squeezed and the ring approaches the fork. That is, the slot is of a greater width than the thickness of the lower pivot arm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The aforementioned component parts may be manufactured from a variety of materials which provide the structural strength necessary. These include but are not limited to materials such as iron, steel, aluminum, titanium, magnesium and alloys thereof, plastics or other polymers, composites, and various woods. The grip material is preferably of a soft urethane foam but may be of any material in alternative embodiments, including but not limited to polymers, composites, metals, synthetic and natural rubbers, and woods.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> a preferred embodiment of a pop tab remover <b>10</b> having a unique head apparatus <b>12</b>, a pivot <b>26</b>, and two force application handles <b>34</b>. The present art apparatus <b>10</b> is uniquely capable of removing the tab from a soda, beer, or other type of can in a quick, easy, and convenient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The preferred embodiment of the present art <b>10</b> comprises a distal head <b>12</b> having a lower fork <b>14</b> and an upper can support <b>18</b>. When a handle <b>34</b> force is applied during use, the lower fork <b>14</b> and the upper can support <b>18</b> approach and impart a removal force upon the can tab. The lower fork <b>14</b> is attached via a lower pivot arm <b>16</b> to at least one of said force application handles <b>34</b>. The upper can support <b>18</b> is also attached via an upper pivot arm <b>24</b> to at least one of said force application handles <b>34</b> opposite the handle <b>34</b> attached with said lower pivot arm <b>16</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> and handles <b>34</b> are each formed as a single piece from a planar sheet metal material. That is, each combination of arm <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> and handle <b>34</b> is stamped or cut from a sheet metal or other sheet material into the overall form of arm <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> and handle <b>34</b>. The fork <b>14</b> and can support <b>18</b> are preferably attached to the arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> via welding but may be attached in a plurality of ways in alternative embodiments, including but not limited to adhesives, integral molding, press fits, or fasteners such as screws or rivets. Further alternative embodiments may form the arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> and handles <b>34</b> in a plurality of ways or from a plurality of separate parts or pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment, the lower fork <b>14</b> comprises a substantially planar element having a fork slot <b>15</b> of sufficient width to fit or slide around the tab holding post <b>40</b> on the can top and attachment arm <b>42</b> of a can tab. That is, the slot <b>15</b> must not only have sufficient width to slide around the holding post <b>40</b> between the can and tab but must also slide around the tab extension or tab attachment arm <b>42</b> which is held by said rivet. Proper width sizing of the slot <b>15</b> allows complete removal of the tab and its extension or attachment arm <b>42</b> from the can during apparatus <b>10</b> utilization. For enablement purposes only, the slot <b>15</b> is approximately 0.3 inch in width.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A preferred embodiment of the present fork <b>14</b> comprises a substantially circular element with a reduced thickness nearest the circumferential portion of slot <b>15</b> and fork <b>14</b> intersection. The reduced thickness allows easy insertion of the fork <b>14</b> between the tab and can. Preferably, the fork <b>14</b> element size and shape is sufficiently to substantially cover most of the can opening (i.e. liquid exiting portion) whereby the probability of the tab falling into the can after removal is minimized. Alternative embodiments may utilize a plurality of fork <b>14</b> forms, including but not limited to rectangular, semi-circular, octagonal, hexagonal, etc., provided the fork <b>14</b> is sized to fit between the can and tab.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The upper can support <b>18</b> represents the jaw portion of the apparatus <b>10</b> opposite the lower fork <b>14</b>. The upper can support <b>18</b> provides not only a force application function but, in a preferred embodiment, provides an apparatus <b>10</b> centering registration with the top of the can whereby an aligned and substantially perpendicular removal force is applied to the tab. In a preferred embodiment, the upper can support <b>18</b> is represented as a circular ring <b>19</b> with an outside diameter substantially equivalent to or smaller than an inside diameter of a standard can mouth. In order to provide a desired removal force between the can tab and the can, a solid and substantially non-deforming surface or portion of the can must mate or seat with a portion of the upper can support <b>18</b>. The topmost rim of the can, at the seam between the top cap and the can body, is the strongest and most non-deforming portion of the can. The upper can support <b>18</b> ring <b>19</b> which fits within, around, at, or onto the topmost seam or rim of the can provides the most stable force application platform for the apparatus <b>10</b> which is necessary for tab removal without incurring excessive travel of the force application handles <b>34</b>. That is, if the can deforms during tab removal, the handles <b>34</b> must incur a greater displacement relative to each other which may result in incomplete tab removal or a deformation of the can without tab removal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Utilization of a circular ring <b>19</b> upper can support <b>18</b> which substantially matches the inside diameter of a can mouth assures that the apparatus <b>10</b> centrally registers on the can top during tab removal. Removal of the can tab is best accomplished when the force applied to the tab is substantially perpendicular to the topmost surface of the can (i.e. top cap of the can). If the upper can support <b>18</b> intimately fits inside the can mouth, proper positioning of the lower fork <b>14</b> is assured during tab removal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The preferred embodiment of the present art apparatus <b>10</b> utilizes a substantially half spherical form <b>20</b>, spherical cap, hemispherical, or dome shaped portion attached with the upper pivot arm <b>16</b> with the equator of the sphere <b>20</b>, cap, or dome forming said circular ring <b>19</b>. The pole of said half spherical form <b>20</b> is positioned substantially opposite said circular ring <b>19</b> and said lower fork <b>14</b> when the apparatus <b>10</b> is assembled. It is recognized that a substantial portion of the half sphere may be removed or be void of material without affecting the form or function of the circular ring <b>19</b>. Nevertheless, by utilizing the substantially half sphere <b>20</b>, the circular ring <b>19</b> is supported around the circumference and allows manufacture of the half sphere <b>20</b> or equivalent from a thinner material which may be formed from a die and punch. Alternative embodiments may utilize an upper can support <b>18</b> of any form which substantially retains the circular ring <b>19</b> form which mates with the can mouth or top. Further alternative embodiments may utilize an upper can support <b>18</b> which simply rests upon or substantially near a portion of the topmost seam of the can in the form of a circular ring or simply an extension from the upper pivot arm <b>24</b>. Yet further alternative embodiments may utilize a circular ring <b>19</b> which is only partially circular or arcuate and is sized to mate or rest interior to, exterior to, or on the mouth seam.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the preferred embodiment, a slot <b>22</b> is formed into the half sphere <b>20</b> which provides clearance for the lower pivot arm <b>16</b>. That is, when the apparatus <b>10</b> is registered with a can top and each handle <b>34</b> displaced toward the other handle <b>34</b> the lower pivot arm <b>16</b> intersects the outline of the substantially half sphere <b>20</b> which would prohibit further displacement and tab removal if the slot <b>22</b> were not present. The width of said slot <b>22</b> must be greater than the thickness of the lower pivot arm <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The lower pivot arm <b>16</b> and upper pivot arm <b>24</b> are each shaped to attach with the lower fork <b>14</b> and upper can support <b>18</b> respectively without interference with the other components of the apparatus <b>10</b> during use. Although a plurality of forms and shapes are contemplated, as shown, the lower pivot arm <b>16</b> is a substantially triangular form with a distal vertex attached with the lower fork and proximal portion attached with a first of said handles <b>34</b>. Also as shown, the upper pivot arm <b>24</b> is of a compound form with a distal portion substantially matching the outline of the upper can support <b>18</b> and a proximal portion connecting with the a second of said handles <b>34</b> positioned opposite the first of said handles <b>34</b>. Each of the pivot arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> in combination with the corresponding first and second handles <b>34</b> respectively are two separate assemblies which are pivotally connected at said pivot <b>26</b>. Alternative embodiments may utilize a plurality of forms and shapes for the pivot arms <b>16</b>,<b>24</b>, including but not limited to bar stock, forged or cast arms, or ridged sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, the lower and upper pivot arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> each have a hole through which a pivot <b>26</b>, preferably comprising a shaft <b>28</b>, is located. The shaft <b>28</b> is preferably in the form of a headed screw with accompanying nut which pivotally sandwiches the arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> together. Alternative embodiments may utilize a plurality of pivot forms, including but not limited to rivets, headed shafts, or pins as a substitution for said shaft <b>28</b>. Further alternative embodiments may integrally form said shaft <b>28</b> with one or more of said arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although not essential to operation, the preferred embodiment utilizes a torsion spring <b>30</b> having one or more spring arms <b>32</b> in order to provide a return or opening bias to the head apparatus <b>12</b>. The preferred embodiment attaches or mates the spring arms <b>32</b> with the handles <b>34</b> although alternative embodiments may attach to or mate the spring arms <b>32</b> with the pivot arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>. For the preferred embodiment, the each of the spring arms <b>32</b> insert into a tubular support <b>36</b> formed as a portion of the handle <b>34</b>. To provide said bias, further alternative embodiments may utilize compression or other types of springs between the handles <b>34</b> or arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>. Alternative embodiments may seat or retain said spring arms <b>32</b> via posts, retainers, clips, or other retention methods with said pivot arms <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> or said handles <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tubular support <b>36</b>, although also not essential to operation, fits over and is attached to a portion of each handle <b>34</b> and provides a substantially circular cross sectional form which comfortably fits the palm of the user. The tubular support <b>36</b> form also allows a tubular grip material to be fitted over the support <b>36</b> whereby a secure and comfortable feel is provided to the user. Alternative embodiments may utilize a partially tubular or partial circular cross section support <b>36</b> which is attached with said handles.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, the user first inserts the lower fork <b>14</b> between the tab and can top. That is, the fork slot <b>15</b> surrounds the tab holding post <b>40</b> on the can top and the tab extension or attachment arm <b>42</b>. The handles <b>34</b> are then displaced or squeezed whereby the upper can support <b>18</b> mates with the can top inside or at the seam at the can top. A slightly increased force is further applied whereby the tab is removed from the can top with a &#x201c;pop&#x201d; like report. The tab is then removed from a top surface of the fork <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">From the foregoing description, those skilled in the art will appreciate that all objects of the present invention are realized. A pop tab remover apparatus and method of use is shown and described. The apparatus and method of use allows adults and children to quickly and easily remove tabs from aluminum or other types of cans with a minimal amount of application force. The apparatus and method of use further provides an amusing pastime in support of a user's charity of choice.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Having described the invention in detail, those skilled in the art will appreciate that modifications may be made of the invention without departing from its spirit. Therefore, it is not intended that the scope of the invention be limited to the specific embodiments illustrated and described. Rather, it is intended that the scope of this invention be determined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
