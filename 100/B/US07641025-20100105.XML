<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a disc brake, particularly for commercial vehicles, having a caliper straddling a brake disc, an electromechanically or pneumatically operable application device arranged in the caliper for applying the brake, and at least one adjusting device with an electric-motor drive for compensating brake pad wear by adjusting the release play of the disc brake. In particular, the disc brake has at least one electric-motor-driven adjusting rotating device on each side of the brake disc, each of which act by way of at least one pressure piece upon a respective brake pad on each side of the brake disc.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disc brakes with adjusting systems operated by an electric motor are known per se; such as, for example, from German Patent documents DE 197 56 519 A1 and DE 37 16 202 A1 or International Patent document WO 99/05428.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of an electric adjusting motor for driving the adjusting device of the disc brake has been successful per se. In comparison to normal mechanical wear adjusting systems, disc brakes with an electromechanical adjusting device have the advantage that an unacceptably reduced release play (for example, as a result of a thermal expansion of the brake pads) can be augmented again by rotating back the adjusting rotating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the event of a servicing, the adjusting rotating devices can advantageously be returned automatically into their initial position by means of the electronic control of the adjusting device, thus allowing for the replacement of the worn-out brake pads with new ones.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, this basic advantage of the electromechanical wear adjusting systems has the problem that it must be designed to preclude the initiation of an unacceptably large resetting as a result of an error in the hardware or software of the electronic control system or by an external influence on the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although, because of a correspondingly error-tolerant construction of the electronic control system and of the pertaining software, the occurrence of this error can be considered to be virtually excluded, additional protection measures are required because of the serious consequences of this error in the event of any, however improbable, occurrence.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop the disc brake of the above-mentioned type such that an unacceptably large reversed rotation of the adjusting rotating devices is reliably prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention achieves this task by providing a mechanical device for blocking the electric-motor-driven adjusting setting devices with respect to an augmentation of the release play by the electric-motor drive which exceeds a limit value.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageous further developments are described and claimed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, the disc brake has a mechanically operating device that blocks the electric-motor-driven adjusting devices&#x2014;for example, adjusting rotating devices or drives&#x2014;with respect to a threshold-exceeding augmentation (increase) of the release play by the electric-motor drive. Completely independent of operations in the electronic system (such as an ABS or EBS control unit of the brake), it therefore becomes possible that, during the normal operation of the brake, a reversed rotation, for example, of the adjusting rotating devices beyond a certain permissible amount is prevented by a mechanical blocking of the adjusting devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention is particularly suitable for a disc brake, in which at least one adjusting device, respectively, is arranged on each side of the brake disc so that, for compensating brake pad wear, the brake pads on both sides of the brake disc can be adjusted. In this case, the adjusting device(s) can each have at least one or two adjusting rotating device(s).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The blocking forces of the blocking device are preferably proportioned to be at least large enough so that the electric motor drive, or the drives of the adjusting device, cannot overcome the blocking forces and are maintained immobile with respect to the maximal driving torque. As a result, an unintended augmentation of the release play is reliably avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During servicing, the blocking of the adjusting devices is temporarily canceled in order to permit the setting-back of the screws to allow for the exchanging of the brake pads.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The mechanical blockage of the reversed rotation can occur at the driving motors themselves, in the adjusting gearing, or at the adjusting rotating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The blocking by way of the adjusting rotating devices is particularly advantageously achieved in that the adjusting rotating devices are connected with the brake pads for transmitting pull-back forces, and the brake pads are mutually coupled such that, although they can be moved toward one another by the adjusting system in the event of the occurrence of wear, a mutual moving-apart of the brake pads is permitted only to a predefined extent.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a supplementary fashion, an electronically acting device can be provided for blocking the electric-motor-driven adjusting setting device(s) with respect to an unintentional augmentation of the release play by the electric-motor drive&#x2014;for example, designed as a corresponding controlling and/or regulating process for controlling the adjusting devices&#x2014;so that the mechanical blocking device only represents a fall-back (fail-safe) device in the event of a failure of the electronic blocking device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mechanical blocking device can be implemented in an uncomplicated manner in various fashions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mechanical device for blocking the electric-motor-driven adjusting device is preferably implemented by a mechanical reversed-rotation blocking at the electric-motor drive, particularly at a driving motor, on a gearing, or on the adjusting rotating devices. In this case, it is particularly contemplated to construct the reversed-rotation blocking on the adjusting rotating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, a free wheel is arranged on a shaft end of the respective driving motor, which free wheel permits a rotating movement of the driving motor in the application direction of the adjusting rotating device, but has a blocking effect in the reversed-rotation direction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to permit a slight reversing of the adjusting rotating devices, according to a variant, the housing of the free wheel can be connected with an elastic element, such as a flat coil spring. In this manner, when the motor shaft is moved by a reversed rotation, the flat coil spring is first wound up by way of, optionally, several rotations before a further rotation of the motor shaft is prevented by means of the free wheel and the pretensioned flat coil spring acting upon the latter. The outer end of the flat coil spring is connected with the caliper and can be uncoupled therefrom. For changing the brake pads, the fixing of the outer end of the flat coil spring can be released by a manual operation, so that a reversed rotation of the adjusting rotating devices is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Instead of using the flat coil spring, a limited reversing can also be achieved by combining a free wheel with a screwing element. In this case, the housing of the free wheel is axially displaceably but non-rotatably accommodated in a sleeve which has an external thread on its outside diameter, with which external thread, it engages with an internal thread in the caliper.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the free wheel now locks during a reversed-rotating movement of the engine shaft, the free wheel rotates the outer sleeve into the internal thread receiving it and, in the process, moves this sleeve in the axial direction by way of, optionally, several rotations against a stop. When the stop has been reached, a further rotating movement is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The two above-described reversed-rotation securing mechanisms, as well as contemplated equivalent embodiments thereof, in the same manner as on the motor shaft, can be arranged on each shaft of the adjusting gearing connected on the output side. Corresponding to the ratio to the shaft of the driving motor, a smaller angle of rotation is required while the adjusting forces are correspondingly larger.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further preferred manner, the pressure pieces are connected with pad holding plates.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This solution utilizes the fact that the adjusting pistons for achieving an active release of the brake pads after the braking operation are mechanically coupled with the respectively acted-upon brake pad in the sense of a transmission of a reversing movement. This mechanical coupling can take place in a form-locking manner (for example, mutually engaging profiles of the pressure element and of the back of the brake pad), in a material-locking manner (gluing, welding, etc.) or in a force-locking manner (for example, by way of clamp springs).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the two brake pads are now mutually connected by way of a second coupling device such that, although they can be moved toward one another for the purpose of the wear adjustment, a moving-apart is prevented starting from a predefined amount in the second coupling device, the adjusting rotating devices of the internal as well as of the external adjusting device are thereby blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As mentioned above, a blocking of the screws can be implemented by way of coupled brake pads. In a particularly preferred manner, the two brake pads are coupled with one another in a constructively simpler and more cost-effective fashion such that, for the purpose of the wear adjustment, they can be moved toward one another but can be moved away from one another only by not more than a small predefined amount. In this manner, the brake pads are mutually coupled such that, although in the event of an occurrence of wear, the brake pads can be moved toward one another by means of the adjusting device on both sides of the brake disc, a moving-apart of the brake pads is permitted only by way of a predefined path.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The brake pad holding device oftentimes consists of a brake pad holding clamp which extends at a right angle with respect to the friction surfaces of the brake disc beyond the latter and the brake pads and is supported at both ends on the caliper. The brake pad holding clamp presses the two brake pads by way of the brake pad holding springs placed upon these brake pads against the supporting surfaces in the brake pad guide of the caliper. The coupling device can therefore be constructed on a brake pad holding clamp, which extends at a right angle with respect to the friction surfaces of the brake disc beyond the latter and the brake pads and is supported at both ends on the caliper. The brake pad holding clamp presses the two brake pads by way of the brake pad holding spring placed upon the latter against the supporting surfaces in the brake pad guide of the caliper. In this manner, a particularly secure blocking device is implemented in a particularly cost-effective fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The brake pad holding clamp is, preferably, axially moveably accommodated in abutments at the caliper, and/or, on its surface facing the brake pads is equipped with a profiling, particularly with a saw-toothed profile, in the areas in which the brake pad holding springs are supported against the brake pad holding clamp. The additional costs of the construction as a result of the construction of the blocking device are kept particularly low in this manner while the operating reliability is excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The profiling preferably has two profiling sections oriented in opposite directions, so that a displacing of the brake pads in the direction of the brake disc can take place with relatively little force, whereas a moving-away of the brake pads from the brake disc can be implemented only by means of a greater force as a result of the profilings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Projections engaging in the profiling are preferably constructed on the brake pad holding springs, and the brake pad holding springs are received with an axial play on the brake pads.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment of the invention, the brake pad holding clamp is axially movably received in its abutments at the caliper; for example, with an axial displaceability of approximately 2 mm. By means of a controlling of the internal and external adjusting devices in opposite directions, it becomes possible in this manner to push the entire unit consisting of the brake disc and brake pad holding clamp/brake pad set back and forth in this area without changing the total release play and the claw-type connection between the brake pad holding clamp and the brake pad holding springs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is also contemplated that the profiled sections are arranged in a component that is itself arranged between the brake pad holding clamp and the brake pad holding springs. The component is displaceable relative to the brake pad holding clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This function is important in the case of fixed-caliper brakes with an external wear adjustment and a micro-displaceable brake disc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the invention are also contemplated in which the second coupling device is constructed to be separate, that is, not combined with the brake pad holding device. For example, the brake pads can be coupled by way of a cylinder-piston element, in which case the cylinder (or the two cylinders) is fastened to the first brake pad, and the piston (or the two pistons) is fastened to the brake pad which is, in each case, situated opposite the brake disc. Here, the piston end can be equipped with elastic projections which engage in corresponding profilings, such as circling sawtooth grooves in the internal cylinder surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, preferably a continuously operating reversed-rotation securing mechanism can also be created by means of the cylinder-piston combination. This can be implemented by means of clamping mechanisms which, in principle, operate similarly to the described mechanical locking. However, preferably, a free wheel is arranged on the pin-shaped end of the piston, which free wheel carries a non-self-locking thread on its enveloping housing, which thread engages in a complementary internal thread in the cylinder. The free wheel is accommodated in a secured manner on the piston pin for transmitting axial forces. The locking direction of the free wheel is selected such that the brake pads can be moved toward one another at a relatively low expenditure of force. However, the free wheel locks when the brake pads are moving apart, so that no relative movement takes place in the thread. A slight reverse movement is permitted by a play in the thread or in the axial securing of the free wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Advantageous further developments of the invention are described and claimed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the following, the invention will be explained in detail with reference to the attached figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">First, the basic construction of the disc brake according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described in order to explain an exemplary construction of a disc brake with electromagnetically operated adjusting devices on both faces of the brake disc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a sliding-caliper disc brake having a caliper, which here consists of one piece, that overlaps a brake disc <b>1</b>. As an alternative, the invention can also be used with fixed-caliper disc brakes or with hinged-caliper disc brakes. It is also particularly suitable for pneumatically operated brakes (with a pneumatically operated cylinder) or also for purely mechanically operated brakes where, under certain circumstances, the adjusting device and the application device are combined with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As an alternative, the caliper <b>3</b> can also be constructed in two parts (not illustrated here). In this case, the two caliper parts are then preferably mutually connected by studs, and preferably one of the two caliper parts frames the brake disc in its upper circumferential area, and the other caliper part is used for receiving the application device, which permits a simple adaptation of the brake to many different types of application devices.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">On one side of the brake disc <b>1</b>, an application device <b>5</b> is arranged in the caliper <b>3</b>, which application device <b>5</b> can be inserted (also completely or partially preassembled) into the caliper <b>3</b> through an opening <b>7</b> of the caliper <b>3</b> that faces toward the brake disc.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The application device <b>5</b> has a rotary lever <b>9</b>, which can be operated by a piston rod (not shown here). The rotary lever <b>9</b> is supported on the caliper <b>3</b> by way of bearing elements, such as balls, which are not visible, and additional bearing shells.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">On its side facing away from the caliper <b>3</b>, the rotary lever <b>9</b> in each case acts upon an intermediate element <b>11</b> at a central point or, preferably, at two lateral ends. The intermediate element <b>11</b> has a hemispherical attachment <b>13</b> at its end facing the rotary lever. A slide bearing shell <b>14</b> is arranged between the attachment <b>13</b> and the rotary lever <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The intermediate element <b>11</b> is supported on the face of an adjusting nut <b>15</b> into which an adjusting screw <b>17</b> is inserted, in particular it is screwed in. The adjusting screw <b>17</b> carries a pressure piece <b>19</b> at its end facing away from the rotary lever <b>9</b>, which pressure piece rests on a brake pad holding plate <b>21</b> of an application-side brake pad <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the rotary lever <b>9</b> is swivelled by advancing the piston rod (not visible here), the lower eccentric-type end of the rotary lever <b>9</b> causes an advancing movement of the intermediate element <b>11</b> in the direction of the brake disc <b>1</b>. In this case, the adjusting nut <b>15</b> and the adjusting screw <b>17</b> are also pressed in the direction of the brake pad <b>23</b>, and the application-side brake pad <b>23</b> is displaced in the direction of the brake disc <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The adjusting nut <b>15</b> and the adjusting screw <b>17</b> are inserted into two holding plates <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>. A bellows-type seal <b>29</b> seals-off the space between the one holding plate <b>25</b> and the pressure piece to prevent penetration of dirt and moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A gearwheel <b>31</b> is fastened on the adjusting nut in a non-rotatable manner relative to the adjusting nut. The gearwheel can be operated by way of additional gearing members, such as additional gearwheels (in particular, by an electric motor not illustrated here), in order to compensate the brake pad wear caused by braking.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the adjusting nut <b>15</b> is rotated, the adjusting screw <b>17</b> is moved axially relative to the adjusting nut <b>15</b> and the release play between the brake pad and the brake disc is thereby changed. As an alternative, a like operation by way of a coupling mechanism (not shown here) connected between the rotary lever <b>9</b> and the adjusting nut <b>15</b> is also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, two of the adjusting rotating devices <b>16</b>&#x2014;consisting of the adjusting nut <b>15</b> and the adjusting screw <b>17</b>&#x2014;are arranged side-by-side on each side of the application device <b>5</b>, so that the brake lining is pressed at two points.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Two additional adjusting rotating devices <b>16</b> with a, preferably, separate electric-motor drive are arranged on the side of the brake disc <b>1</b> facing away from the application device&#x2014;the so-called &#x201c;reaction side&#x201d;&#x2014;in the caliper <b>3</b>. These adjusting rotating devices <b>16</b> also each have an adjusting nut <b>15</b> and an adjusting screw <b>17</b>, which permit the displacing of the pressure piece <b>19</b> in the direction of the brake pad <b>33</b>, which is arranged on the reaction side of the brake disc <b>1</b>, in the direction of the brake disc <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The adjusting of the release play preferably takes place in a computer-controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since at least one separate adjusting device (here, in each case, the adjusting device includes two adjusting rotating devices with an electric-motor drive) is arranged on each face of the brake disc <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to construct the caliper <b>3</b> here as a sliding or hinged caliper. Such a caliper can have a sliding path or swivelling angle dimensioned such that less than the maximal adjusting path, particularly even only the maximal working stroke can be bridged by the sliding path or swiveling angle when the brake is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For this purpose, the caliper <b>3</b> is swivellably or slidably fastened relative to a wheel axle (or wheel hub relative to the latter) on an elastic bearing. In a supplementary fashion, the brake disc <b>1</b> can also be slidably fastened to the wheel axle or wheel hub. Since the sliding path or swivelling angle to be bridged is smaller that the sliding path or the swivelling angle which a comparable caliper according to the state of the art had to bridge (in the case of which an adjusting device was arranged only on one side of the brake disc), it surprisingly becomes possible to implement the slidability or the swivellability by an elastic linkage between the caliper and the wheel hub or wheel axle.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this case, the elastic bearing is arranged parallel to the axis of symmetry of the brake disc. This means that essentially no swivelling movement takes place about a bearing axis of rotation, but rather an elastic longitudinal displacement of the caliper takes place with an elastic swivellability transversely to the longitudinal axis of the ultra-bush, which ultra-bush can be used here, for example, as the bearing. Here, the movement of the caliper for compensating the elasticity is not implemented exclusively as a swivelling movement, whereby particularly adaptation braking takes place with an almost pure longitudinal displacement of the caliper, and only the rarely occurring braking at high braking forces requires the swivelling of the caliper. As an alternative, two bearings with swivelling axes parallel to the disc axis of rotation (not shown here) can also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is important here that the adjusting devices are driven by electric motors; for example, by electric motors between two rotating screws on each side of the brake disc or outside the caliper, which are connected with the rotary drives by way of a driving connection not shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the upper circumferential area of the brake disc <b>1</b>, in addition to the brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> arranged on both sides of the brake disc <b>1</b>. The brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> each consist of brake pad material <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>a </i>and brake pad holding plates <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>. Two pressure pieces <b>19</b> arranged on both sides of the brake disc <b>1</b> in each case act upon the brake pad holding plates <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>33</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the installed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the brake pads are slid from above into brake pad shafts <b>37</b> of the disc brake. At their corresponding upper edge, the brake pad holding plates have two holding projections <b>39</b><i>a, b </i>for mounting a brake pad holding spring <b>41</b>. In this case, the brake pad holding springs <b>41</b> are secured on both sides of the brake disc <b>1</b> by a brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> oriented perpendicular to the brake disc plane to prevent them from falling out of the caliper opening in which the brake pads are slid (for the basic function of elements <b>39</b> to <b>41</b>, see also European Patent document EP 0 534 987 B1).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> arranged at the caliper, for example, disposed or fastened, is provided with a sawtooth-type profiling on its side which is at the bottom in the installed position. This profiling <b>45</b> comprises two sawtooth-type profiling sections <b>45</b><i>a, b</i>, which are oriented in opposite directions with respect to one another. Projections <b>47</b> of the brake pad holding spring <b>41</b> engage in the profiling <b>45</b> such that a displacement of the brake pads can take place with the sawtooth profile, but not against the sawtooth profile. The combination of sawtooth profilings <b>45</b> and projections <b>47</b> thereby forms the mechanically operative device for blocking the electric-motor-driven adjusting setting devices with respect to an unintended augmenting of the release play by the electric-motor drive.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">On its surface facing the brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b>, the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> is provided with a profiling <b>45</b> in the areas in which the brake pad holding springs <b>41</b> are supported against the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the contact area to the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b>, the brake pad holding springs <b>41</b> have projections <b>47</b> or profilings, which are opposed to the profilings in the brake pad holding clamp, so that these profilings are pressed into one another under the pretensioning force of the brake pad holding springs (not shown here). The profilings are designed such that displacement of the brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> in the direction of the brake disc <b>1</b> can take place at a relatively low force, whereas a moving-away of the brake pads from the brake disc <b>1</b> is prevented by the mutually engaging profilings <b>45</b> of the brake pad holding clamp and the brake pad holding springs (not shown) (ratchet principle).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A slight movement of the brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> away from the brake disc <b>1</b> is preferably permitted in that the brake pad holding springs <b>41</b> are accommodated on the brake pads <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> with a certain axial play.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">This variant of the invention can be implemented in a particularly cost-effective manner but is nevertheless operationally reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 10</figref>, the profiling <b>45</b> is not provided in the brake pad clamp <b>43</b> itself, but rather in a component <b>49</b> in the form of a sectionally U-shaped metal strip which is arranged between the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> and the brake pad holding springs <b>41</b> and frames the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b>. This metal strip reaches around the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> on its side which is on the bottom in the installed position, as well as laterally and, in sections, by means of two holding noses <b>51</b> also on the top side. In this case, the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b> can be fixedly mounted on the caliper <b>3</b>, and the axial displacing movement takes place between this additional component <b>49</b> and the brake pad holding clamp <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the brake pad is exchanged, the reversed-rotation blocking is eliminated again by the releasing of the brake pad holding clamp, which has to be released anyhow during the exchange. In the case of other implementations of the reversed rotation protection, a corresponding manual release mechanism is to be provided for releasing the blocking.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate examples for implementing a device for blocking the electric-motor-driven adjusting device by way of a mechanical reversed-rotation blocking at the electric motor drive, particularly at a driving motor <b>53</b> of the drive.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">EC motors are illustrated in each case, which are arranged in recesses <b>55</b> of a brake housing or caliper <b>3</b>, the recesses <b>55</b> being closed toward the outside by an end shield <b>57</b> and a cover <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The EC motor includes a stator <b>61</b> with solenoids <b>63</b>, as well as a rotor <b>65</b> with a permanent magnet <b>67</b>. A slide bearing <b>69</b> is provided in which a shaft <b>71</b> is arranged. The shaft <b>71</b> has a driving pinion <b>73</b> for driving the adjusting device connected on the output side, for example, in the manner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For implementing the mechanical reversed-rotation blocking <b>75</b>, at the end of the shaft <b>71</b> facing away from the driving pinion <b>73</b>, this shaft <b>71</b> is surrounded by a clamp roller free wheel <b>77</b>, which is arranged at the inside end of a flat coil or flat coil spring <b>79</b>. The flat coil or flat coil spring <b>79</b> is fastened by means of a dowel pin <b>84</b> on the outer end on the end shield <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thus, the path of the reversed rotation of the shaft <b>71</b> and, thus, also the path of the reversing of the adjusting devices is limited in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in that an external thread is arranged on one end of a free wheel housing <b>83</b> of the clamp roller free wheel <b>77</b>, which external thread meshes with the internal thread of a hexagon nut <b>85</b>, which is non-rotatably but axially displaceably arranged on the thread <b>83</b> because it is arranged in a corresponding internal thread in a recess <b>87</b> of the end shield <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Since here the displacement path of the hexagon nut is limited by the free wheel in combination with the dimensions of the recess <b>87</b> in the end shield <b>57</b>, a mechanical reversed-rotation blocking <b>75</b> is also implemented in a simple manner.</p>
