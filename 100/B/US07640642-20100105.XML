<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a machine tool apparatus for machining a machining object using a tool by controlling the relative position between the tool and the machining object held by a jig.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are conventional machine tools in which a controller ascertains the positional information of a tool and a machining object that is specified by a coordinate value, and the controller drives a drive motor housed in the machine tool on the basis of the positional information, whereby the tool and the machining object are moved and machining is carried out (e.g., see Patent Document 1)</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2005-313239 (Page 5, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>)</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the machine tool described in Patent Document 1 has a problem in that the time for stopping the machine tool is extended and the utilization ratio of the machine tool is reduced because, in general, when the machining object designed to be machined is mounted on a jig and machined, the machine tool must be stopped each time the machining object is machined, the machined object must be dismounted from the jig fixed at the machining position in which the machining object is to be machined by the tool, an unfinished machining object must be mounted on the jig, and time is required in the mounting/dismounting work for switching out the machining object.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention was contrived in view of the foregoing problems, and an object is to provide a machine tool that can reduce the time for stopping the work of machining a machining object, and that can improve the utilization ratio in the work of machining a machining object using a machine tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above-described problems, the machine tool apparatus according to a first aspect of the present invention is an apparatus for machining a machining object using a tool by controlling the relative position between the tool and the machining object held in a jig, the machine tool apparatus characterized in that:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">the jig comprises at least a first jig disposed in a machining position of the machining object disposed inside a case of the machine tool apparatus, and a second jig which is moveably configured so as to be separate from the first jig and in which the machining object is detachably held;</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">the first jig and the second jig have mounting/dismounting means for detachably mounting the second jig on the first jig, and the second jig is provided with a handle for gripping when the second jig is to be moved; and</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">the case is provided with an aperture for loading and unloading the jig from the exterior of the case to the machining position, a guidance pathway for moving and guiding the second jig in substantially the horizontal direction is provided between at least the machining position and the aperture, and the second jig can be moved along the guidance pathway in a state in which the handle is held.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with this aspect, the user can easily move the second jig between the aperture of the case and the machining position by merely gripping the handle and applying a force in the horizontal direction in order to move and guide the second jig in the horizontal direction via the guidance pathway. The machining object is removed from inside the case together with the second jig after machining has ended, whereupon a new second jig that is separate from the second jig on which the machining object is mounted in advance can be mounted instead on the first jig, i.e., in the machining position. Therefore, the utilization ratio of the machine tool apparatus can thereby be effectively improved because the work for mounting and dismounting the machining object is not required to be performed in the machining position, and the time for stopping the work for machining the machining object can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The machine tool apparatus according to a second aspect of the present invention is the machine tool apparatus according to the first aspect, characterized in that:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">the guidance pathway is composed of a rail member; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">the second jig has an engagement groove that engages the rail member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with this aspect, the second jig can be moved without shaking along the rail member. Therefore, the first and second jigs can be easily positioned when the second jig is mounted on the first jig.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The machine tool apparatus according to a third aspect of the present invention is the machine tool apparatus according to the first or second aspect, characterized in that: the guidance pathway is provided with a plurality of rollers that are brought into contact with the second jig.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0099">Three clamp rings <b>34</b> that constitute the concavities of the present invention and are connected to the three clamp devices <b>17</b> described above are provided to the bottom surface of the work palettes <b>14</b>, and the clamp rings <b>34</b> are connected to the clamp devices <b>17</b>, whereby the work palettes <b>14</b> are mounted on the clamp palette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0100">The work palettes <b>14</b> in the present embodiment are formed using aluminum, duralumin, or another lightweight metal material in order to reduce the weight of the work palettes, and lightening holes <b>36</b> for reducing weight are formed in a plurality of locations in the bottom surface of the work palettes <b>14</b>. Each of the work palettes <b>14</b> of the present embodiment is formed so that the weight is 15 kg or less, and the palettes have a weight and size that allows the work palettes to be easily carried by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0101">The clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b> will be described next. A piston rod <b>38</b> urged downward by a clamp spring <b>37</b> is provided to the clamp devices <b>17</b>, and the piston rod <b>38</b> is moved upward by the pressure of the hydraulic fluid fed from the hydraulic fluid supply tube <b>39</b> to the lower surface of the piston rod <b>38</b> in a state in which the work palettes <b>14</b> have been dismounted from the clamp palette <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0102">An air supply tube <b>40</b> is connected to the clamp devices <b>17</b>; compressed air fed from the air supply tube <b>40</b> is discharged from a discharge port <b>41</b> provided to the upper end portion of the piston rod <b>38</b> and from a gap <b>42</b> provided to the step portion of each of the clamp devices <b>17</b>; and grinding fluid, chips, and the like that adhere to the clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b> are removed by the discharged air.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0103">A controller (not shown) reduces the hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic fluid supplied from the hydraulic fluid supply tube <b>39</b> when the elevator rail members <b>18</b> are lowered and the clamp rings <b>34</b> make contact above the clamp devices <b>17</b> in the case that the work palettes <b>14</b> and the clamp palette <b>5</b> are connected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>). At this time, the piston rod <b>38</b> is lowered by the urging force of the clamp spring <b>37</b>, the upper portion of the clamp devices <b>17</b> is inserted into the clamp rings <b>34</b>, and the clamp devices <b>17</b> and clamp rings <b>34</b> fit each other.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0104">Balls <b>44</b> make contact with an inclined surface <b>43</b> formed on the side surface of the piston rod <b>38</b> at the same time that the piston rod <b>38</b> descends, and the balls <b>44</b> protrude outward from the clamp devices <b>17</b>. The protruding balls <b>44</b> engage an engagement portion <b>34</b>&#x2032; formed in the clamp rings <b>34</b>, and the clamp rings <b>34</b> and the clamp devices <b>17</b> are connected. The locations in which the engagement portion <b>34</b>&#x2032; and the balls <b>44</b> are provided to the clamp rings <b>34</b> and the clamp devices <b>17</b> constitute fitting terminal portions of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0105">When the clamp rings and the clamp devices <b>17</b> are connected and held close to each other, the outflow of air from the discharge port <b>41</b> and the gap <b>42</b> stops, a sensor (not shown) disposed inside the air supply tube <b>40</b> senses that the outflow of the air has stopped, and a controller (not shown) actuates the drive motor <b>7</b> and the tool unit <b>4</b> on the basis of the sensing of the sensor (not shown) to start machining work.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0106">The piston rod <b>38</b> is moved upward by the hydraulic pressure, and the balls <b>44</b> move away from the inclined surface <b>43</b> of the piston rod <b>38</b>, when the hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic fluid supplied from the hydraulic fluid supply tube <b>39</b> is increased in the case that the connection state between the work palettes <b>14</b> and the clamp palette <b>5</b> is released. Therefore, the balls <b>44</b> are accommodated inside the clamp devices <b>17</b>, the engagement state between the balls <b>44</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b> is released, and the work palettes <b>14</b> are dismounted from the clamp palette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0107">Application examples of the NC machine tool <b>1</b> are described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 11</figref>. First, the user moves the palette guide <b>13</b> so that one of the work palettes <b>14</b> holding a workpiece <b>8</b>, among the two left and right work palettes <b>14</b> mounted on the palette guide <b>13</b>, is disposed at the front surface of the fixed rail members <b>22</b>, i.e., the retracted position &#x3b1;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The user U grips the handles <b>32</b> of one of the work palettes <b>14</b> disposed in the retracted position &#x3b1;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and presses the work palettes <b>14</b> into the interior of the case <b>2</b> while sliding [the work palettes] on the fixed rail members <b>22</b> and the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In other words, the work palettes <b>14</b> are moved horizontally to the machining position while being guided by the fixed rail members <b>22</b> and the elevator rail members <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0108">A plurality of rollers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> is disposed on the fixed rail members <b>22</b> and the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, whereby the sliding friction generated between the fixed rail members <b>22</b>, the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> can be reduced during movement of the work palettes <b>14</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> are smoothly slid and moved on the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0109">When the work palettes <b>14</b> are mounted on the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, the elevator rail members <b>18</b> are inclined so as to slope downward to the rearward side, whereby the work palettes <b>14</b> mounted on the elevator rail members <b>18</b> move in the rearward direction (loading direction) by self-weight. The work palettes <b>14</b> stop moving when the rear end portion makes contact with the contact pieces <b>26</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> are positioned without backtracking because of the slope of the elevator rail members <b>18</b>. In other words, positioning can be reliably carried out because the work palettes <b>14</b> are held in a state of pressed contact against the contact pieces <b>26</b> even if the user releases the handles <b>32</b> of the work palettes <b>14</b> in the stopped position in which the rear end portions of the work palettes <b>14</b> are in contact with the contact pieces <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0110">The work palettes <b>14</b> slide while the engagement grooves <b>33</b> provided to the bottom surface are in engagement with the fixed rail members <b>22</b> and the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, whereby the work palettes <b>14</b> are guided and moved without shaking in the left/right direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and the rear end portions of the work palettes <b>14</b> make contact with the contact pieces <b>26</b>. The clamp rings <b>34</b> provided to the bottom surface of the work palettes <b>14</b> are thereby positioned above the clamp devices <b>17</b> provided to the upper surface of the clamp palette <b>5</b>. The elevator rail members <b>18</b> for guiding the work palettes <b>14</b> are provided as far as the area above the clamp palette <b>5</b>, whereby the work palettes <b>14</b> can be reliably guided to the machining position.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0111">The machining work is started when the user U operates the control panel <b>10</b> after the work palettes <b>14</b> have been positioned above the clamp palette <b>5</b>. The controller (not shown) drives the actuator <b>21</b> and lowers the elevator rail members <b>18</b> on the basis of the operation of the control panel <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b> described above are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0112">The position of the work palette <b>14</b> when the rear end portion of the work palette <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> makes contact with the contact piece <b>26</b> is the upper position of the first jig of the present invention. The elevator rail members <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are lowered, and the position in which the clamp ring <b>34</b> and the clamp device <b>17</b> are connected is the fitting position of the convexity and concavity of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0113">The controller (not shown) actuates the drive motor <b>7</b> and the tool unit <b>4</b> to start the machining work on the basis of the sensor (not shown) having sensed that the outflow of air from the gap <b>42</b> and the discharge port <b>41</b> of each of the clamp devices <b>17</b> described above has been stopped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The clamp palette <b>5</b> is rotated in the vertical direction by the driving of the drive motor <b>7</b>, and the upper surface as well as the front and back surfaces of the workpiece <b>8</b> are grinded by one of the drill tools <b>3</b> mounted in the tool unit <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0114">On the other hand, when the workpiece <b>8</b> held by one of the work palettes <b>14</b> is machined, the palette guide <b>13</b> is moved in the left/right direction so that the location in which the work palette <b>14</b> is placed is the standby position &#x3b2;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0115">The user connects the air hose <b>31</b> to the socket <b>30</b> of the palette guide <b>13</b> to push the chucks <b>27</b> upward, and mounts an unprocessed workpiece <b>8</b> on the other work palette <b>14</b>, which is on standby in the standby position &#x3b2;. When the air hose <b>31</b> is removed from the socket <b>30</b>, the chucks <b>27</b> are lowered, and the workpiece <b>8</b> is held on the work palette <b>14</b>. The user uses the time in which the workpiece <b>8</b> held on the work palette <b>14</b> is being machined to dismount or mount (exchange) a workpiece <b>8</b> on the other work palette <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0116">When the machining work of the workplace <b>8</b> held on one of the work palette <b>14</b> is completed, the controller (not shown) releases the connection between the clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b>, and the elevator rail members <b>18</b> are elevated. The work palette <b>14</b> is separated from the clamp palette <b>5</b> while the workplace <b>8</b> is retained in a held state. The user U grips the handles <b>32</b> of the work palette <b>14</b> disposed on the clamp palette <b>5</b>, i.e., in the machining position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and pulls forward and retracts the work palette <b>14</b> to the retracted position a on the palette guide <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0117">The user U moves the palette guide <b>13</b> in the left/right direction so that the other work palette <b>14</b> holding an unprocessed workpiece <b>8</b> is moved from the standby position &#x3b2; at the front surface of the fixed rail members <b>22</b>, i.e., to the retracted position &#x3b1;. The user U grips the handles <b>32</b> of the other work palette <b>14</b>, pushes the work palette <b>14</b> while slidably moving on the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>, moves the work palette <b>14</b> above the clamp palette <b>5</b>, and starts machining work in the same manner as with the first work palette <b>14</b> described above. The first work palette <b>14</b>, on which the machined workpiece <b>8</b> is held, is disposed in the standby position &#x3b2; at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0118">The user U connects the air hole <b>31</b> to the socket <b>30</b> of the first work palette <b>14</b>, pushes the chucks <b>27</b> upward, and removes the workpiece <b>8</b>. The user uses the time in which the workpiece <b>8</b> held on the other work palette <b>14</b> is being machined to dismount and mount the workpiece <b>8</b> by removing the machined workpiece <b>8</b> from the work palette <b>14</b> and mounting an unprocessed workpiece <b>8</b> on the work palette <b>14</b>. Workpieces <b>8</b> are thereafter sequentially machined while the actions described above are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0119">In the NC machine tool <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the work palette <b>14</b> is moved and guided in the horizontal direction by the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>. Therefore, the user can easily move the work palette <b>14</b> between the aperture S of the case <b>2</b> and the machining position by merely gripping the handle <b>32</b> and applying force in the horizontal direction, and the workpiece <b>8</b> is retracted from the machining position together with the work palette <b>14</b> after the machining of the workpiece <b>8</b> has ended, and a new work palette <b>14</b> that is separate from the work palette <b>14</b> on which the workpiece <b>8</b> is mounted in advance can be mounted instead on the clamp palette <b>5</b> disposed in the machining position. That is, rather than being mounted in the machining position as in the prior art, a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> can be mounted and dismounted in a retracted position a and in a standby position &#x3b2; provided separately from the machining position, and the work time for machining the workpiece <b>8</b> is thereby not divided by the work of mounting and dismounted the workpiece <b>8</b>. Therefore, the time in which the work of machining workpieces <b>8</b> is stopped can be minimized, and the utilization ratio of the NC machine tool <b>1</b> can thereby be effectively improved.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0120">In other words, when the workpiece <b>8</b> is exchanged in the machining position, time is required to perform the work of mounting and dismounting workpieces <b>8</b> to and from the work palettes <b>14</b> in the case that there is a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> as in the present embodiment. In contrast, the time needed to perform the mounting and dismounting work can be considerably reduced in the present invention because the work palettes <b>14</b>, which constitute the second jig, are merely mounted and dismounted from the clamp palette <b>5</b>, which constitute the first jig. In the particular case that there is a plurality of types of workpieces <b>8</b> to be machined, and the types of workpieces <b>8</b> to be machined are varied, the work palettes <b>14</b> as such are naturally exchanged in conjunction with the types of workpieces, and the mounting/dismounting mode of the workpiece <b>8</b> can also be varied. Therefore, the mounting/dismounting work carried out by the user U is in danger of decreasing. In contrast, sharing the work palettes <b>14</b> by a plurality of types of workpieces <b>8</b> prevents the efficiency of the mounting/dismounting work from being reduced even if the type of workpiece <b>8</b> to be machined is varied. This is because the work of mounting/dismounting the work palettes <b>14</b> to and from the clamp palette <b>5</b> does not change in accordance with the type of workpiece <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0121">The engagement groove <b>33</b> for engaging the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b> is formed on the work palette <b>14</b> to thereby allow the work palette <b>14</b> to move without shaking along the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>. Therefore, positioning between the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the work palette <b>14</b> is facilitated when the work palette <b>14</b> is mounted on the clamp palette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0122">A plurality of rollers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> that make contact with the work palette <b>14</b> is provided to the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and fixed rail members <b>22</b>, whereby frictional resistance is reduced when the work palette <b>14</b> moves along the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>. Therefore, the user can more easily move the work palettes <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0123">The clamp devices <b>17</b> are provided to the clamp palette <b>5</b>; the clamp rings <b>34</b> that fit onto the clamp devices <b>17</b> are provided to the work palettes <b>14</b>; and the work palettes <b>14</b> can be accurately positioned on the clamp palette <b>5</b> by mutually fitting the clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0124">The mounting function performed by the engagement portion <b>34</b>&#x2032; and the balls <b>44</b> is carried out after the fitting of the clamp devices <b>17</b> and the clamp rings <b>34</b> has been completed. The member for mounting/dismounting the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the work palettes <b>14</b>, as well as the member for positioning during mounting/dismounting, can thereby be used in combination. Therefore, not only can manufacturing costs be reduced, but mounting on the work palettes <b>14</b> can also be reliably carried out because the work palettes <b>14</b> are mounted on the clamp palette <b>5</b> after positioning has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0125">Elevator rail members <b>18</b> that elevate the work palette <b>14</b> are disposed between a position above of the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the fitting position of the clamp device <b>17</b> and the clamp ring <b>34</b>, whereby the work palette <b>14</b> is reliably guided by the elevator rail members to a position above the clamp palette <b>5</b>, and mounting is carried out by fitting the clamp device <b>17</b> and the clamp ring <b>34</b> in a state in which the work palette <b>14</b> remains mounted on the elevator rail members <b>18</b>. Therefore, the work palette <b>14</b> can be easily exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0126">In other words, in the present embodiment, the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the work palettes <b>14</b> are accurately positioned by the action of fitting the clamp devices <b>17</b> (convexities) and the clamp rings <b>34</b> (concavities). Therefore, the work palettes <b>14</b> must be lowered toward the clamp palette <b>5</b> after the work palettes <b>14</b> are moved horizontally from the retracted position &#x3b1; to a position above the clamp palette <b>5</b>. In other words, the work palettes <b>14</b> must be horizontally and elevatably moved between the retracted position &#x3b1; and the fitting position on the clamp palette <b>5</b>, but the movement between these points can be carried out in a state in which the palettes are being guided by the elevator rail members <b>18</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b>, which are all the rail members. Therefore, the user can manually move the work palettes <b>14</b> in a very simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0127">The elevator rail members <b>18</b> slope downward in the loading direction of the work palette <b>14</b>, and a contact piece <b>26</b> for stopping the work palettes <b>14</b>, which are moved and guided by the elevator rail members <b>18</b>, at a position above the clamp palette <b>5</b> is also provided. Accordingly, the contact piece <b>26</b> and the self-weight of the work palettes <b>14</b> operate together to position and stop the work palettes <b>14</b> in a position above the clamp palette <b>5</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> do not backtrack due to the slope of the elevator rail members <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0128">The mount <b>11</b> has a single retracted position a for retracting the work palettes <b>14</b> from the machining position, and also has at least two standby positions &#x3b2; for mounting and dismounting workpieces <b>8</b> to and from the work palettes <b>14</b> in relation to the retracted position a. Accordingly, a work palette <b>14</b> can be moved to a single standby position &#x3b2;, another work palette <b>14</b> waiting in another standby position &#x3b2; can be moved to the machining position via the retracted position &#x3b1;, and the work palettes <b>14</b> can be rapidly exchanged on the mount <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0129">The sliding surface <b>35</b>&#x2032; for sliding the work palettes <b>14</b> on the upper surface of the palette guide <b>13</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the work palettes <b>14</b>, and the upper surface of the palette guide <b>13</b> is positioned at substantially the same height as the fixed rail members <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the user can smoothly move the work palettes <b>14</b> between the palette guide <b>13</b> and the fixed rail members <b>22</b> by applying force to the work palettes <b>14</b> in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0130">In accordance with the NC machine tool <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the work palettes <b>14</b> are accurately positioned and connected by the clamp devices <b>17</b> (convexities) and the clamp rings <b>34</b> (concavities). Therefore, locating coordinates (centering) each time the work palettes <b>14</b> are exchanged is no longer required as long as the coordinates of the workpiece <b>8</b> or the work palettes <b>14</b> are located when the first workpiece <b>8</b> is machined, and the time in which the machining work of a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> is stopped can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0131">A single chuck <b>27</b> as a holding means for holding a plurality (three, in the present invention) of workpieces <b>8</b> is provided to the work palette <b>14</b>, and the work palette <b>14</b> is mounted on the clamp palette <b>5</b>. Accordingly, a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> can be disposed at one time on the clamp palette <b>5</b>, i.e., in the machining position during the mounting/dismounting work. For this reason, a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> can be disposed in the machining position in a shorter time than mounting and dismounting a plurality of workpieces <b>8</b> on the work palette <b>14</b> in the machining position, and the time during which the NC machine tool <b>1</b> is stopped can be shortened.</p>

Hereinbelow, the front side of the paper surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> will be referred to as the front surface (front side) of the NC machine tool <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0139">The NC machine tool <b>1</b><i>b </i>in embodiment 3 has a mount <b>11</b><i>a </i>provided to the surface in front of the case <b>2</b><i>b </i>in the same manner as in embodiment 2 described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The interior of the case <b>2</b><i>b </i>has a machining surface plate <b>47</b> that forms a flat surface at the same height as the upper surface of the plate member <b>45</b> of the mount <b>11</b><i>a</i>. In the present embodiment 3, the area in front of the aperture S on the upper surface of the plate member <b>45</b> constitutes a retracted position, and the areas to the left and right of the retracted position constitute standby positions.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0140">In the present embodiment 3, the machining surface plate <b>47</b> constitutes the first jig and guidance pathway of the present invention. Two clamp devices <b>17</b><i>b </i>as the convexities and the mounting/dismounting means of the present invention are disposed on the machining surface plate <b>47</b>, and the contact piece <b>26</b><i>b </i>as the stopping means of the present invention is erectly provided. The area surrounded by the contact piece <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the clamp devices <b>17</b><i>b </i>on the machining surface plate <b>47</b> constitutes the machining position of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0141">Work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>as the second jig of the present invention that have a cubic shape are mounted on the plate member <b>45</b> of the mount <b>11</b><i>a</i>. Fitting grooves <b>48</b> as the concavities and mounting/dismounting means of the present invention are provided to the left and right edges of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>so as to open upward. Handles <b>32</b><i>b</i>, which constitute the handle parts of the present invention for the user to grip, are provided to the front side edges of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0142">Balls <b>51</b> as the sliding parts of the present invention are disposed on the lower surface of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, allowing the user to slidably move the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>on the plate member <b>45</b> and the machining surface plate <b>47</b>. The clamp devices <b>17</b><i>b </i>have clamp parts <b>49</b> in which the plate-shaped member is bent so as to form substantially the shape of the letter &#x201c;C&#x201d; as viewed from the front surface, and the clamp parts <b>49</b> are moved in the vertical direction by actuators <b>50</b> disposed on the machining surface plate <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0143">When machining is to be performed, the user grips the handles <b>32</b><i>b </i>of a work palette <b>14</b><i>b </i>on the mount <b>11</b><i>a</i>, slidably moves the work palette <b>14</b><i>b </i>on the plate member <b>45</b> and the machining surface plate <b>47</b>, and positions the work palette <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the area surrounded by the contact piece <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the clamp devices <b>17</b><i>b </i>on the machining surface plate <b>47</b>, i.e., in the machining position. A controller (not shown) drives the actuators <b>50</b> and lowers the clamp parts <b>49</b>, whereby the clamp parts <b>49</b> fit into the fitting grooves <b>48</b>. At this point, the work palette <b>14</b><i>b </i>is secured in the machining position, and the work of machining the workpiece <b>8</b> by the tool unit <b>4</b> is started.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0144">As described above, in the present embodiment 3, a first jig and a guidance pathway are dually used as the machining surface plate <b>47</b>, and the machining surface plate <b>47</b> and the plate member <b>45</b> where the retracted position is disposed are at the same height. Therefore, the user can easily move the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>between the machining position and the retracted positions by merely applying a force to the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the horizontal direction. The guidance pathway of the present invention may be composed of a member for guiding at least the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the horizontal direction, and any member may be used as long as the user can grip the handles <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>and move [the work palettes] in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0145">Balls <b>51</b>, which serve as the sliding parts, are provided to the lower surface of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b</i>, thereby allowing the user to easily move even heavy work palettes <b>14</b><i>b</i>, for example. The sliding parts of the present invention are not limited to the balls <b>51</b>, and sliding resistance can be reduced when the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b </i>are moved by mounting rollers or wheels on the lower surface of the work palettes <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0146">Embodiments of the present invention were described above with reference to the diagrams, but the specific configuration is not limited to these embodiments, and variations and additions to the main points of the present invention that do not depart from the scope thereof are included in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0147">For example, in embodiment 1, a workpiece <b>8</b> was machined by mounting work palettes <b>14</b> in alternation with a single clamp palette <b>5</b> using two work palettes <b>14</b>, but machining may be carried out using a plurality of three or more work palettes <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0148">In the embodiments described above, a single work palette <b>14</b> was detachably mounted on a single clamp palette <b>5</b>, but a plurality of work palettes <b>14</b> may be detachably mounted above and below or to the left and right on a single clamp palette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0149">In the embodiments described above, the same type of workpiece <b>8</b> was held on a plurality of work palettes <b>14</b> and the controller established settings for performing the same machining for each of the workpieces <b>8</b>, but the present invention is not limited to this configuration, different types of workpieces <b>8</b> may be held on each of a plurality of work palettes <b>14</b>, and the controller may establish settings for performing different types of machining for each of the workpieces <b>8</b>. In such a configuration, different types of workpieces <b>8</b> can be machined using a single NC machine tool <b>1</b>, and different types of workpieces <b>8</b> can be sequentially loaded in a simple manner into the NC machine tool <b>1</b> because the work palettes <b>14</b> can be mounted and dismounted from the clamp palette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0150">In embodiment 1 described above, clamp devices <b>17</b> as convexities were provided to the clamp palette <b>5</b>, and clamp rings <b>34</b> as concavities fitted to the clamp devices <b>17</b> were provided to the work palettes <b>14</b>. However, a configuration is also possible in which the clamp rings <b>34</b> as concavities are provided to the clamp palette <b>5</b>, and the clamp devices <b>17</b> as convexities are provided to the work palettes <b>14</b>. The work palettes <b>14</b> can be accurately positioned in relation to the clamp palette <b>5</b> irrespective of whether the convexities or concavities are provided to either one of the clamp palette <b>5</b> and the work palettes <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0151">In embodiment 1 described above, an actuator <b>21</b> was driven as an elevator means, whereby the elevator rail members <b>18</b> were elevated or lowered to elevate or lower the work palettes <b>14</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> were mounted and dismounted from the clamp palette <b>5</b>. However, the mounting/dismounting of the work palettes <b>14</b> and the clamp palette <b>5</b> on the elevator rail members <b>18</b> can be carried out by elevating and lowering the clamp palette <b>5</b> without elevating or lowering the elevator rail members <b>18</b>. The clamp devices <b>17</b> of the clamp palette <b>5</b> are elevated or lowered without separately elevating and lowering the work palettes <b>14</b> and the clamp palette <b>5</b>, whereby the work palettes <b>14</b> can be mounted on and dismounted from the clamp rings <b>34</b>, and the work palettes <b>14</b> and the clamp palette <b>5</b> can be mutually mounted and dismounted.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0152">In the embodiments described above, a workpiece <b>8</b> was mounted on and dismounted from the work palettes <b>14</b> in a state in which the machined workpiece <b>8</b> is retracted onto the mount <b>11</b>, i.e., to the standby position &#x3b2;. However, it is not necessarily required that the workpiece <b>8</b> be mounted on and dismounted from the work palette <b>14</b> in the standby position &#x3b2; each time the machining of the workpiece <b>8</b> has ended. For example, the workpiece <b>8</b> may be mounted on and dismounted from the work palette <b>14</b> in the standby position &#x3b2; only when the type of work palette <b>14</b> is changed in accordance with the change in the type of workpiece <b>8</b> to be machined. When the type of workpiece <b>8</b> is not changed, a configuration is also possible in which the user puts his hand through the aperture S of the case <b>2</b> each time the machining of the workpiece <b>8</b> has ended, and the workpiece <b>8</b> is directly mounted on and dismounted from the work palette <b>14</b> disposed on the clamp palette <b>5</b> in the machining position, i.e., the workpiece <b>8</b> is mounted and dismounted in the machining position.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0153">In the embodiments described above, a numerically controlled NC machine tool <b>1</b> was used an example of a machine tool in which a controller (not shown) automatically controls the relative position between the drill tools <b>3</b>, the tool unit <b>4</b>, and the workpiece <b>8</b> on the basis of the arrangement position of the tool unit <b>4</b> and the arrangement position of the workpiece <b>8</b> defined by a coordinate value. However, the present invention is not limited to an NC machine tool <b>1</b>, and application can also be made to a manual machine tool in which control of the relative position between the drill tools <b>3</b>, the tool unit <b>4</b>, and the workpiece <b>8</b> is carried out manually. In the case that application is made to this type of manual machine tool, the time in which the work of machining the workpiece <b>8</b> is stopped can be reduced and the utilization ratio of the machine tool apparatus can be improved by performing the work of machining the workpiece <b>8</b> held on one of the work palettes <b>14</b> in the machining position at the same time that the work of mounting and dismounting an unprocessed workpiece <b>8</b> on another work palette <b>14</b> is carried out.</p>
