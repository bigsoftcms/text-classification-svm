<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an expanded metal machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Expanded metals are materials with orifices in the surface, which are produced by offset cuts without loss of material, while performing an expanding deformation at the same time, using flat materials, particularly metal sheets or metal strips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this process (with vertical orientation of the machine), the following steps are performed in consecutive cycles: the flat starting material is guided between blades, the starting material is cut by the moving blade while undergoing an expanding deformation, the blade is retracted vertically and then displaced laterally by half a mesh length, the blade is again displaced vertically for cutting into the starting material, thus creating the first meshes, and subsequently the blade is again vertically retracted and displaced laterally in the starting position, whereupon the starting material can again be fed. Thereafter, the expanded metal can be further processed, such as flat-rolled.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The expanded metals produced in this way are generally made of a high number of meshes in the longitudinal and transverse directions. During production, an even vertical cutting depth or immersion depth between the two blades is required since even minor deviations in the lateral direction, which is to say minor expansion differences of the meshes produced in one reciprocating movement, can form distortions in the finished mesh pattern, which are immediately apparent to the observer due to the regularity of the pattern, particularly in the case of larger widths and lengths. This may result in considerable visual impairment of the otherwise very aesthetic expanded metal. In the case of longer expanded metals, these distortions occurring in the longitudinal direction can add up and result in larger warping.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">So as to correct and/or adjust the height positions of blades received in blade holding fixtures, at times a rough setting is performed in that cigarette paper or the like is placed between the blade and blade holding fixture. Such settings, however, are imprecise and only allow rough adjustments within discrete values.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,597 describes an expanded metal machine having a fixed blade, a displaceable blade, and the displaceable blade being vertically and transversely displaceable with a reciprocating motion in a vertical and a transverse direction, respectively. In that invention, cutting projections are formed both on the upper blade and on the lower blade, the projections engaging each other such that the flat material is received between the cutting projections disposed offset from one another during the cutting movement. Both the upper and the lower blades are displaced periodically in the lateral direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE 197 28 913 C1 discloses an expanded metal machine, wherein for setting the cutting stroke and hence the mesh size of the expanded metal or mesh pattern to be produced a maximum cutting stroke can be reduced by means of adjusting wedges controlled by step motors. The maximum cutting stroke here is defined by eccentric disks provided on upper blade carriers or an upper blade holding fixture, the disks being driven by a shaft and pressing the upper blade carrier downward by means of the adjusting wedges.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore the object of the invention to create an expanded metal machine, which enables precise fine adjustment of the cutting depth.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This object is achieved with an expanded metal machine which includes a fixed blade, a displaceable blade, displaceable in a vertical and a transverse direction and which has a cutting edge with cutting projections interspaced in the transverse direction. A conveying device is provided for conveying a flat material in a direction of conveyance between the blades. There is a ram for effecting a periodic vertical movement of displaceable blade, and a transverse displacing device for effecting a transverse displacement of displaceable blade that is synchronized with reciprocating motion. To enable a precise fine adjustment of the cutting gap, fixed blade is held in a fixed one-piece or multiple piece blade holding fixture vertically adjustable by a depth of cut adjusting device for adjusting a vertical depth of cut between the blades. Depth of cut adjusting device has at least two oppositely tapering wedges, displaceable in a coupled manner and having parallel sloped surfaces held in blade holding fixture in a sliding manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This and other objects are achieved by the further preferred further embodiments as set forth below.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, thus a wedge adjusting device is provided for the smooth or fixed blade. Advantageously, a plurality of gap adjusting devices are provided next to one another in the lateral or transverse direction, thus allowing fine correction of the course of the gap in the transverse direction. As a result of the wedge adjusting devices, continuous and precise adjustment becomes possible, wherein the wedges are advantageously received without clearance and, depending on the displacement in opposite directions, also enable opposite adjustments of the cutting gap.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a preferred embodiment, the wedge adjusting device has two oppositely tapering wedges, which are coupled to each other and have parallel sloped or inclined surfaces. In this way, effective adjustment in the vertical direction up and down becomes possible without clearance. The two wedges in turn can be displaced by a further wedge adjusting device with two coupled wedges, thus enabling a very high reduction ratio. The two further wedges can be displaced particularly in the vertical direction by a vertical wedge holding fixture, which&#x2014;just like the fixed blade holding fixture&#x2014;is received in a housing holding fixture in a vertically displaceable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The displacement can be performed without interruption of the manufacturing process and can also be automated through NC drives.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">So as to produce an expanded metal <b>1</b>, a flat, metal starting material, such as a steel strip <b>2</b> from a coil, is processed by offset cuts without loss of material, while undergoing an expanding deformation at the same time. The metal strip <b>2</b> is guided between a lower blade <b>3</b> and an upper blade <b>4</b>. In the embodiment shown according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <i>f</i>, the upper blade <b>4</b> is displaced and the lower blade <b>3</b> is held rigidly. In principle, the reverse kinematic configuration is also possible advantageously according to the invention. The displaced blade <b>4</b> has a serrated cutting edge <b>6</b> with a plurality of cutting projections <b>8</b> in the transverse direction, the projections preferably being evenly spaced. The fixed lower blade <b>3</b> has an even configuration. So as to produce the expanded metal <b>1</b>, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>first the metal strip <b>2</b> is guided in the direction of conveyance T between the blades <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and thereafter the upper blade <b>4</b> is moved downward, so that according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>it cuts into the metal strip <b>2</b> with the cutting projections <b>8</b> and expands regions of the metal strip <b>2</b> that protrude downward beyond the lower blade <b>3</b> in the downward direction. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the upper blade <b>6</b> is then displaced upward and thereafter, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, laterally by half a mesh width. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>, the upper blade <b>4</b> is then guided downward and again cuts into the metal strip <b>2</b> in positions offset by half a mesh in relation to the first cuts, expanding the developing cross-members <b>10</b> of the expanded metal <b>1</b> in the downward direction, so that rhombic meshes <b>11</b> are formed with the orifices <b>12</b> surrounded by the cross-members <b>10</b>. Thereafter, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>e</i>, the upper blade <b>4</b> is displaced again upward and then, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>f</i>, in the lateral direction back into the starting position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the direction of conveyance T of the conveying device conveying a flat material is transverse relative to the vertical direction of the displaceable blade and is likewise transverse relative to the lateral direction of the displaceable blade.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, the vertical cutting depth <b>20</b> is adjusted on the fixed blade, which according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be the lower blade, according to the invention, however, advantageously can also be the upper blade. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front view of the fixed blade holding fixture <b>22</b>. In the lateral direction and next to one another, a plurality of individual blades or advantageously a continuous fixed blade (not shown here) are disposed on the fixed blade holding fixture <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The blade holding fixture <b>22</b> is displaced in the vertical direction to adjust the cutting depth <b>20</b> by means of a plurality of laterally adjacently disposed immersion or cutting depth adjusting devices <b>24</b>. The cutting depth adjusting device <b>24</b> has two oppositely tapering wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, which are slidably mounted in sliding elements <b>30</b> of the blade holding fixture <b>22</b>. The wedges <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> each have a horizontal surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>or <b>27</b><i>b </i>and a sloped surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>or <b>27</b><i>a</i>, wherein the sloped surfaces <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>a </i>extend parallel to one another and receive a center region <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the blade holding fixture between them, the region accordingly having upper and lower sloped surfaces with sliding elements <b>30</b>. The wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> here are received between the sliding elements <b>30</b> of the blade holding fixture <b>22</b> without clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the case of a coupled longitudinal adjustment of the wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to the right, the blade holding fixture <b>22</b> is adjusted vertically upward in accordance with a reduction ratio determined by the gradient of the surfaces <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>a</i>, such as 1:10. Accordingly, the blade holding fixture <b>22</b> is displaced downward with a longitudinal displacement of the wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> to the left at the same reduction ratio. The blade holding fixture <b>22</b> is slidably mounted in a housing holding fixture <b>34</b>, for example by means of vertical sliding elements <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The displacement of the wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> is advantageously likewise performed by wedges. For this purpose, two in the vertical direction oppositely tapering wedges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> are fastened to a vertical wedge holding fixture <b>40</b> by means of screws or bolts <b>38</b>, the wedge holding fixture being slidably received in the housing holding fixture <b>34</b>. The wedges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> with the sloped surfaces thereof rest against correspondingly sloped faces <b>26</b><i>c</i>, <b>26</b><i>d </i>of the wedge <b>26</b> and corresponding sloped faces <b>27</b><i>c</i>, <b>27</b><i>d </i>of the wedge <b>27</b>. During a vertical upward displacement of the vertical wedge holding fixture <b>40</b> by means of the wedges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> in the upward direction, thus the wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are displaced in the longitudinal direction according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to the right; depending on the gradient of the sloped faces <b>26</b><i>c, d </i>and <b>27</b><i>c, d </i>in turn a corresponding reduction ratio is obtained. In the illustrated embodiment, a displacement range of 30 mm of the wedge holding fixture <b>40</b> may result in a displacement range of 10 mm of the wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and accordingly a displacement range of 1 mm of the blade holding fixture <b>22</b>, which is to say an overall reduction ratio of 1:30. The wedge holding fixture <b>40</b> in turn can experience further reduction, for example by a threaded drive <b>41</b> and a worm drive <b>42</b>. The displacement can then be performed via a belt drive <b>43</b> and a hand wheel <b>44</b>, which can advantageously also be replaced with an NC drive. The displacement can be performed without interrupting the machine operation (expanded metal production). According to the&#x2014;partially cut&#x2014;front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, fine adjustment of the vertical cutting depth <b>20</b> in the lateral direction can be performed via a plurality of gap adjusting devices <b>24</b>, which each comprise a pair of horizontal wedges <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, a pair of vertical wedges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and threaded and worm drives <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> that displace these wedges, the drives being used for the fine adjustment via the hand wheel <b>44</b>.</p>
