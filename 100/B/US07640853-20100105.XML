<p id="p-0005" num="0011">Before filling the pressing chamber with matter such as the grape harvest, means of sucking the pressure agent out of the control chamber are actuated, so that a vacuum is produced therein and the membrane is against the second half of the lateral wall and the flanges of the cage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0012">To produce the pressing, once filling is complete, means of admitting a pressure agent into the control chamber are actuated, so that the matter that is present therein is applied against the drainage means and pressurized, with the result that the liquid part of this matter flows through the drainage means. In general, several phases of pressing the matter such as grape harvest are carried out, the pressing phases being separated by press-cake breaking-up phases in which the cage is rotated about its axis to dislodge the cake of matter that is formed under the effect of the pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0013">To empty the cage once the pressing is complete, the door is opened and the cage rotated so that the solid part remaining in the pressing chamber is gradually evacuated through the orifice revealed by the door.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">To avoid damaging the membrane, the vacuum is formed in the control chamber in the press-cake breaking-up phase and in the emptying phase.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">The invention aims to increase the possibilities of use of such a press.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">The press according to the invention is characterized in that the means of recovering the liquid part of the matter comprise:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0017">on the cage, at least one external racking device, and a connection unit through which opens out the outlet orifice of the racking device; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0018">on said chassis, a liquid taking device comprising a telescopic tubular unit having a retracted position in which said telescopic unit presents no obstacle to the rotation of the cage and an extended position in which said telescopic unit is adapted, when the cage is in a predetermined pressing angular position, to come against said connection unit in a seal-tight bearing manner about the outlet orifice of the racking device.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0019">Thus, in the extended position, the telescopic tubular unit is connected to the racking device and can guide the liquid flowing from the latter towards a tank for receiving the liquid part.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0020">The press according to the invention offers the advantage of making it possible, in a simple, convenient and cost-effective manner, to recover the liquid part leaving the press without this liquid part coming into contact with the air, which is particularly useful when this liquid part is sensitive to oxidation, for example when the matter is the grape harvest to be made into white wine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0021">If required, the press according to the invention can be used conventionally with a matter of which the liquid part can stand contact with the air, for example the grape harvest to be made into red wine, the liquid part then being conventionally recovered in a tank positioned on the ground which receives the liquid part falling by gravity from the outlet orifice of the racking device or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0022">It will be observed that, given in particular the absence of revolving gasket, it is relatively simple to convert an already existing conventional press into a press according to the invention, by adding a unit for connecting to the racking device and by adding the liquid taking device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0023">According to characteristics that are preferred for reasons of simplicity, convenience and cost-effectiveness, both in production and in use:

<p id="p-0024" num="0043">Inside the cage <b>2</b> there is a deformable flexible membrane <b>8</b> (not represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), fixed in a seal-tight manner, on the one hand, to the lateral wall <b>6</b> along two opposite longitudinal edges <b>9</b> and, on the other hand, to the flanges <b>7</b> along two respective transversal edges <b>10</b> each situated between an end of one edge <b>9</b> and an end of the other edge <b>9</b>, the membrane <b>8</b>, at rest (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), having somewhat the form of a half of the cage <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0044">The internal volume of the latter is subdivided by the membrane <b>8</b> into a pressing chamber <b>11</b> and a control chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0045">The pressing chamber <b>11</b> is delimited by the membrane <b>8</b>, by the half of the lateral wall <b>6</b>, situated between the longitudinal edges <b>9</b>, that can be seen at the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and by the half of each of the flanges <b>7</b> that can be seen above the transversal edges <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0046">As for the control chamber <b>12</b>, it is delimited by the membrane <b>8</b> and by the other half of the lateral wall <b>6</b> and of the flanges <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0047">To enable the cage <b>2</b> to be mounted to rotate on the posts <b>4</b>, the cage <b>2</b> comprises, at the center of each of the flanges <b>7</b>, respectively a journal <b>13</b> cooperating with a bearing <b>14</b> supported by the posts <b>4</b> that can be seen on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a journal <b>15</b> cooperating with a bearing <b>16</b> supported by the posts <b>4</b> that can be seen on the right.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0048">In the example illustrated, the journal <b>13</b> serves as a nozzle for the control chamber <b>12</b> with which it communicates.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0049">The nozzle <b>13</b> allows either the suction of the air that is contained in the chamber <b>12</b>, or the admission into this chamber of compressed air, the connection and the pipelines connected to the nozzle <b>13</b> and the compressor and the vacuum pump making it possible to admit and suck out compressed air being symbolized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the arrows <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0050">Just as the journal <b>13</b> serves as a nozzle for the control chamber <b>12</b>, the journal <b>15</b> serves as a nozzle for the pressing chamber <b>11</b>, with which it is in communication. Opposite from tank <b>2</b>, the nozzle <b>15</b> is extended by an assembly <b>30</b> comprising a pneumatic valve <b>31</b> and a coupling <b>32</b> for a link pipe to an inert gas source, the valve <b>30</b> being used to open or close the passage between the coupling <b>31</b> and the nozzle <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0051">To allow the introduction of the matter to be pressed into the chamber <b>11</b> and, after pressing, the evacuation of the solid part of this matter, the lateral wall <b>6</b> is provided with two openings, each of which can be blocked by a door <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0052">To allow for the separation between the solid and liquid parts of the matter introduced into the pressing chamber <b>11</b>, the lateral wall <b>6</b> is fitted with perforated gutters <b>20</b>, in this case seven of them, which make it possible to drain this matter as explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0053">Whereas each of the gutters <b>20</b> is perforated, each portion of the wall <b>6</b> situated in line with a gutter <b>20</b> is solid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">For each space delimited by the wall <b>6</b> and by a gutter <b>20</b>, the liquid is evacuated out of the cage <b>2</b> by a racking device <b>33</b> positioned outside the lateral wall <b>6</b> at the end of the cage <b>2</b> that can be seen on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. Each device <b>33</b> comprises a pipe <b>34</b> in communication with the space delimited by the wall <b>6</b> and a gutter <b>20</b>, the distal end of the pipe <b>34</b> forming a coupling <b>35</b> on which is mounted a pneumatic valve <b>36</b> of which the end opposite to the coupling <b>35</b> forms the outlet orifice <b>37</b> of the racking device <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">Between the different perforated gutters <b>20</b>, there are provided pipes <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which link them in pairs so that the liquid collected by one of the gutters <b>20</b> can join the other gutters <b>20</b> and be evacuated by any one of the racking devices <b>33</b>, in particular by that associated with the perforated gutter <b>20</b> which is central, that is, the gutter <b>20</b> on either side of which there are here three other gutters <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">The racking device <b>33</b> of the central gutter <b>20</b> is associated with a plate <b>39</b> projecting radially from the external side of the wall <b>6</b>, the outlet orifice <b>37</b> of the device <b>33</b> opening out through the plate <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">As explained later, the plate <b>39</b> serves as a unit for connecting to the liquid taking device <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">Each of the racking devices <b>33</b>, and more specifically the outlet orifice <b>37</b> of each device <b>33</b>, is vertically in line with the tank <b>5</b> so that the liquid flowing from the orifice <b>37</b> is collected in the tank <b>5</b>, which is fitted in the bottom part with a bung <b>41</b> to which is connected a pipe linking to a tank for receiving the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">To avoid splashes when the liquid is flowing, protection walls <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> supported by the chassis of which the posts <b>4</b> form a part are provided either side of the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0060">To drive the cage <b>2</b> rotation-wise, the press <b>1</b> comprises, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, an electric motor <b>21</b> supported by the posts <b>4</b> that can be seen on the left, the rotary shaft of the motor <b>21</b> being equipped with a gear <b>22</b> which engages with an intermediate gear <b>23</b>, which also engages with a toothed wheel <b>24</b> mounted on the flange <b>7</b> of the cage <b>2</b> that can be seen on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the wheel <b>24</b> being centered, like the cage <b>2</b>, on the axis <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0061">Before introducing matter such as the grape harvest into the chamber <b>11</b>, the cage <b>2</b> is placed in a position in which the doors <b>19</b> are at the top of the cage <b>2</b>, the doors <b>19</b> are opened and the suction means <b>18</b> are actuated in order to produce the vacuum in the control chamber <b>12</b>, the result of this being that the membrane <b>8</b> is against the lateral wall <b>6</b> and against the flanges <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0062">The matter such as the grape harvest is then introduced through the openings revealed by the doors <b>19</b>, this matter, given the positioning of the openings, being distributed by itself relatively evenly in the pressing chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0063">Once the filling is complete, the doors <b>19</b> are closed and the cage <b>2</b> is switched from the filling position in which the doors <b>19</b> are at the top of the cage <b>2</b> to the pressing position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, this angular displacement of the cage <b>2</b> being of the order of a quarter of a turn (90&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0064">In the pressing position, the gutter <b>20</b> that is central, that is, the gutter either side of which there are in this case three other gutters <b>20</b>, is in the bottommost position of the cage <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0065">When contact between the liquid part of the matter to be treated and the atmosphere presents no particular drawback, for example when it is a grape harvest that is to be made into red wine, the valve of each of the racking devices <b>33</b> is opened in the pressing position so that the liquid can flow from each of the orifices <b>37</b> and be collected in the tank <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0066">When, on the other hand, there is a desire to prevent the liquid coming into contact with the atmosphere, the racking devices <b>33</b> remain closed apart from the racking device associated with the gutter <b>20</b> which is in the bottommost position, in this case the central gutter. The presence of the pipes <b>38</b> linking the gutters <b>20</b> allows all the liquid to flow through this single racking device located at the lowest point of the cage <b>2</b>. The running liquid is not then collected in the tank <b>5</b> but with the device <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0067">To force the extraction of the liquid part (pressing), for example after having allowed the liquid to flow naturally (draining), the means <b>17</b> of allowing compressed air into the control chamber <b>12</b> are actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0068">The membrane <b>8</b> is then applied against the matter introduced into the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0069">Under the effect of this pressure and under the effect of gravity, the liquid part of the matter runs through the perforations of the gutters <b>20</b> and either into the recovery tank <b>5</b> through the various racking devices <b>33</b> when they are all open, or into the liquid sampling device <b>40</b> through just the device <b>33</b> situated in the lowest position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0070">Once the liquid stops flowing, the suction means <b>18</b> are actuated until the membrane <b>8</b> is once again against the lateral wall <b>6</b> and against the flanges <b>7</b>. Where appropriate, if the liquid taking device <b>40</b> is used, its tubular slide <b>46</b> is brought into the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0071">The cage <b>2</b> is then turned for a certain time in order to break up the press-cake, that is, dislodge the cake of matter that was formed under the effect of pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0072">A certain number of pressing and press-cake breaking-up phases are then performed, then, when it is assumed that all of the liquid part of the matter has been extracted, the doors <b>19</b> are opened and the cage <b>2</b> is turned, with, of course, the membrane <b>8</b> against the lateral wall <b>6</b> and the flanges <b>7</b>, so that the solid part of the matter remaining in the chamber <b>11</b> is gradually evacuated through the openings revealed by the doors <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">As can be seen more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the liquid taking device <b>40</b> comprises a guide bushing <b>45</b> oriented horizontally and fixed to the protection wall <b>42</b>, a tubular slide <b>46</b> engaged in the bushing <b>45</b>, a pneumatic jack <b>47</b>, the body <b>48</b> of which is fixed to the posts <b>4</b> that support the motor <b>21</b> and the stem <b>49</b> of which is fixed to the slide <b>46</b>, a rigid pipe <b>50</b> supported by the same posts <b>4</b>, of which one end, situated outside of cage <b>2</b>, is linked to the tubular slide <b>46</b> by a flexible pipe <b>51</b> while the other end of the rigid pipe <b>50</b>, situated on the side opposite to the cage <b>2</b>, presents a coupling <b>52</b> for a link pipe to a tank for receiving the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">The slide <b>46</b> comprises two straight tubular portions positioned transversally relative to each other, respectively a relatively long portion <b>53</b>, by which the slide is engaged in the bushing <b>45</b>, and a relatively short portion <b>54</b>, extending from the portion <b>53</b> to a coupling to which the flexible pipe <b>51</b> is fixed. The end of the portion <b>53</b> situated outside of cage <b>2</b> (end that can be seen on the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) is provided with a ring <b>55</b> supporting, on the side opposite to the portion <b>53</b>, an annular sealing gasket <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0075">A bellows <b>57</b> is positioned between the bushing <b>45</b> and the ring <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0076">The stem <b>49</b> of the jack <b>47</b> is linked to the slide <b>46</b> opposite the ring <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0077">The slide <b>46</b> moves between the retracted position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> and the extended position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the slide <b>46</b> being driven between these two positions by the jack <b>47</b>, the stem of which leaves the body <b>48</b> to move from the retracted position to the extended position, while the stem <b>49</b> returns into the body <b>48</b> to move from the extended position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0078">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, in the retracted position, the slide <b>46</b>, and more specifically the head formed by the ring <b>55</b> and the gasket <b>56</b>, is separate from the racking devices <b>33</b> so that the device <b>40</b> presents no obstacle to the rotation of the cage <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0079">The retracted position of the slide <b>46</b> is defined by the ring <b>55</b> coming into contact with the distal end of the bushing <b>45</b>, the ring <b>55</b> thus forming a stroke end stop.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0080">The slide <b>46</b> is designed to be placed in the extended position after the cage <b>2</b> has been placed in the angular pressing position, the plate <b>39</b> then being in the lowest position of the cage <b>2</b> and facing the slide <b>46</b>, and more specifically the head formed by the ring <b>55</b> and the gasket <b>56</b>, the orifice <b>37</b> being centered relative to this head and to the straight portion <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0081">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the extended position, the slide <b>46</b> comes into contact via the gasket <b>56</b> with the plate <b>39</b> around the outlet orifice <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0082">It is then possible to open the valve <b>36</b> of the racking device with which the plate <b>39</b> is associated, the device <b>40</b> then guiding the liquid flowing from the orifice <b>37</b> to the coupling <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0083">Once the liquid stops flowing, the valve of the racking device <b>33</b> associated with the plate <b>39</b> is closed, the jack <b>47</b> is actuated to move the device <b>40</b> into the retracted position, the suction means <b>18</b> are actuated until the membrane <b>8</b> is against the lateral wall <b>6</b> and against the flanges <b>7</b> and the cage <b>2</b> can then be turned in order to perform a breaking-up of the press-cake.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0084">When the liquid part of the matter to be treated is sensible to contact with the air, the assembly <b>30</b> makes it possible to inject an inert gas into the cage <b>2</b>, this gas penetrating through the coupling <b>32</b> and into the cage <b>2</b> through the opening of the valve <b>31</b>. Such an injection of gas can be performed before and/or after the filling of the cage <b>2</b> with the matter to be treated, even during the press-cake breaking-up phases.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0085">The various actuation units of the press <b>1</b>, in particular the motor <b>21</b>, the valve <b>31</b>, the valves <b>36</b> and the jack <b>47</b>, are linked to a programmable control unit which controls their operation according to predetermined sequences that facilitate the task of the user and enable the press <b>1</b> to operate in total safety. In particular, this control unit prohibits the actuation of the motor <b>21</b> when the juice sampling device <b>40</b> is in the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0086">It can be seen that the press <b>1</b> can equally be used with a matter of which the liquid part is sensible to contact with the air, which can provoke its oxidation, for example when the matter is the grape harvest to be made into white wine, and with a matter which can stand contact with the air, for example a grape harvest to be made into red wine.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0087">In the latter case, the liquid taking device <b>40</b> is not used (it remains in the retracted position) and, in the pressing phases, all the racking devices <b>33</b> are opened, the liquid being collected in the tank <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0088">In a variant that is not represented, in order to speed up the flow of the liquid part when the latter must be protected from the ambient air, there are provided several juice taking devices <b>40</b>, for example three of them.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0089">In another variant that is not illustrated, advantageous in the case where the speed of flow of the liquid part is of no particular importance, certain racking devices <b>33</b> are eliminated, even all of them except, of course, for the one associated with the plate <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0090">In other variants that are not illustrated, the plate <b>39</b> is replaced by a connection unit that is arranged differently, for example with a bayonet coupling rather than a simple bearing force; and/or the telescopic tubular unit is different from the slide <b>46</b>, with, for example, a T-shape rather than an L-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0091">In other variants that are not illustrated, the valves <b>31</b> and <b>36</b> and the jack <b>47</b> are of different type, for example electric instead of pneumatic; the number of perforated gutters <b>20</b> is different from seven, for example five; the link pipes between the gutters such as <b>38</b> are external to the cage rather than internal to the latter; and/or the pressure agent used is different from compressed air, for example water.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0092">Numerous other variants are possible according to circumstances, and it will be recalled in this respect that the invention is not limited to the examples described and represented.</p>
