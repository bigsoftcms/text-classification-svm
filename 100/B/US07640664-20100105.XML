<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Oriented Strand Board (OSB) is an engineered structural-use panel typically manufactured from thin wood strands bonded together with resin under heat and pressure, and it is used extensively for roof, wall, and floor sheathing in residential and commercial construction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One drawback associated with known oriented strand boards (OSB) is that they are susceptible to edge swell or flare due to moisture absorption. In fact, the largest detractor to OSB flooring is the need to sand tongue and groove joints due to flare (swell) due to moisture during construction. Upon swelling, the top surface of the OSB panel will necessitate sanding, especially when used in flooring applications. This is not only time-consuming, but is also an added expense. Currently, edge swell or flare due to moisture absorption is addressed with increased amounts of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin, isocyanate resin and/or increased density (i.e., additional wood). These are all added expenses that must be born by the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for a wood-based composite panel (e.g., OSB) that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell or flare due to moisture absorption above the plane of the top surface of the panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a wood-based composite panel that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell or flare due to moisture absorption above the plane of the top surface of the panel. Upon swelling, the top surface of the panel of the present invention will not require sanding, even when used in flooring applications. The use of such panel will save time and money during construction. The manufacturing of such panel will obviate the need for increased amounts of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin, isocyanate resin and/or increased density (i.e., additional wood), which typically add to the overall expense of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a wood-based composite panel that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell. The panel includes: a top surface having four opposing sides that define a perimeter; and a bottom surface opposite the top surface having four opposing sides that define a perimeter; the top and bottom surfaces forming a non-uniform width, such that the width along at least one of the four opposing sides of the oppositely facing top and bottom surfaces is less than the thickness of the remaining portions of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention also provides a wood-based composite panel that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell, the panel prepared by the process that includes: (i) contacting flakes of wood with a first resin, such that the first resin is located on at least a portion of the surface of the flakes of wood; (ii) forming a blanket of substantially oriented flakes; (iii) curing the first resin by exposing the first resin to at least one of an elevated temperature, an elevated pressure, and radiant energy; for a sufficient period of time; to effectively cure the first resin; thereby effectively providing a wood-based composite panel; and (iv) removing a portion of the panel, thereby providing a panel having a non-uniform width such that the width along at least one of the outer sides of the oppositely facing top and bottom surfaces is less than the width of the remaining portions of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention also provides a wood-based composite panel that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell. The panel is prepared by the process that includes: (i) contacting veneers of wood with a first resin, such that the first resin is located on at least a portion of the surface of the veneers of wood; (ii) forming a stack of alternating oriented veneers; (iii) curing the first resin by exposing the first resin to at least one of an elevated temperature, an elevated pressure, and radiant energy; for a sufficient period of time; to effectively cure the first resin; thereby effectively providing a wood-based composite panel; and (iv) removing a portion of the panel, thereby providing a panel having a non-uniform width such that the width along at least one of the outer sides of the oppositely facing top and bottom surfaces is less than the width of the remaining portions of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also provides a process for manufacturing a wood-based composite panel that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell, the process includes: (i) contacting flakes of wood with a first resin; (ii) orienting, in substantially alternate lengthwise and crosswise layers, the flakes of wood to provide a blanket of substantially oriented flakes; (iii) curing the first resin by exposing the first resin to at least one of an elevated temperature, an elevated pressure, and radiant energy; for a sufficient period of time; to effectively cure the first resin; thereby effectively providing a wood-based composite panel; and (iv) removing a portion of the panel, thereby providing a panel having a non-uniform width such that the width along at least one of the outer sides of the oppositely facing top and bottom surfaces is less than the width of the remaining portions of the panel.</p>

These materials are optionally formed from moisture-containing substrates, permeable substrates, and substrates which are both moisture-containing and permeable. Suitable wood-based composite panels include, e.g., particle board, oriented strand board (OSB), laminate veneer lumber (LVL), and plywood. The lifespan of the wood-based composite panel can be, e.g., up to about 25 years, up to about 50 years, or up to about 100 years. The panel can be configured, e.g., for tongue and groove fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The wood-based composite panel will include a top surface and an oppositely facing bottom surface, as well as two pairs of opposing side surfaces. As with any rectangular prism, the wood-based composite panel more precisely and accurately includes six outer surfaces (i.e., three pairs of oppositely facing surfaces). As such, as used herein a &#x201c;top surface&#x201d; and an oppositely facing &#x201c;bottom surface&#x201d; refers to the two surfaces of the wood-based composite panel with the two largest surface areas. Additionally, as used herein, a &#x201c;side surface&#x201d; refers to a surface of the wood-based composite panel having a surface area less than the surface area of the top surface or the bottom surface. It is appreciated that those of skill in the art understand that the wood-based composite panel includes six outer surfaces (i.e., three pairs of oppositely facing surfaces), but reference to the wood-based composite panel as including a top surface, a bottom surface and two pairs of oppositely facing side surfaces is acceptable and appropriate to those of skill in the art.</p>

The strands in the core layers are usually aligned substantially perpendicular to the strand alignment of the face layers, like the cross-laminated veneers of plywood.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is appreciated that those of skill in the art understand that OSB is typically characterized by those starting materials or intermediate components (e.g., resin and flakes of wood) that are useful in making the OSB. While these materials may undergo a substantial conversion during the manufacturing of the OSB, reference to OSB as including these materials or components is acceptable and appropriate to those of skill in the art. For example, the flakes of wood and the resin, during the pressing step (e.g., curing), can undergo a chemical and/or physical conversion, such that they may no longer expressly and literally meet the criteria to be classified as flakes of wood and resin, respectively. Reference to the OSB as including a resin and flakes of wood is, however, acceptable and appropriate to those of skill in the art. As such, as used herein, &#x201c;oriented strand board&#x201d; includes resin(s) and flakes of wood.</p>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the plywood is manufactured from veneers of wood, wherein each veneer is perpendicular to the veneer directly above (if present) and directly below (if present) that veneer. In another embodiment of the present invention, each of the veneers face the same direction (e.g., in the lengthwise direction) to form what is referred to as laminate veneer lumber (LVL). In another embodiment, the veneers can be randomly oriented.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is appreciated that those of skill in the art understand that plywood is typically characterized by those starting materials or intermediate components (e.g., resin and veneers of wood) useful in making the plywood. While these materials may undergo a substantial conversion during the manufacturing of the plywood, reference to the plywood as including these materials or components is acceptable and appropriate to those of skill in the art. For example, the veneers of wood and the resin, during the pressing step (e.g., curing), can undergo a chemical and/or physical conversion, such that they will no longer expressly meet the criteria to be classified as a veneer of wood and resin, respectively. Reference to the plywood as including a resin and veneers of wood, however, is acceptable and appropriate to those of skill in the art.

Exemplary fungi include Ascomycetes (e.g., Neurospora, Saccharomyces, Morchella), Basidiomycetes (e.g., Amanita, Agaricus), Zygomycetes (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus), Oomycetes (e.g., Allomyces), and Deuteromycetes (e.g., Penicillium, Aspergillus).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, &#x201c;algae&#x201d; refers to a large and diverse assemblage of eucaryotic organisms that contain chlorophyll and carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. See, Biology of Microorganisms, T. Brock and M. Madigan, 6th Ed., 1991, Prentice Hill (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.). Exemplary algae include Green Algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas), Euglenids (e.g., Euglena), Golden Brown Algae (e.g., Navicula), Brown Algae (e.g., Laminaria), Dinoflagellates (e.g., Gonyaulax), and Red Algae (e.g., polisiphonia).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, &#x201c;mold&#x201d; refers to a filamentous fungus, generally a circular colony that may be cottony, wooly, etc. or glabrous, but with filaments not organized into large fruiting bodies, such as mushrooms. See, e.g., Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 25th Ed., Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 1990 (Baltimore, Md.). One exemplary mold is the Basidiomycetes called wood-rotting fungi. Two types of wood-rotting fungi are the white rot and the brown rot. An ecological activity of many fungi, especially members of the Basidiomycetes is the decomposition of wood, paper, cloth, and other products derived from natural sources. Basidiomycetes that attack these products are able to utilize cellulose or lignin as carbon and energy sources. Lignin is a complex polymer in which the building blocks are phenolic compounds. It is an important constituent of woody plants. The decomposition of lignin in nature occurs almost exclusively through the agency of these wood-rotting fungi. Brown rot attacks and decomposes the cellulose and the lignin is left unchanged. White rot attacks and decomposes both cellulose and lignin. See, Biology of Microorganisms, T. Brock and M. Madigan, 6th Ed., 1991, Prentice Hill (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As used herein, &#x201c;yeast&#x201d; refers to unicellular fungi, most of which are classified with the Ascomytes. See, Biology of Microorganisms, T. Brock and M. Madigan, 6th Ed., 1991, Prentice Hill (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, &#x201c;mushrooms&#x201d; refer to filamentous fungi that are typically from large structures called fruiting bodies, the edible part of the mushroom.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As used herein, &#x201c;slime molds&#x201d; refers to nonphototrophic eucaryotic microorganisms that have some similarity to both fungi and protozoa. The slime molds can be divided into two groups, the cellular slime molds, whose vegetative forms are composed of single amoebalike cells, and the acellular slime molds, whose vegetive forms are naked masses of protoplasms of indefinite size and shape called plasmodia. Slime molds live primarily on decaying plant matter, such as wood, paper, and cloth. See, Biology of Microorganisms, T. Brock and M. Madigan, 6th Ed., 1991, Prentice Hill (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As used herein, &#x201c;fungal resistant&#x201d; refers to a substrate (e.g., wood-based composite panel) that has no appreciable amount of fungus present or growing on the surface therein. The amount, if any, fungus present or growing on the surface will typically be less than about 25%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less than about 1% of the fungus present or growing on the surface of an equivalent substrate that is non-fungal resistant. The fungal resistant substrate will typically include a chemical that will kill, destroy, inhibit, or inactivate a eucaryotic microorganism to prevent growth. Exemplary eucaryotic microorganisms include algae, fungi, slime mold, protozoa, and eucaryotes in the microbial world. The substrate (e.g., wood-based composite panel) can be fungal resistant due to the presence of one or more fungicides present on and/or in the substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Initially, logs pass through a flaker, where they are cut into thin strands (i.e., flakes (<b>12</b>)) of wood. Before the logs pass through a flaker, the logs can optionally be heated, especially if the logs are below about 10&#xb0; C. (50&#xb0; F.). The logs can be heated in any suitable manner, provided the physical and chemical integrity of the wood is not compromised. For example, the logs can be heated in a pond of water having a temperature of up to about 80&#xb0; C. (176&#xb0; F.), up to about 60&#xb0; C. (140&#xb0; F.), or up to about 40&#xb0; C. (104&#xb0; F.). Specifically, the logs can be heated in a pond of water having a temperature of about 100&#xb0; F. (38&#xb0; C.) to about 110&#xb0; F. (43&#xb0; C.). In addition, the logs can be heated for more than about 1 hour. Specifically, the logs can be heated for about 1 hour to about 48 hours. Alternatively, the logs can be heated via microwave for a suitable period of time, effective to dry the logs.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">After the logs are cut into thin strands (i.e., flakes) of wood, the flakes (<b>12</b>) can optionally be dried to remove at least some of the water present therein. The flakes (<b>12</b>) can be dried in any suitable manner, provided at least some of the water present therein is removed. For example, the flakes (<b>12</b>) can be dried using a tumble dryer. The flakes (<b>12</b>) can be dried under any suitable conditions (e.g., at a temperature of above about 40&#xb0; C. (104&#xb0; F.) for about 10 seconds or more), provided at least some of the water present therein is removed. Specifically, the flakes (<b>12</b>) can be dried at about 180&#xb0; F. to about 300&#xb0; F. for about 8 minutes to about 10 minutes.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A plywood that is not susceptible to top surface edge swell can be manufactured according to the present invention.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Initially, the logs are debarked and then placed in a hot water vault for about 8 to about 24 hours. The logs are then placed in a lathe, where a spindle knife cuts the logs into veneers (<b>13</b>) of wood. The veneers (<b>13</b>) are clipped in pieces about 8 feet or less in width. The clipped pieces are manually sorted into face sheets, filler sheets, and core sheets. These green veneers (<b>13</b>) are optionally stored or directly placed into a dryer for a suitable period of time to remove at least some of the water present therein. The dried veneers (<b>13</b>) are either stored or used directly in the mill. The dried veneers (<b>13</b>) are contacted with a first resin (<b>5</b>) and then oriented in alternate lengthwise and crosswise layers on a sheet or screen to form a stack of oriented veneers (<b>13</b>) of wood. The stack of oriented veneers (<b>13</b>) can be pressed (e.g., heated under pressure to compress the stack to a suitable width) and a portion of the panel (<b>2</b>) can be removed, thereby providing a panel (<b>1</b>) having a non-uniform width such that the width along at least one of the outer sides (<b>20</b>) of the oppositely facing top (<b>8</b>) and bottom surfaces (<b>9</b>) is less than the width of the remaining portions of the panel (<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Species of Timber</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Any suitable species of timber (i.e., wood) can be employed to make the wood-based composite panel. In addition, the wood-based composite panel can be manufactured from one or more suitable species of timber. Suitable types of timber include, e.g., Western, Northern (and Appalachian), and Southern timber.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Suitable Western timbers include, e.g., Incense-Cedar, Port-Orford-Cedar, Douglas Fir, White Fir, Western Hemlock, Western Larch, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Sugar Pine, Western White Pine, Western Redcedar, Redwood, Engelmann Spruce, Sitka Spruce, Yellow-Cedar, Red Alder, Oregon Ash, Aspen, Black Cottonwood, California Black Oak, Oregon White Oak, Big Leaf Maple, Paper Birch, and Tanoak.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Suitable Northern (and Appalachian) timbers include, e.g., Northern White Cedar, Balsam Fir, Eastern Hemlock, Fraser Fir, Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine, Eastern Red Cedar, Eastern Spruce, Tamarack, Ash, Aspen, Basswood, Buckeye, Butternut, American Beech, Birch, Black Cherry, American Chestnut, Cottonwood, Elm, Hack Berry, True Hickory, Honey Locust, Black Locust, Hard maple, Soft Maple, Red Oak, White Oak, American Sycamore, Black Walnut, and Yellow-Poplar.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Suitable Southern timbers include, e.g., Atlantic White Cedar, Bald Cypress, Fraser Fir, Southern Pine, Eastern Red Cedar, Ash, Basswood, Arnecan, Beech, Butternut, Cottonwood, Elm, Hackberry, Pecan Hickory, True Hickory, Honey Locust, Black Locust, Magnolia, Soft Maple, Red Oaks, Sassafras, Sweetgum, American Sycamore, Tupelo, Black Walnut, Black Willow, and Yellow Poplar.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">First Resins</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As described herein, the flakes (<b>12</b>) or veneers (<b>13</b>) are contacted with a first resin (<b>5</b>). The flakes (<b>12</b>) or veneer are subsequently cured to mechanically and chemically bind the first resin (<b>5</b>) to the flakes (<b>12</b>) or veneers (<b>13</b>). Such curing can typically be accomplished by exposing the first resin (<b>5</b>) and flakes (<b>12</b>) or the first resin (<b>5</b>) and veneers (<b>13</b>) to elevated temperatures, elevated pressures, and/or radiant energy (e.g., UV, electron beam, microwave, beta radiation, gamma radiation, neutron beam, proton beam, infra red, etc.) for a sufficient period of time to effectively cure the first resin (<b>5</b>). The first resin (<b>5</b>) can optionally include a catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Upon curing, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can impregnate the flakes (<b>12</b>) or the veneers (<b>13</b>), or the first resin (<b>5</b>) can remain on the outer surface of the flakes (<b>12</b>) or the veneers (<b>13</b>). The curing provides an OSB or plywood wherein the first resin (<b>5</b>) is mechanically and chemically bound to the flakes (<b>12</b>) or the veneers (<b>13</b>). The chemical bonding results in the formation of chemical linkages between the first resin (<b>5</b>) and the cellulose and hemicellulose in the flakes (<b>12</b>) or the veneers (<b>13</b>). Such curing of the first resin (<b>5</b>), therefore, effectively provides for the underlying wood-based substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The first resin (<b>5</b>) (i.e., adhesive polymer) can either be a thermoplastic polymer or a thermosetting polymer. Thermoplastic polymers are long-chain polymers that soften and flow on heating, then harden again by cooling. They generally have less resistance to heat, moisture, and long-term static loading than do thermosetting polymers. Common wood adhesives that are based on thermoplastic polymers include, e.g., polyvinyl acetate emulsions, elastomerics, contacts, and hot-melts. Alternatively, thermosetting polymers undergo irreversible chemical change, and on reheating, they do not soften and flow again. They form cross-linked polymers that have strength, have resistance to moisture and other chemicals, and are rigid enough to support high, long-term static loads without deforming. Suitable first resins (<b>5</b>) that are based on thermosetting polymers include, e.g., phenolic, resorcinolic, melamine, isocyanate, urea, an epoxy resin, a phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin, a melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin, a phenol-melamine-formaldehyde (PMF) resin, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The suitable first resin (<b>5</b>) can be of natural origin, can be of synthetic origin, or can include first resins (<b>5</b>) of a combination thereof. Suitable resins of natural origin include, e.g., animal protein, blood protein, casein protein, soybean protein, lignocellulostic residue and extracts, bark-based resins, and combinations thereof. Suitable resins of synthetic origin include, e.g., cross-linkable polyvinyl acetate emulsion, elastomeric contact, elastomeric mastic, emulsion polymer/isocyanate, epoxy, hot melt, isocyanate, formaldehyde, melamine and melamine urea, phenolic, polyvinyl acetate emulsion, polyurethane, resorcinol and phenol resorcinol, urea, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment of the present invention, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can be a foaming adhesive, such as dry cow blood.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Specifically, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can include an isocyanate resin, a melamine resin, a phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin, a melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin, a phenol-melamine-formaldehyde (PMF) resin, a melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resin, a phenol-melamine-urea-formaldehyde (PMUF) resin, or a combination thereof. More specifically, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can be a melamine resin, e.g., phenol-melamine-formaldehyde (PMF) resin which is commercially available from ARC Resins Corporation (Longueuil, Quebec, Canada), Borden Chemical Inc. (Columbus, Ohio), GP Resin (Atlanta, Ga.) or Dynea (Austria). PMF Resin is a phenol-melamine-formaldehyde copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Any suitable isocyanate can be employed as the first resin (<b>5</b>). Suitable isocyanates include, e.g., PMDI (polymethylenedipenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diisocyanate); MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate), or a combination thereof. Additional suitable isocayantes are disclosed, e.g., in Aldrich Catalogue (Milwaukee, Wis.).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The phenol can optionally be substituted. Suitable substituted phenols include, e.g., alkyl substituted phenols, aryl substituted phenols, cycloalkyl substituted phenols, alkenyl substituted phenols, alkoxy substituted phenols, aryloxy substituted phenols, and halogen substituted phenols, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,587. Additional suitable substituted phenols are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,549.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The formaldehyde can optionally be replaced with another suitable aldehyde. Suitable aldehydes include, e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, furfuraldehyde and benzaldehyde. In general, the aldehyde employed can have the formula R&#x2032;CHO wherein R&#x2032; is a hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to about 12 carbon atoms. Specifically, the aldehyde can be formaldehyde. Suitable additional aldehydes are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,587 and Aldrich Catalogue (Milwaukee, Wis.).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The first resin (<b>5</b>) can be a solid (e.g., powder) or a liquid. When the first resin (<b>5</b>) is a liquid, the liquid resin can be relatively viscous or relatively non-viscous. When the first resin (<b>5</b>) is a liquid and is relatively viscous, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can optionally be diluted with one or more carriers to render the first resin (<b>5</b>) relatively non-viscous. Suitable carriers include, e.g., water, organic hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additional suitable first resins (<b>5</b>) can be found, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,136,408; 6,132,549; 4,758,478; 5,700,587; 5,635,118; 5,714,099; 4,364,984; 4,407,999; 4,514,532; 5,425,908; 5,552,095; 5,554,429; 5,861,119; 5,951,795; 5,974,760; 6,028,133; 6,132,885; and references cite therein.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can include a polyolefin (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, or a combination thereof), alone or in combination with poly vinylacetate (PVA).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Some suitable first resins (<b>5</b>) are commercially available from, e.g., Borden Chemical Inc. (Columbus, Ohio) and ARC Resins Corporation (Longueuil, Canada).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The first resin (<b>5</b>) can be cured, e.g., under a suitable pressure and temperature for a sufficient period of time effective to cure the first resin (<b>5</b>). The length of time will typically depend upon the desired width of the OSB or the plywood. The length of time can be up to about 1 minute, up to about 2 minutes, up to about 3 minutes, up to about 4 minutes, up to about 5 minutes, or up to about 10 minutes. Typically, the length of time can be about 3.5 minutes to about 7.5 minutes. For example, for &#x215c; inch (9.52 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 230 seconds to about 240 seconds, for 7/16 inch (11.11 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 230 seconds to about 240 seconds, for 15/32 inch (11.9 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 260 seconds to about 270 seconds, for &#xbd; inch (12.7 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 280 seconds to about 290 seconds, for &#x215d; inch (15.88 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 360 seconds to about 370 seconds, and for &#xbe; inch (19 mm) OSB, the length of time can be about 420 seconds to about 440 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The first resin (<b>5</b>), upon curing, will preferably impart water-resistance and weather resistance upon the OSB or the plywood. The first resin (<b>5</b>) typically employed, prior to curing, will typically not undergo chemical or physical decomposition, to any appreciable degree, such that the first resin (<b>5</b>) will not cure. Additionally, the first resin (<b>5</b>) typically employed, after curing, will remain stable throughout the subsequent OSB or plywood process step(s).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The first resin (<b>5</b>) may require the presence of a catalyst and/or accelerator to cure the first resin (<b>5</b>). Any suitable catalyst and/or accelerator can be employed, provided the first resin (<b>5</b>) effectively cures in a suitable period of time and the first resin (<b>5</b>), upon curing, remains chemically and physically stable. Suitable catalysts include acid catalysts (e.g., formic acid), base catalysts (e.g., sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or soda ash), salt catalysts, peroxide catalysts, and sulfur compounds. Additionally, the first resin (<b>5</b>) can optionally include hardeners (e.g., amine hardeners added to epoxy and formaldehyde hardener added to resorcinol) to produce cross-linking reactions to solidify the first resin (<b>5</b>); antioxidants; acid scavengers; preservatives; wetting agents; defoamers; plasticizers; thickeners; and/or colorants. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,132,549; 5,498,647; 5,700,587; 4,514,532; and 4,758,478.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The first resin (<b>5</b>), prior to or upon curing, can impregnate the flake or the veneer. Specifically, the first resin (<b>5</b>), prior to or upon curing, can completely impregnate the flake or the veneer (i.e., the resin is completely embedded in the flake or the veneer). Alternatively, the first resin (<b>5</b>), prior to or upon curing, can partially impregnate the flake or the veneer. Specifically, the first resin (<b>5</b>), prior to or upon curing, can impregnate up to about 1/100 of the flake, up to about 1/50 of the flake, up to about 1/10 of the flake or the veneer, up to about &#xbc; of the flake or the veneer, up to about &#xbd; of the flake or the veneer, up to about &#xbe; of the flake or the veneer, or up to about 99/100 of the flake or the veneer. More specifically, the first resin (<b>5</b>), prior to or upon curing, can impregnate about 1/20 to about &#xbd; of the flake or the veneer.</p>
