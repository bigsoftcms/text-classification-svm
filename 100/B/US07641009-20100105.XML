<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power output apparatus, a vehicle equipped with the power output apparatus, and a control method of the power output apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One proposed structure of a power output apparatus has an oxygen sensor provided in an exhaust pipe of an engine mounted on a vehicle (see, for example, Patent Document 1). The power output apparatus of this proposed structure uses the oxygen sensor to measure the concentration of oxygen included in an exhaust gas of the engine and performs feedback control based on the measured concentration of oxygen to regulate the amount of fuel injected into the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-63822</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The oxygen sensor is essential for the operation control of the engine. There is accordingly a requirement of abnormality detection to ensure non-occurrence of any abnormality in the oxygen sensor for the adequate operation control of the engine. The oxygen sensor detects the atmosphere introduced into the exhaust pipe in response to a cutoff of fuel supply to the engine in a rotating state of an output shaft of the engine. The result of such detection determines normality or abnormality of the oxygen sensor. In vehicles configured to allow an engine to stop its operation during a drive of the vehicle and to be driven with only the output power of a motor, however, there is a little opportunity of cutting off the fuel supply to the engine in the rotating state of the output shaft of the engine. In these vehicles, the abnormality detection of the oxygen sensor may not be performed at an appropriate frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the power output apparatus, the vehicle equipped with the power output apparatus, and the control method of the power output apparatus, there would thus be a demand for increasing the opportunity of abnormality detection and enabling adequate detection of any abnormality occurring in an oxygen sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention accomplishes at least part of the demands mentioned above and the other relevant demands by the following configurations applied to the power output apparatus, the vehicle equipped with the power output apparatus, and the control method of the power output apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect, the invention pertains to a power output apparatus constructed to output power to a driveshaft. The power output apparatus includes:

The power output apparatus has: an internal combustion engine; an electric power-mechanical power input output assembly connected with a driveshaft and with an output shaft of the internal combustion engine in a rotatable manner independently of the driveshaft and configured to output a torque to the driveshaft and to the output shaft through input and output of electric power and mechanical power; a motor designed to input and output power from and to the driveshaft; an accumulator arranged to transmit electric power to and from the electric power-mechanical power input output assembly and the motor; and an oxygen content detector located in an exhaust system of the internal combustion engine and designed to measure a concentration of oxygen included in an exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine. The control method computes a charge level of the accumulator; and sets a driving force demand required for the driveshaft. In response to an abnormality detection request for executing abnormality detection to identify abnormality or normality of the oxygen content detector during operation of the internal combustion engine, when the computed charge level of the accumulator is lower than a preset reference charge level, the control method determines non-execution of the abnormality detection of the oxygen content detector regardless of the abnormality detection request, while controlling the internal combustion engine, the electric power-mechanical power input output assembly, and the motor to ensure output of a driving force corresponding to the set driving force demand to the driveshaft. When the computed charge level of the accumulator is not lower than the preset reference charge level, the control method cuts off a fuel supply to the internal combustion engine and executes the abnormality detection to identify abnormality or normality of the oxygen content detector based on an output of the oxygen content detector, while controlling the internal combustion engine, the electric power-mechanical power input output assembly, and the motor to ensure output of a driving force corresponding to the set driving force demand to the driveshaft.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates the configuration of a hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> equipped with a power output apparatus in one embodiment according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the schematic structure of an engine <b>22</b> mounted on the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b>. As illustrated, the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment includes the engine <b>22</b>, a three shaft-type power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> connected via a damper <b>28</b> to a crankshaft <b>26</b> or an output shaft of the engine <b>22</b>, a motor MG<b>1</b> connected to the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> and designed to have power generation capability, a reduction gear <b>35</b> attached to a ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>or a driveshaft linked with the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b>, a motor MG<b>2</b> connected to the reduction gear <b>35</b>, and a hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> configured to control the operations of the whole hybrid vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0052">The engine <b>22</b> is an internal combustion engine that consumes a hydrocarbon fuel, such as gasoline or light oil, to output power. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the air cleaned by an air cleaner <b>122</b> and taken into an air intake conduit via a throttle valve <b>124</b> is mixed with the atomized fuel injected from a fuel injection valve <b>126</b> to the air-fuel mixture. The air-fuel mixture is introduced into a combustion chamber <b>166</b> by means of an intake valve <b>128</b>. The introduced air-fuel mixture is ignited with spark made by a spark plug <b>130</b> to be explosively combusted. The reciprocating motions of a piston <b>132</b> pressed down by the combustion energy are converted into rotational motions of the crankshaft <b>26</b>. The exhaust from the engine <b>22</b> goes through a catalytic converter (three-way catalyst) <b>134</b> to convert toxic components included in the exhaust, that is, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), into harmless components, and is discharged to the outside air.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0053">The engine <b>22</b> is under control of an engine electronic control unit (hereafter referred to as engine ECU) <b>24</b>. The engine ECU <b>24</b> is constructed as a microprocessor including a CPU <b>24</b><i>a, </i>a ROM <b>24</b><i>b </i>configured to store processing programs, a RAM <b>24</b><i>c </i>configured to temporarily store data, input and output ports (not shown), and a communication port (not shown). The engine ECU <b>24</b> receives, via its input port, signals from various sensors designed to measure and detect the operating conditions of the engine <b>22</b>. The signals input into the engine ECU <b>24</b> include a crank position from a crank position sensor <b>140</b> detected as the rotational position of the crankshaft <b>26</b>, a cooling water temperature from a water temperature sensor <b>142</b> measured as the temperature of cooling water in the engine <b>22</b>, an in-cylinder pressure Pin from a pressure sensor <b>143</b> located inside the combustion chamber, cam positions from a cam position sensor <b>144</b> detected as the rotational positions of camshafts driven to open and close the intake valve <b>128</b> and an exhaust valve for gas intake and exhaust into and from the combustion chamber, a throttle position from a throttle valve position sensor <b>146</b> detected as the position of the throttle valve <b>124</b>, an air flow meter signal from an air flow meter <b>148</b> located in an air intake conduit, an intake air temperature from a temperature sensor <b>149</b> located in the air intake conduit, an air fuel ratio AF from an air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a </i>located in an exhaust pipe in the upstream of a catalytic converter <b>134</b>, and an oxygen signal from an oxygen sensor <b>135</b><i>b </i>located in the exhaust pipe in the downstream of the catalytic converter <b>134</b>. The air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a </i>is constructed as a known limiting current sensor of measuring the electric current to determine the air-fuel ratio AF, although its structure is not specifically illustrated. In the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a, </i>two electrodes are located on respective faces of a solid electrolyte such that one electrode is exposed to the exhaust gas and the other electrode is exposed to the atmosphere. A constant voltage is applied to the two electrodes. The quantity of oxygen ions moved through the solid electrolyte in response to application of the constant voltage corresponds to the amount of oxygen reaching the electrode exposed to the exhaust gas and is measured as electric current. The air-fuel ratio AF is computed from the measured electric current representing the quantity of the traveling oxygen ions. The engine ECU <b>24</b> outputs, via its output port, diverse control signals and driving signals to drive and control the engine <b>22</b>. The signals output from the engine ECU <b>24</b> include driving signals to the fuel injection valve <b>126</b>, driving signals to a throttle valve motor <b>136</b> driven to regulate the position of the throttle valve <b>124</b>, control signals to an ignition coil <b>138</b> integrated with an igniter, and control signals to a variable valve timing mechanism <b>150</b> to vary the open and close timings of the intake valve <b>128</b>. The engine ECU <b>24</b> establishes communication with the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> to drive and control the engine <b>22</b> in response to control signals received from the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> and to output data regarding the operating conditions of the engine <b>22</b> to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> according to the requirements. The engine ECU <b>24</b> also performs an arithmetic operation to compute a rotation speed of the crankshaft <b>26</b> or a rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b> from the crank position input from the crank position sensor <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">The power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> includes a sun gear <b>31</b> as an external gear, a ring gear <b>32</b> as an internal gear arranged concentrically with the sun gear <b>31</b>, multiple pinion gears <b>33</b> arranged to engage with the sun gear <b>31</b> and with the ring gear <b>32</b>, and a carrier <b>34</b> arranged to hold the multiple pinion gears <b>33</b> such as to allow both their revolutions and their rotations on their axes. The power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> is thus constructed as a planetary gear mechanism including the sun gear <b>31</b>, the ring gear <b>32</b>, and the carrier <b>34</b> as rotational elements of differential motions. The carrier <b>34</b>, the sun gear <b>31</b>, and the ring gear <b>32</b> of the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> are respectively linked to the crankshaft <b>26</b> of the engine <b>22</b>, to the motor MG<b>1</b>, and to the reduction gear <b>35</b> via the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i>When the motor MG<b>1</b> functions as a generator, the power of the engine <b>22</b> input via the carrier <b>34</b> is distributed to the sun gear <b>31</b> and the ring gear <b>32</b> corresponding to their gear ratio. When the motor MG<b>1</b> functions as a motor, on the other hand, the power of the engine <b>22</b> input via the carrier <b>34</b> is integrated with the power of the motor MG<b>1</b> input via the sun gear <b>31</b> and is output to the ring gear <b>32</b>. The power output to the ring gear <b>32</b> is transmitted from the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>through a gear mechanism <b>60</b> and a differential gear <b>62</b> and is eventually output to drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>of the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">The motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are constructed as known synchronous motor generators to enable operations as both a generator and a motor. The motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> transmit electric power to and from a battery <b>50</b> via inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. Power lines <b>54</b> connecting the battery <b>50</b> with the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are structured as common positive bus and negative bus shared by the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. Such connection enables electric power generated by one of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> to be consumed by the other motor MG<b>2</b> or MG<b>1</b>. The battery <b>50</b> may thus be charged with surplus electric power generated by either of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>, while being discharged to supplement insufficient electric power. The battery <b>50</b> is neither charged nor discharged upon the balance of the input and output of electric powers between the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>. Both the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are driven and controlled by a motor electronic control unit (hereafter referred to as motor ECU) <b>40</b>. The motor ECU <b>40</b> inputs various signals required for driving and controlling the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>, for example, signals representing rotational positions of rotors in the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> from rotational position detection sensors <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> and signals representing phase currents to be applied to the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> from current sensors (not shown). The motor ECU <b>40</b> outputs switching control signals to the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. The motor ECU <b>40</b> establishes communication with the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> to drive and control the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> in response to control signals received from the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> and to output data regarding the operating conditions of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> according to the requirements. The motor ECU <b>40</b> also performs arithmetic operations to compute rotation speeds Nm<b>1</b> and Nm<b>2</b> of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> from the output signals of the rotational position detection sensors <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">The battery <b>50</b> is under control and management of a battery electronic control unit (hereafter referred to as battery ECU) <b>52</b>. The battery ECU <b>52</b> inputs signals required for management and control of the battery <b>50</b>, for example, an inter-terminal voltage from a voltage sensor (not shown) located between terminals of the battery <b>50</b>, a charge-discharge current from a current sensor (not shown) located in the power line <b>54</b> connecting with an output terminal of the battery <b>50</b>, and a battery temperature Tb from a temperature sensor <b>51</b> attached to the battery <b>50</b>. The battery ECU <b>52</b> outputs data regarding the operating conditions of the battery <b>50</b> by communication to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> according to the requirements. The battery ECU <b>52</b> also performs various arithmetic operations for management and control of the battery <b>50</b>. A remaining charge or state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b> is calculated from an integrated value of the charge-discharge current measured by the current sensor. An input limit Win as an allowable charging electric power to be charged in the battery <b>50</b> and an output limit Wout as an allowable discharging electric power to be discharged from the battery <b>50</b> are set corresponding to the calculated state of charge SOC and the battery temperature Tb. A concrete procedure of setting the input and output limits Win and Wout of the battery <b>50</b> sets base values of the input limit Win and the output limit Wout corresponding to the battery temperature Tb, specifies an input limit correction factor and an output limit correction factor corresponding to the state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b>, and multiplies the base values of the input limit Win and the output limit Wout by the specified input limit correction factor and output limit correction factor to determine the input limit Win and the output limit Wout of the battery <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows variations of the input limit Win and the output limit Wout against the battery temperature Tb of the battery <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows variations of the input limit correction factor and the output limit correction factor against the state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> is constructed as a microprocessor including a CPU <b>72</b>, a ROM <b>74</b> that stores processing programs, a RAM <b>76</b> that temporarily stores data, input and output ports (not shown), and a communication port (not shown). The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> receives, via its input port, an ignition signal from an ignition switch <b>80</b>, a gearshift position SP or a current setting position of a gearshift lever <b>81</b> from a gearshift position sensor <b>82</b>, an accelerator opening Acc or the driver's depression amount of an accelerator pedal <b>83</b> from an accelerator pedal position sensor <b>84</b>, a brake pedal position BP or the driver's depression amount of a brake pedal <b>85</b> from a brake pedal position sensor <b>86</b>, a vehicle speed V from a vehicle speed sensor <b>88</b>. The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> establishes communication with the engine ECU <b>24</b>, the motor ECU <b>40</b>, and the battery ECU <b>52</b> <b>90</b> via its communication port to receive and send the diversity of control signals and data from and to the engine ECU <b>24</b>, the motor ECU <b>40</b>, and the battery ECU <b>52</b> as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">The hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment constructed as described above sets a torque demand Tr*, which is to be output to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>or the driveshaft, based on the vehicle speed V and the accelerator opening Acc corresponding to the driver's depression amount of the accelerator pedal <b>83</b>, and controls the operations of the engine <b>22</b> and the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> to ensure output of a power demand equivalent to the preset torque demand Tr* to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i>There are several drive control modes of the engine <b>22</b> and the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>. In a torque conversion drive mode, while the engine <b>22</b> is driven and controlled to ensure output of a power equivalent to the power demand, the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are driven and controlled to enable all the output power of the engine <b>22</b> to be subjected to torque conversion by the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> and the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> and to be output to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i>In a charge-discharge drive mode, the engine <b>22</b> is driven and controlled to ensure output of a power corresponding to the sum of the power demand and an electric power required for charging the battery <b>50</b> or an electric power to be discharged from the battery <b>50</b>. The motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are driven and controlled to enable all or part of the output power of the engine <b>22</b> with charge or discharge of the battery <b>50</b> to be subjected to torque conversion by the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> and the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> and to ensure output of a power equivalent to the power demand to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i>In a motor drive mode, the motor MG<b>2</b> is driven and controlled to ensure output of a power equivalent to the power demand to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a, </i>while the engine <b>22</b> stops its operation. In a fuel cutoff drive mode, the fuel supply to the engine <b>22</b> is cut off, and the engine <b>22</b> is motored to keep its rotation by means of the motor MG<b>1</b>. The motor MG<b>2</b> is driven and controlled to ensure output of a power equivalent to the power demand to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">As the control operations of the engine <b>22</b>, the variable valve timing mechanism <b>150</b> is controlled to have the open and close timings of the intake valve <b>128</b> corresponding to the accelerator opening Acc and the torque demand Tr*, while the throttle valve <b>124</b> is controlled to have a throttle opening corresponding to a target torque Te* to be output from the engine <b>22</b>. The fuel injection valve <b>126</b> is controlled to inject a corrected amount of fuel at an adequate timing. The corrected amount of fuel is determined by making diverse corrections on a specific amount of fuel injection set relative to the amount of intake air to attain the stoichiometric air fuel ratio. The corrections include a correction by feedback control based on the air fuel ratio from the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the oxygen content from the oxygen sensor <b>135</b><i>b. </i>The ignition coil <b>138</b> is then controlled to ignite the air-fuel ratio introduced into the combustion chamber at an adequate timing by the spark plug <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0060">The following describes the operations of the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment having the configuration discussed above, especially a series of operation control to detect an abnormality or deterioration of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a. </i>As a matter of convenience, the description sequentially regards general drive control of the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> and abnormality detection for detecting an abnormality of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing a drive control routine executed by the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b>. This drive control routine is performed repeatedly at preset time intervals, for example, at every several msec.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0061">On the start of the drive control routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the CPU <b>72</b> of the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> first inputs various data required for control, for example, the accelerator opening Acc from the accelerator pedal position sensor <b>84</b>, the brake pedal position BP from the brake pedal position sensor <b>86</b>, the vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed sensor <b>88</b>, rotation speeds Nm<b>1</b> and Nm<b>2</b> of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>, the rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b>, and the input limit Win and the output limit Wout of the battery <b>50</b> (step S<b>100</b>). The rotation speeds Nm<b>1</b> and Nm<b>2</b> of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are computed from the rotational positions of the respective rotors in the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> detected by the rotational position detection sensors <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> and are received from the motor ECU <b>40</b> by communication. The rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b> is computed from the crank position detected by the crank position sensor <b>140</b> and is received from the engine ECU <b>24</b> by communication. The input limit Win and the output limit Wout of the battery <b>50</b> are set by the battery ECU <b>52</b> and are received from the battery ECU <b>52</b> by communication.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0062">After the data input, the CPU <b>72</b> sets a torque demand Tr* to be output to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>or the driveshaft linked with the drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>as a torque required for the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> and a power demand Pe* to be output from the engine <b>22</b>, based on the input accelerator opening Acc, the input brake pedal position BP, and the input vehicle speed V (step S<b>110</b>). A concrete procedure of setting the torque demand Tr* in this embodiment stores in advance variations in torque demand Tr* against the vehicle speed V with regard to various settings of the accelerator opening Acc or the brake pedal position BP as a torque demand setting map in the ROM <b>74</b> and reads the torque demand Tr* corresponding to the given accelerator opening Acc or the given brake pedal position BP and the given vehicle speed V from this torque demand setting map. One example of the torque demand setting map is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The power demand Pe* is calculated as the sum of the product of the set torque demand Tr* and a rotation speed Nr of the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a, </i>a charge-discharge power demand Pb* to be charged into or discharged from the battery <b>50</b>, and a potential loss. The rotation speed Nr of the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>is obtained by multiplying the vehicle speed V by a preset conversion factor k or by dividing the rotation speed Nm<b>2</b> of the motor MG<b>2</b> by a gear ratio Gr of the reduction gear <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0063">It is then determined whether the engine <b>22</b> is in operation or is at stop (step S<b>120</b>). When it is determined at step S<b>120</b> that the engine <b>22</b> is in operation, the CPU <b>72</b> identifies the value of an abnormality detection execution flag F<b>2</b> representing execution or non-execution of an abnormality detection process to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of an abnormality of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a </i>(step S<b>130</b>). Upon identification of the abnormality detection execution flag F<b>2</b> equal to 0 representing non-execution of abnormality detection of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a </i>at step S<b>130</b>, the power demand Pe* obtained at step S<b>110</b> is compared with a preset reference value Pstop used as a criterion for stopping the operation of the engine <b>22</b> (step S<b>140</b>). The reference value Pstop is set close to a lower limit value in a power range of ensuring relatively efficient operation of the engine <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0064">When the power demand Pe* is not less than the preset reference value Pstop (step S<b>140</b>: yes), there is a requirement for keeping the operation of the engine <b>22</b>. A target rotation speed Ne* and a target torque Te* defining a target drive point of the engine <b>22</b> are set, based on the power demand Pe* of the engine <b>22</b> (step S<b>150</b>).

This abnormality detection routine is performed repeatedly at preset time intervals, for example, at every several ten msec.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">On the start of the abnormality detection routine, the CPU <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the engine ECU <b>24</b> first inputs various data required for abnormality detection, for example, the setting of an abnormality detection complete flag F<b>1</b>, the state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b>, and the accelerator opening Acc (step S<b>300</b>). The abnormality detection complete flag F<b>1</b> is reset to 0 at a system activation of the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b>, while being set to 1 at step S<b>420</b> (explained later) upon completion of the abnormality detection of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>135</b><i>a. </i>The state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b> is computed from the charge-discharge electric current of the battery <b>50</b> by the battery ECU <b>52</b> and is received from the battery ECU <b>52</b> via the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b>. The accelerator opening Acc is detected by the accelerator pedal position sensor <b>84</b> and is received from the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> by communication.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">After the data input, the CPU <b>24</b><i>a </i>identifies the value of the abnormality detection complete flag F<b>1</b> to determine whether the abnormality detection is still incomplete or is completed (step S<b>310</b>).

When the abnormality detection complete flag F<b>1</b> is equal to 1, the abnormality detection has just been performed and there is no requirement for performing the abnormality detection again. When the engine <b>22</b> is not in operation but is at stop, it is impossible to perform the abnormality detection. When the state of charge SOC of the battery <b>50</b> is lower than the preset reference charge level Sref, the battery <b>50</b> does not have any marginal charge. Execution of the abnormality detection leads to failed output of the torque demand Tr* to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>or the driveshaft. When the accelerator opening Acc is not less than the preset reference opening Aref, there is a high level of the torque demand Tr*. Execution of the abnormality detection leads to failed output of the torque demand Tr* to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>or the driveshaft.

The CPU <b>24</b><i>a </i>accordingly sets the abnormality detection execution flag F<b>2</b> to 1 (step S<b>360</b>) and waits until elapse of a preset reference time Tref (step S<b>370</b>). In response to this setting of the abnormality detection execution flag F<b>2</b> to 1, the drive control routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> identifies the value of the abnormality detection execution flag F<b>2</b> as 1 at step S<b>130</b>.
