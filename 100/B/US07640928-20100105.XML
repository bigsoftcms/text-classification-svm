<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to cutting machines and methods for cutting materials, such as fiber-cement, to form fiber-cement siding used on or in houses and other structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The exterior surfaces of houses and other structures are often protected by exterior siding products made from wood, vinyl, aluminum, bricks, stucco, fiber-cement and other materials. Wood and fiber-cement siding (FCS) products, for example, are generally planks, panels or shakes that are &#x201c;hung&#x201d; on plywood or composite walls. Although wood siding products are popular, wood siding can become unsightly or even defective because it may rot, warp or crack. Additionally, wood siding products are also highly flammable and subject to insect damage. FCS is an excellent building material because it is nonflammable, weatherproof, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Moreover, FCS does not rot and insects do not consume the fiber-cement composites.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a prior art fiber-cement shake panel <b>20</b> having a length L extending along a longitudinal dimension, and a width extending along a transverse dimension that varies along the length L from a width W<sub>1 </sub>to a width W<sub>2</sub>. The shake panel <b>20</b> has side edges <b>23</b> separated from each other by the length L, a top edge <b>22</b> extending along the longitudinal dimension between the upper ends of the side edges <b>23</b>, and a bottom edge <b>24</b> extending along the longitudinal dimension between the bottom ends of the side edges <b>23</b>. The top and bottom edges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are typically substantially parallel to each other and separated by a widthwise dimension (W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2</sub>) of the shake panel <b>20</b>. The shake panel <b>20</b> also includes a web portion <b>32</b> and a plurality of shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of different lengths L<sub>S1</sub>, and L<sub>S2 </sub>projecting from the web portion <b>32</b> and separated by slots <b>28</b>. The shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, accordingly, have widths W<sub>S </sub>corresponding to the distance between slots <b>28</b>. It is particularly important that the lower edge <b>24</b> be a rough, cut edge to give the appearance that the fiber-cement shake panel <b>20</b> is formed of wood and cut with a saw.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A prior art cutting machine <b>34</b> suitable for forming the shake panel <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cutting machine <b>34</b> includes a frame <b>36</b>, a plurality of cutting stations <b>35</b><i>a</i>-<b>35</b><i>d</i>, and a plurality of rollers <b>58</b> for supporting and advancing a sheet of fiber-cement to be cut. The first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a </i>includes a plurality of actuators <b>38</b> attached to the frame <b>36</b> and a driver <b>40</b> projecting from each of the actuators <b>38</b>. The first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a </i>further includes a platform <b>44</b> slidably attached to the frame <b>36</b> and a fixed platform <b>52</b> attached to the frame <b>36</b>. The actuators <b>38</b> are operable to extend and retract the drivers <b>40</b> in order to move the platform <b>44</b> upwardly and downwardly in the direction A. The first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a </i>also includes a upper blade assembly <b>42</b> and a lower blade assembly <b>50</b>. The upper blade assembly <b>42</b> includes a first blade holder <b>46</b> attached to the movable platform <b>44</b> and a first blade <b>48</b> attached to the first blade holder <b>46</b>. The lower blade assembly <b>50</b> includes a second blade holder <b>54</b> attached to the fixed platform <b>52</b>. A second blade <b>56</b> is attached to the second blade holder <b>54</b>. The first and second blades <b>48</b> and <b>56</b> are aligned with each other and, respectively, extend along a length sufficient to singulate a plank from the larger sheet of fiber-cement. The first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a </i>is used to cut a plurality of planks from a larger sheet of fiber-cement and will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The second cutting station <b>35</b><i>b </i>includes a slot cutting assembly <b>53</b> including a blade holder <b>54</b> having a plurality of slot cutting blades <b>56</b> attached thereto. Each of the slot cutting blades <b>56</b> is configured to cut the slots <b>28</b> shown in the shake panel <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The blade holder <b>54</b> is pivotally connected to the frame <b>36</b> and may be rotated between a cutting position and a retracted position in the direction R by extension and retraction of an actuator <b>58</b> coupled to the blade holder <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c </i>includes a cutting assembly <b>63</b> very similar to the cutting assembly <b>53</b> of the second cutting station <b>35</b><i>b</i>. The third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c </i>also includes a blade holder <b>62</b> pivotally connected to the frame <b>36</b> and operable to be rotated in the direction R, as shown, by extension and retraction of an actuator <b>60</b> coupled to the blade holder <b>62</b>. A plurality of slot cutting blades <b>64</b> are attached to the blade holder <b>62</b> and each of the slot cutting blades <b>64</b> are configured to cut the slots <b>28</b> shown in the shake panel <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, as will be discussed in more detail below, in operation, the cutting assembly <b>63</b> is used to cut the slots <b>28</b> in every plank cut from the sheet of fiber-cement except for the slots <b>28</b> cut in the last plank, which are cut by the second cutting assembly <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>is a configured to cut the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the shake panel <b>20</b> in order to vary the lengths (L<sub>S1</sub>, and L<sub>S2</sub>) of the shake sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The cutting assembly <b>65</b> includes a plurality of actuators <b>74</b> attached to the frame <b>34</b> and a driver <b>76</b> projecting from each of the actuators <b>74</b>. The fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>further includes a movable platform <b>66</b> slidably attached to the frame <b>36</b> and a fixed platform <b>72</b> attached to the frame <b>36</b>. The actuators <b>76</b> are operable to extend and retract the drivers <b>76</b> in order to move the platform <b>66</b> upwardly and downwardly in the direction A. The fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>also includes a plurality of first blade assemblies <b>65</b> and second blade assemblies <b>75</b>. Each of the first blade assemblies <b>65</b> includes a first blade holder <b>68</b> attached to the movable platform <b>66</b> and first blade <b>70</b> attached to the first blade holder <b>68</b>. Each of the second blade assemblies <b>75</b> includes a second blade holder <b>74</b> attached to the fixed platform <b>72</b> and a second blade <b>76</b> is attached to the second blade holder <b>74</b>. The first and second blade assemblies <b>65</b> and <b>75</b> are staggered and arranged in transversely spaced apart pairs with their respective first and second blades <b>70</b> and <b>76</b> aligned with each other. Accordingly, the fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>may cut the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the shake panel <b>20</b> to vary the length.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in operation, a fiber-cement sheet <b>80</b> is provided and advanced along a path P<sub>1 </sub>to the first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a</i>. The sheet <b>80</b> includes first and second edges <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> each having a length equal to L, and side edges <b>86</b>, all of which are very smooth because they were cut using a process such as water jet cutting. The sheet <b>80</b> may be cut into a plurality of planks <b>90</b><i>a</i>-<b>90</b><i>e</i>. Although five planks <b>90</b>-<b>90</b><i>e </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sheet <b>80</b> may be cut into a different number of planks depending on the size of the sheet <b>80</b> and the planks to be cut therefrom. At the first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a</i>, the sheet <b>80</b> is cut into a first plank <b>90</b><i>a </i>along a cutting plane C<sub>1 </sub>and is advanced to the third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c</i>. At the third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c</i>, the slots <b>28</b> are formed in the first plank <b>90</b><i>a </i>and the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is formed. Simultaneously, with advancing the first plank <b>90</b><i>a </i>to the third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c</i>, the sheet <b>80</b> is advanced along the path P<sub>1 </sub>to align cutting plane C<sub>2 </sub>thereof with the first and second blades <b>48</b> and <b>54</b> of the first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a</i>. A second plank <b>90</b><i>b </i>is cut from the sheet <b>80</b> along a cutting plane C<sub>2 </sub>using the first cutting station <b>35</b><i>a</i>. The second plank <b>90</b><i>b </i>is advanced along the path P<sub>1 </sub>to the third cutting station <b>35</b><i>c </i>where the slots <b>28</b> are cut in second plank <b>90</b><i>b </i>to form the shake panel <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>thereof. If desired, as the slots <b>28</b> are being formed in the plank <b>90</b><i>b</i>, the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be advanced in the direction P<sub>1</sub>to the fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>where the length of the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>thereof may be trimmed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This process is continuously repeated until the fifth/last plank <b>90</b><i>e </i>is ready to have the slots <b>28</b> formed therein. The upstream edge <b>84</b> of the fifth plank <b>90</b><i>e </i>has a factory edge that was cut using a technique such as water jet cutting, which produces a very smooth edge. However, consumers would like the edge <b>24</b> of the shake panel <b>20</b><i>e </i>to have a rough cut edge giving the appearance of a wood product cut with a saw. Thus, the fifth plank <b>90</b><i>e </i>is advanced to the second cutting station <b>35</b><i>b </i>along the path P<sub>1 </sub>and the slot cutting assembly <b>53</b> cuts the slots <b>28</b> in the fifth plank <b>90</b><i>e </i>that extend widthwise inwardly toward the factory edge <b>84</b>. In order to advance the formed shake panel <b>20</b><i>e</i>, the rollers <b>58</b> are stopped and then the shake panel <b>20</b><i>e </i>is moved in an opposite direction along the path P<sub>2</sub>. Then, the slot cutting assembly <b>35</b><i>b </i>is pivoted to its retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The process of forming the slots <b>28</b> in the last plank <b>90</b><i>e </i>using the second cutting station <b>35</b><i>b </i>reduces the speed at which shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>may be cut from the sheet <b>80</b> because the shake panel <b>20</b><i>e </i>is stopped and then moved in reverse in the direction along the path P<sub>2 </sub>in order to retract the cutting assembly <b>53</b>. Additionally, the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the last shake panel <b>20</b><i>e </i>cannot be trimmed using the fourth cutting station <b>35</b><i>d </i>due to the orientation of the shake sections relative to the blade assemblies <b>65</b> and <b>75</b> thereof. Furthermore, if each of the shake sections have a uniform length, the operator manually rotates the last shake panel <b>20</b><i>e </i>in order to stack it with the slots <b>28</b> oriented in the same direction of the shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>d</i>. If the shake sections have different lengths (L<sub>S1</sub>, and L<sub>S2</sub>), the operator stacks the shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>d </i>in one pile and stacks the shake panels <b>20</b><i>e </i>having shake sections <b>30</b> of uniform length in another pile.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, there is still a need in the art for a more efficient cutting machine and method suitable for forming shake panels in which the bottom edge of the shake sections have a rough, cut surface finish. It would also be desirable that in such a cutting machine and method that the operator does not have to laboriously manually rotate the shake panels in order to stack them all in the same orientation. Moreover, it would be desirable that the cutting machine and method can cut shake panels, from a given a sheet, that all have the same shake section configuration.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention is directed to cutting machines and methods for cutting materials, such as fiber-cement. In one aspect of the invention, a method of cutting a sheet of fiber-cement and cutting machine programmed to effect such a method is disclosed. The method includes aligning a cutting plane of the sheet with at least one blade of a first cutting station. The sheet is cut along the cutting plane to sever a strip therefrom. A plank is formed either by the act of severing the strip from the sheet or by advancing the sheet to align another cutting plane of the sheet and cutting the sheet along the cutting plane with the at least one cutting blade. The plank so formed is advanced along a path to a second cutting station.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention is directed to cutting machines and methods for cutting fiber-cement materials to form structures, such as shake panels. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 11</figref> in order to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the invention may have additional embodiments, or that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description. In the figures and description that follow, like elements and features are identified by like reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side elevation view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an isometric view of a cutting machine <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The cutting machine <b>100</b> is suitable for cutting workpieces formed of fiber-cement having cement, silica sand, and cellulose fiber constituents to form shake panels of various geometries such as, for example, the shake panel <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Of course, the cutting machine <b>100</b> may be configured to cut shake panel geometries different than that of the shake panel <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the shake sections <b>30</b> may have different lengths and the width of the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be different.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cutting machine <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>102</b> and may include three different cutting stations configured to perform different cutting operations on a sheet of material or a plank or siding piece cut therefrom. The cutting machine <b>100</b> also has a conveyor assembly, which will be discussed in more detail below, operable to move a workpiece along a path P between the three different cutting stations. The three different cutting stations include a plank cutting station <b>104</b>, a slot cutting station <b>106</b>, and a shake section cutting station <b>108</b>. The plank cutting station <b>104</b> includes a platform <b>118</b> slidably attached to the frame <b>102</b> and a plurality of actuators <b>110</b>. Each of the actuators <b>110</b> has a driver <b>111</b> projecting therefrom that is operably coupled to the platform <b>118</b>. The plank cutting station <b>104</b> also includes a plank cutting assembly <b>130</b> having a upper blade assembly <b>129</b> mounted on the platform <b>118</b> and a lower blade assembly <b>131</b> mounted on the frame <b>102</b>. The actuators <b>110</b> may extend and retract the drivers <b>111</b> to move the platform <b>118</b> and the upper blade assembly <b>129</b> carried by it along a stroke path A between a release position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, and a cutting position to cut a plank from a larger sheet of material. In one embodiment, the actuators <b>110</b> may be electrically driven cams. In another embodiment, the actuators <b>110</b> may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders and the drivers <b>111</b> may be rods or shafts. In another embodiment, the drivers <b>111</b> may be ball screws that threadly engage the platform <b>118</b>. In yet another embodiment, the actuators <b>110</b> may be linear actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The slot cutting station <b>106</b> is positioned downstream from the plank cutting station <b>104</b> and includes a slot cutting blade assembly <b>150</b> configured to cut slots in a plank cut by the plank cutting station <b>104</b>. The slot cutting blade assembly <b>150</b> may be pivotally mounted to the frame <b>102</b> so that it may be rotated between a retracted position and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a downward cutting position. The slot cutting assembly <b>150</b> includes a blade holder <b>154</b> that carries a plurality of cutting blades <b>162</b> and a die <b>160</b> with corresponding slots therein (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The shake section cutting station <b>108</b> may be positioned downstream from the slot cutting station <b>106</b>. The shake section cutting station <b>108</b> includes a platform <b>198</b> slidably attached to the frame <b>102</b> and a plurality of actuators <b>110</b>. Each of the actuators <b>110</b> has a driver <b>111</b> projecting therefrom that is operably coupled to the platform <b>198</b>. The shake section cutting station <b>108</b> also includes a plurality of shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b>. The shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b> are configured to trim the length of the shake sections of a siding panel. As with the plank cutting station <b>104</b>, the actuators <b>110</b> may extend and retract the drivers <b>111</b> to move the platform <b>198</b> and the cutting assemblies carried by it along a stroke path A between a release position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, and a cutting position to cut shake sections in a shake panel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cutting machine <b>100</b> also includes a controller <b>103</b> containing a program instructions stored in memory that may be used to control the operation of the various components of the cutting machine <b>100</b> such as, the cutting stations <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> and the conveyor assembly. The controller <b>103</b> may be configured to enable the operator to change the program of instructions, perform diagnostics, fine tune the cutting machine <b>100</b>'s operation, among other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as briefly discussed above, the cutting machine <b>100</b> includes a conveyor assembly operable for supporting and moving a workpiece between the plank cutting station <b>104</b>, slot cutting station <b>106</b>, and shake section cutting station <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the conveyor assembly includes a plurality of lower rollers <b>114</b> and a plurality of upper rollers <b>116</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), each of which rotates about a rotational axis R-R transverse to the path P. The lower rollers <b>114</b> may be grouped in sets of lower rollers <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>i </i>that are spaced apart from each other along the path P and mounted to the frame <b>102</b>. The upper rollers <b>116</b> may also be grouped in sets of upper rollers <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>i </i>that are mounted to the frame <b>102</b> and also rotate about respective rotational axes R-R (not shown) to cooperate with the corresponding lower rollers <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>i </i>for moving a workpiece along the path P. The upper rollers <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>g </i>may be formed of a resilient, deformable material that will not permanently damage a workpiece formed of fiber-cement. The conveyor assembly may further includes a plurality of belts <b>124</b> extending about the lower rollers <b>114</b><i>c</i>-<b>114</b><i>g </i>and spaced apart along the rotational axes R-R. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the belts <b>124</b> extend over the die <b>160</b> and between slots <b>162</b> thereof of the slot cutting blade assembly <b>150</b>. The conveyor assembly may also include components for selectively tensioning the belts <b>124</b> an appropriate amount.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, a sheet of fiber-cement is supported on the lower rollers <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>i </i>and belts <b>124</b> and disposed between the lower roller <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>i </i>and the upper roller <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>i </i>while it is transported along the path P by a drive system (not shown) effecting rotation of the lower rollers <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>g</i>. The upper rollers <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>i </i>downwardly press against the sheet to help prevent it from slipping transversely to the path P when it is moved along the path P and when it is cut at one of the cutting stations <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b>. The position of the sheet may be detected using optical detectors (not shown) that are configured to detect when the sheet has reached a particular cutting station <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, or <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in another embodiment, the location of the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> and the slot cutting station <b>106</b> may be reversed. Thus, in such an embodiment, the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> is positioned upstream from the slot cutting station <b>106</b> and receives a plank from the plank cutting station <b>104</b> and cut shake sections therein. The slot cutting station <b>108</b> receives the plank from the shake cutting station <b>108</b> and cuts slots therein between adjacent shake sections. In yet another embodiment, the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> may be eliminated. Of course, such an embodiment would not be as versatile as the cutting machine <b>100</b> for forming shake panels having a variety of different shake section geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which shows an enlarged side isometric view of the plank cutting station <b>104</b> and the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b> according to one embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As discussed above, the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b> includes the upper blade assembly <b>129</b> mounted on the platform <b>118</b> and the lower blade assembly <b>131</b>. The upper blade assembly <b>129</b> includes blade holders <b>142</b> and <b>145</b> attached to the platform <b>118</b>. The blade holders <b>142</b> and <b>145</b> hold an upper blade <b>146</b> having a cutting edge <b>148</b> extending transversely across the path P. The lower blade assembly <b>131</b> includes blade holder portions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> mounted to an intermediate plate <b>132</b>. The intermediate plate <b>132</b> may be mounted to a base plate <b>107</b>, which may be slidably mounted over a section of the frame <b>102</b>. The base plate <b>107</b> may be slid along a section of the frame <b>102</b> in a direction transverse to the path P to facilitate removal and installation of the second cutting assembly <b>131</b>. The blade holder portions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> hold a lower blade <b>138</b> having a cutting edge <b>140</b> that opposes and is generally aligned with the cutting edge <b>148</b> of the first blade <b>145</b>. The lower rollers <b>114</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>c </i>are positioned laterally adjacent to the plank cutting station <b>104</b> and vertically so that a sheet may be positioned between the first and second cutting assemblies <b>129</b> and <b>131</b> and supported a selected distance above the cutting edge <b>140</b> of the lower blade <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the blade holder portion <b>136</b> includes a slanted surface <b>147</b> and the intermediate plate <b>132</b> also includes a slanted surface <b>149</b>, both of which extend along their respective lengths. The slanted surface <b>149</b> extends so that an edge thereof may overlie an edge of the base plate <b>107</b> and a section of the frame <b>102</b> that the lower blade assembly <b>131</b> is mounted over. Thus, the slanted surface <b>147</b> and the slanted surface <b>149</b> are generally coplanar with each other and define a pathway in which strips severed from a sheet on the upstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b> of the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b> may fall downwardly on the upstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b> to the ground or to a waste disposal conveyor (not shown) situated below the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in operation, a sheet of fiber-cement is supported on the lower rollers <b>114</b>, the number of rollers <b>114</b> that support the sheet being dependent upon the length of the sheet, and the upper blade <b>146</b> is driven into a first side of the sheet to bend the sheet toward the lower blade <b>138</b> until the lower blade <b>138</b> engages an opposing second side of the sheet whereby the sheet is fractured or cut along a cutting plane transverse to the path P. In another mode of operation, a strip of a sheet of fiber-cement may also be trimmed or severed from sheet on the upstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b> by positioning the sheet on the downstream rollers <b>114</b><i>c</i>-<b>114</b><i>e </i>and the belts <b>124</b> extending thereover, and severing the unsupported portion of the sheet on the upstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b>. This severed portion may fall downwardly on the upstream side the lower blade <b>138</b> to the ground or to a waste disposal conveyor (not shown) situated below the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an enlarged isometric view of the slot cutting assembly <b>150</b> according to one embodiment. The slot cutting assembly <b>150</b> includes a support arm <b>152</b> that is attached to the frame <b>102</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). A blade holder <b>154</b> is pivotally mounted to the support arm <b>152</b> via a shaft (not shown). The blade holder <b>154</b> has a plurality of slot cutting blades <b>158</b> attached thereto, and may rotate between a retracted position and a cutting position under actuation by an actuator operably coupled to the shaft. In various embodiments, the actuator may be a hydraulic actuator, pneumatic actuator, a linear actuator, or an electrically driven cam. The slot cutting assembly <b>150</b> further includes the die <b>160</b> having the plurality of slots <b>162</b> formed therein spaced apart to correspond to the spacing of the slot cutting blades <b>158</b>. Although the slot cutting blades <b>158</b> and corresponding slots <b>162</b> in the die <b>160</b> are shown evenly spaced apart to form the slots <b>28</b> shown in the shake panel <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the slot cutting blades <b>158</b> and corresponding slots <b>162</b> may be spaced apart so that the spacing of the slots <b>28</b> (W<sub>S</sub>) of the shake panel <b>20</b> may be different for some or all of the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the shake panel <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the belts <b>124</b> previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> also extend over the die <b>160</b> and between the slots <b>162</b>. Upper wheels <b>156</b> are mounted to the blade holder <b>154</b> and aligned with one of the belts <b>124</b>. The upper wheels <b>156</b> may also be formed from a resilient, deformable material that presses against the top of a sheet being cut to prevent it from slipping transversely to the path P. The blade holder <b>154</b> also has a plurality of cutouts <b>163</b> formed therein so that upper wheels <b>156</b> are received by a corresponding one of the cutouts <b>163</b> and when the blade holder <b>154</b> is rotated, the upper wheels <b>156</b> do not physically interfere with the rotation of the blade holder <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in operation, the plank so cut at the plank cutting station <b>104</b> is moved along the path P by the lower rollers <b>114</b> and belts <b>124</b> to the die <b>160</b> of the slot cutting assembly <b>150</b> when the blade holder <b>154</b> is in its upward retracted position. The blade holder <b>154</b> rotates downwardly so that the slot cutting blades <b>158</b> penetrate through the plank and are received into corresponding slots <b>162</b> formed in the die <b>160</b>. After cutting, the blade holder <b>154</b> is pivoted upwardly to its retracted position. The shake panel <b>20</b> so cut at the slot cutting station <b>108</b> may be moved along the path P when the blade holder <b>154</b> is in its cutting position or retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an enlarged side isometric view of the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> and a plurality of shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>thereof according one embodiment. Each of the shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>are laterally spaced apart from each other. Each of the shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>includes a corresponding upper blade assembly mounted on the platform <b>198</b> and lower blade assembly mounted on the frame <b>102</b>. The shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>also includes a corresponding lower holder portion <b>164</b><i>a</i>-<b>164</b><i>d </i>and <b>166</b><i>a</i>-<b>166</b><i>d </i>that hold a corresponding lower blade <b>172</b><i>a</i>-<b>172</b><i>d </i>having an edge <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<b>174</b><i>d </i>(although only edge <b>174</b><i>a </i>is labeled for clarity). The shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>also includes a corresponding upper holder portion <b>168</b><i>a</i>-<b>168</b><i>d </i>and <b>170</b><i>a</i>-<b>170</b><i>d </i>that hold a corresponding upper blade <b>176</b><i>a</i>-<b>176</b><i>d </i>having a corresponding edge <b>178</b><i>a</i>-<b>178</b><i>d</i>. Similar to the plank cutting assembly <b>130</b>, the edges <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<b>174</b><i>d </i>are aligned with and opposite a corresponding one of the edges <b>178</b><i>a</i>-<b>178</b><i>d</i>. However, each of the shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>are selectively positioned along the path P to cut and define the shake sections to a selected geometry on a shake panel cut at the slot cutting station <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the particular arrangement and number of the shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>may be varied depending upon the desired shake pattern and geometry. For example, the shake cutting assemblies <b>123</b><i>a</i>-<b>123</b><i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are configured to trim the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the shake panel <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the length L<sub>S1</sub>. In addition to the configuration of the shake cutting station <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>9</b>, the shake cutting station <b>108</b> may be adapted to cut shake sections having rounded ends, scalloped ends, or another desired configuration. One suitable cutting apparatus to enable cutting such geometries is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,386 to Fladgard et al., which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> schematically illustrates a method of manufacturing the shake panel <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to one embodiment of the invention.

Of course, the sheet <b>200</b> and the planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>may be sized accordingly so that more than or less than three planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>may be cut from a sheet of fiber-cement <b>200</b>, depending upon the desired width of the shake panels <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the sheet <b>200</b> is moved along the path P by the conveyor assembly to the plank cutting station <b>104</b> so that the cutting plane C, is aligned with the lower blade <b>138</b> and upper blade <b>146</b> thereof. The plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>is cut from the sheet <b>200</b> along the cutting plane C<sub>1</sub>. Thereafter, the plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b>. As the plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b>, the sheet <b>200</b> is advanced to a position in which the cutting plane C<sub>2 </sub>is aligned with the lower blade <b>138</b> and upper blade <b>146</b> of the plank cutting station <b>104</b>. Accordingly, as the plank <b>202</b><i>b </i>is being cut from the sheet <b>200</b> at the plank cutting station <b>104</b>, slots <b>28</b> are cut in the plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>at the slot cutting station <b>106</b> to form a shake panel <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b>, the plank <b>202</b><i>b </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b> and the sheet <b>200</b> having a width W<sub>O </sub>is advanced to align the cutting plane C<sub>3 </sub>with the lower blade <b>138</b> and upper blade <b>146</b> of the plank cutting station <b>104</b>. The plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>is cut from the sheet <b>200</b> along the cutting plane C<sub>3 </sub>to a width W<sub>1</sub>, thus, severing a strip <b>204</b> from the rear of the sheet <b>200</b>. Width <b>215</b> of the strip <b>204</b> may be approximately 0.25 inches to approximately 0.5 inches. The strip <b>204</b> may slide downwardly along the slanted surfaces <b>147</b> and <b>149</b> of the lower blade assembly <b>131</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to the ground or a waste disposal conveyor. Accordingly, the plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>has a rough, cut bottom edge <b>208</b>, giving the appearance that the plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>is formed of wood and cut with a saw. As the plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>is being cut, shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>are also cut to length L<sub>S1</sub>, at the shake cutting station <b>108</b> in the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the slots <b>28</b> are cut in the plank <b>202</b><i>b </i>to form a shake panel <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thereafter, the shake panel <b>20</b><i>b </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> to cut the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b> to have the slots <b>28</b> cut therein to form a shake panel <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Next, the shake panel <b>20</b><i>c </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> where the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>are trimmed to length. In the embodiments in which shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>have shake sections of equal length, the act of cutting the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>at the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic cutting diagram illustrating another embodiment of a method of manufacturing the shake panel <b>20</b>. In this method, instead of the strip <b>204</b> being severed from the last plank <b>202</b><i>c</i>, the strip <b>204</b> is severed from the first plank <b>202</b><i>a</i>. In such an embodiment, the slot cutting station <b>106</b> is configured to cut slots in the planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>that extend widthwise inwardly from the downstream, longitudinal edge of the planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>in a direction generally opposite to the path P. Accordingly, the plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>has a width W<sub>0 </sub>and the strip <b>204</b> may be severed from the first plank <b>202</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After severing the strip <b>204</b> along the cutting plane C<sub>1</sub>, at the plank cutting station <b>104</b>, the sheet <b>200</b> is advanced and cut along the cutting plane C<sub>2 </sub>at the plank cutting station <b>104</b> to form the plank <b>202</b><i>a</i>. The plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b> and slots <b>28</b> are cut therein to form the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>while the sheet <b>200</b> is advanced and cut along the cutting plane C<sub>3 </sub>at the plank cutting station <b>104</b> to form the planks <b>202</b><i>b </i><b>202</b><i>c</i>. Then, as the shake panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> and the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>are trimmed to length L<sub>S1</sub>, the plank <b>202</b><i>b </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b> and the slots <b>28</b> are cut therein to form shake panel <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Thereafter, the shake panel <b>20</b><i>b </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> and the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>are trimmed to length L<sub>S1</sub>, and the plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>is advanced to the slot cutting station <b>106</b> and the slots <b>28</b> are cut therein to form the shake panel <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Finally, the shake panel <b>20</b><i>c </i>is advanced to the shake section cutting station <b>108</b> and the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>are trimmed to length.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the strip <b>204</b> severed from the first plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>includes the downstream, front edge <b>212</b>. In order to allow the strip <b>204</b> to fall downwardly and out of the way of the advancing planks <b>202</b><i>b </i>and <b>202</b><i>c</i>, the lower blade assembly <b>131</b> of the plank cutting station <b>104</b> is modified from the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The positions of the blade holder portions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are reversed. The blade holder portion <b>136</b> is positioned on the downstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b>. The slanted surface <b>147</b> of the blade holder portion <b>136</b> and the slanted surface <b>149</b> of the intermediate plate <b>132</b> slant downwardly away from the lower blade <b>138</b>. This allows the strip <b>204</b> severed from the first plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>on the downstream side of the lower blade <b>138</b> to fall downwardly to the ground or to a waste disposal conveyor situated below the lower blade assembly <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, the embodiments of the methods described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> enable continuously advancing the sheet <b>200</b> and the planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>cut therefrom along the path P. Additionally, the methods provide a cut bottom edge <b>208</b> on the last plank <b>202</b><i>c </i>or the upstream longitudinal edge of the first plank <b>202</b><i>a </i>cut from the sheet <b>200</b> in addition to the other planks. This provides the bottom edges <b>208</b> of the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of all the shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>cut from the planks <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>the appearance of being formed of wood and cut with a saw. Furthermore, the shake panels <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>so formed are all oriented in the same direction when they are advanced along the path P after cutting the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, the cutting machine <b>100</b> enables cutting shake panels <b>20</b> from the sheet <b>200</b> all having the same shake section configuration. The aforementioned embodiments for cutting machine <b>100</b> and the methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> also enable cutting shake panels without generating a substantial amount of hazardous dust particles formed from the constituents of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted, that the cutting operations to define the slots <b>28</b> and the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be reversed. For example, in another embodiment of a method, the shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be cut in the planks <b>202</b> before the slots <b>28</b> are cut and the slots <b>28</b> cut thereafter between adjacent shake sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, as previously discussed, a variety of different shake geometries may be cut at the shake cutting station <b>108</b> such as rounded or scalloped shake sections.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the invention has been described with reference to the disclosed embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although the cutting machine has been described as suitable for use in cutting fiber-cement materials, it may be used to cut and define shapes in workpieces formed of other materials, such as ceramics and other cement compositions. Such modifications are well within the skill of those ordinarily skilled in the art. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
