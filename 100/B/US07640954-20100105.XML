<p id="p-0005" num="0006">The invention is directed to such a filler head that is simple and convenient to use while providing an arrangement that is economical to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">To that end it provides a head characterized in that said passage aperture is provided in an oblique wall or wall portion, with the angular offset between the orientation of said obturator in said obturating position and the transverse orientation being at least equal to 20&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">With respect to conventional filler heads in which the passage aperture is provided in a wall oriented transversely (perpendicularly to the axial direction), and with identical force at the start of driving the obturator by the spout (same lever arm with respect to the flapping axis of the obturator), the force exerted at the end of introducing the spout into a filler head in accordance with the invention is reduced, since the angular travel of the obturator is reduced and since the returning couple provided by the spring elastically biasing the obturator is proportional to the angular travel of the obturator.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">The force to exert by the user to fully insert the supply spout into the filler head thus remains moderate, including at the end of the movement of insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Similarly, at the time of the withdrawal of the spout from the filler head, the force exerted by the obturator on the spout remains moderate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Furthermore, the biasing spring of the obturator may have smaller dimensions than in the conventional filler heads.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0030">According to other preferred features, the head further comprises an access assembly having a shell through which the spout must pass before reaching the obturator, said shell having a plurality of flexible tabs generally forming an assembly of funnel shape of which the minor diameter is less than said outer diameter of said spout and of which the major diameter is greater than said outer diameter of said spout.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0031">Thrusting in of the spout from the front to the rear causes flexing of the tabs, which move apart from each other to allow the spout to pass.

<p id="p-0023" num="0047">The head <b>10</b> comprises an obturating assembly <b>12</b> and an access assembly <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0048">In the operating configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the head <b>10</b> obturates the pipe <b>11</b> whereas, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, by a simple thrusting movement starting from the operating configuration, the head <b>10</b> allows the passage of the spout <b>14</b> of a supply nozzle for an appropriate fuel, the fuel being diesel here, through assembly <b>13</b> and then assembly <b>12</b>, in order to reach the filling position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in which the distal end of the spout <b>14</b> communicates with the interior space of the pipe <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0049">The obturating assembly <b>12</b> is situated at the rear (the side which is seen downwards in the drawings) and is provided to be inserted into the end of the pipe <b>11</b>, the access assembly <b>13</b> being itself disposed to the front of the head <b>10</b> (the side which is seen upwards).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0050">The obturating assembly <b>12</b> will now be described in detail.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0052">The main body <b>15</b> is of relatively rigid plastics material molded as a single piece. It has a side wall <b>20</b> the general form of which is tubular with a circular section. A rim <b>21</b> of generally annular form projects transversely outwardly at the front end of the wall <b>20</b>. Within the side wall <b>20</b> a separating wall <b>22</b> is disposed. The entirety of the periphery of the separating wall <b>22</b> is connected to the side wall <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0053">Wall <b>22</b> has a transversely oriented section <b>23</b> and an obliquely oriented section <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0054">Section <b>23</b> is disposed at the front end of the body <b>15</b>, at the same level as the rim <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0055">Section <b>24</b> is disposed between the section <b>23</b> and the side wall <b>20</b>. The portion of section <b>24</b> situated remote from section <b>23</b> is approximately at mid-length of the body <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0056">In section <b>24</b> there is provided an aperture <b>25</b> serving for the passage of the spout <b>14</b>. No other aperture is provided in wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0057">At the rear side, the perimeter of the aperture <b>25</b> serves as a seat for the obturator <b>16</b>, which serves to close the aperture <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0058">At the front side, a guide <b>26</b> in the form of an arch projects from a portion of the perimeter of the aperture <b>25</b> that is the closest to the front end of the body <b>15</b>. The inner surface of the guide <b>26</b> is curved and is connected to the edge of the aperture <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0059">The side wall <b>20</b> has an axially oriented internal rib <b>27</b>, extending from the front end of the body <b>15</b> to a portion of the perimeter of the aperture <b>25</b> that is the furthest from that front end. Rib <b>27</b> and guide <b>26</b> are diametrically opposite.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0060">The inner surface of rib <b>27</b> is curved and is connected to the edge of the aperture <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0061">On the opposite side from rib <b>27</b>, the side wall <b>20</b> has a recess <b>28</b>, for molding considerations (uniformity of wall thickness).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0062">On the inside, in the vicinity of the rear end, wall <b>20</b> has bosses <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>) for snap-fitting with the obturator support <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0063">At the front and on the outside, body <b>15</b> comprises two diametrically opposite snap-fitting feet <b>29</b>&#x2032;, which are able to flex inwardly into a housing in the form of a cut-out.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0064">Feet <b>29</b>&#x2032; serve for the mutual snap-fitting of the assembly <b>12</b> and of the pipe <b>11</b>: in the latter, to accommodate feet <b>29</b>&#x2032; two rectangular windows are provided (not visible in the drawings) in the vicinity of the front end.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0065">An annular recess <b>30</b> is formed on the outside in the side wall <b>20</b>, situated at the rear end of body <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0066">Recess <b>30</b> serves to house the O-ring seal <b>31</b>, which is provided to be disposed between the body <b>15</b> and the pipe <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0067">This obturator support <b>17</b> is of relatively rigid plastics material molded as a single piece. It has a side wall <b>32</b> the general form of which is tubular with a circular section. A rim <b>33</b> of generally annular form projects transversely outwardly at the rear end of the wall <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0068">The front end of the support <b>17</b> is formed like the wall <b>22</b> of body <b>15</b>: the front edge of the side wall <b>22</b> has a transversely oriented portion <b>34</b> and an obliquely oriented portion <b>35</b>, portion <b>34</b> being formed as the perimeter of portion <b>23</b> of wall <b>22</b> whereas portion <b>35</b> is formed like the perimeter of portion <b>24</b> of wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0069">On the inside of wall <b>32</b>, in the vicinity of portion <b>34</b> of its front end, two diametrically opposite bosses <b>36</b> project. In each boss <b>36</b> there is formed a hole <b>37</b> which also passes through the side wall <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0070">The holes <b>37</b> are aligned along a chord close to the periphery of the side wall <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0071">An opening <b>38</b> of relatively large dimensions is formed in the side wall <b>32</b> in a position overhung by the bosses <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0072">Windows <b>39</b> are formed near the rim <b>33</b> for receiving a boss <b>29</b> of the body <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0073">The obturator <b>16</b> comprises a closure <b>40</b> of relatively rigid plastics material molded in one piece and an O-ring <b>41</b> of elastomer plastics material molded in one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0074">The closure <b>40</b> has the general form of a circular plate. From its lateral surface an annular rim <b>42</b> projects of which each end is connected to a respective lug <b>43</b>, which lugs <b>43</b> are disposed parallel to each other and each have a hole <b>44</b>, which holes <b>44</b> are aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0075">At the front of the rim <b>42</b> an annular groove is provided receiving the seal <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0076">The hinge pin <b>18</b> is of steel here. Its general form is that of a small rod of circular section.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0077">The spring <b>19</b> is of spring steel here. It comprises a helical central portion <b>45</b> from which project, on one side, a hair pin portion <b>46</b>, and, from the other side, two arms <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0078">In the assembled state, hinge pin <b>18</b> is disposed in the holes <b>37</b> and <b>44</b> as well as inside the helical portion <b>45</b> of the spring <b>19</b>, which portion <b>45</b> is disposed between the lugs <b>43</b>, each lug <b>43</b> being disposed against a boss <b>36</b>, the portion <b>46</b> of the spring <b>19</b> being disposed at opening <b>38</b> and bearing by its end on the wall <b>20</b> whereas the arms <b>47</b> are disposed against the rear face of the rim <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0079">Once the obturator <b>16</b>, the support <b>17</b>, the hinge pin <b>18</b> and the spring <b>19</b> have been thus assembled, the support <b>17</b> is engaged in the main body <b>15</b>, from the rear, until the front end (edges <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>) of the wall <b>32</b> arrive against the rear face of the separating wall <b>22</b> and until the bosses <b>29</b> engage within the windows <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0080">The support <b>17</b> and the body <b>15</b> are then connected to each other, the spring <b>19</b> applying the obturator <b>16</b> against the wall <b>22</b>, the seal <b>41</b> more particularly bearing on the perimeter of the aperture <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0081">The access assembly <b>13</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0082">This assembly comprises a cover <b>50</b>, a shell <b>51</b> for resisting the withdrawal of the spout and a shell support <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0083">The cover <b>50</b> is of relatively rigid plastics material molded as a single piece. It comprises a side wall <b>53</b> the general form of which is tubular with a circular section. From the rear side, the side wall <b>53</b> connects to a skirt <b>54</b> of generally stepped form.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0084">Skirt <b>54</b> comprises a transversely oriented wall <b>55</b>, an axially oriented wall <b>56</b> and a transversely oriented rim <b>57</b>. Rim <b>57</b> is disposed at the rear end of the cover <b>50</b>. The wall <b>56</b> is disposed between the rim <b>57</b> and the wall <b>55</b>, the latter being disposed between the wall <b>56</b> and the wall <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0085">At the front, wall <b>53</b> connects to a generally transversely oriented wall <b>58</b>, having a circular aperture <b>59</b> surrounded by a bead <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0086">Side wall <b>53</b> and skirt <b>54</b> are coaxially disposed to each other. Aperture <b>59</b> is eccentric with respect to side wall <b>53</b>. The outline of bead <b>60</b> is of smaller diameter than that of the wall <b>68</b>, with a point of tangency between their two outlines, such that there is a portion <b>61</b> of the wall <b>58</b> of crescent shape disposed between the bead <b>60</b> and the side wall <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0087">In wall <b>56</b> of skirt <b>56</b> there are formed snap-fitting detents <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0088">Shell <b>51</b> is of relatively rigid plastics material molded as a single piece. It comprises a side wall <b>65</b> the general form of which is tubular with a circular section and flexible tabs <b>66</b> disposed within the side wall <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0089">As can be seen more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the tabs <b>66</b> form a funnel-shaped assembly which, at its major diameter, on the outside, connects to the front end of the side wall <b>65</b> whereas the minor diameter is free and is situated at the same level as the rear end of the side wall <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0090">Tabs <b>66</b> are separated from each other by radially oriented slots, here spaced apart angularly by 45&#xb0; (the illustrated embodiment comprises eight tabs <b>66</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0091">Each tab has a uniform or approximately uniform thickness between its free end (rear end) and its end attached to the side wall <b>65</b> (front end), the side wall <b>65</b> having a similar thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0092">It will be noted that the minor diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs <b>66</b> is, on the inside, less than the outer diameter of the spout <b>14</b> of the type which the filler head <b>10</b> is provided for cooperating with, being here the spout of a diesel supply nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0093">On the other hand, the major diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs <b>66</b> is greater than the outer diameter of that spout <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0094">Thus, thrusting in of the spout <b>14</b> from the front to the rear causes flexing of the tabs <b>66</b>, which move apart from each other to allow the spout <b>14</b> to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095">When spout <b>14</b> is then imparted with a movement of withdrawal (rear to front), the tabs <b>66</b> are moved by the spout and press strongly against it, so producing a braking effect to the withdrawal of the spout <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0096">The support <b>52</b> is of relatively rigid plastics material molded as a single piece. It comprises a tubular side wall <b>67</b> of circular section and a transverse wall <b>68</b> connecting to the rear end of the side wall <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0097">The outline of the wall <b>68</b> is circular and of greater diameter than that of the wall <b>67</b>, these two walls being off-center with respect to each other, with a point of tangency between their two outlines, such that wall <b>68</b> presents a crescent shape outside wall <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">The portion of the wall <b>68</b> situated within wall <b>67</b> has a central aperture <b>69</b> slightly larger than the outer diameter of the spout <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">Within the bead <b>60</b> of the cover <b>50</b> there is provided a groove <b>70</b> for receiving the front end of the wall <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">In the assembled state of assembly <b>13</b>, the shell <b>51</b> is disposed in the support <b>52</b>, which support <b>52</b> is disposed in the cover <b>50</b>, the bead <b>60</b> and the side wall <b>67</b> being coaxially disposed, wall <b>68</b> being located at the level of wall <b>55</b> of the skirt <b>54</b> (see in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">The diameter of the aperture <b>59</b> corresponds to the major diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0102">The diameter of the side wall <b>53</b> of the cover <b>50</b> corresponds to the diameter of the side wall <b>20</b> of the main body <b>15</b>, which corresponds to the inner diameter of the pipe <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0103">The inner diameter of the wall <b>67</b> is greater than the outer diameter of the wall <b>65</b>. The diameter of the aperture <b>69</b> is smaller than the inner diameter of the wall <b>65</b> and greater than the inner diameter of the portion of minor diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104">Thus, shell <b>51</b> can be disposed in support <b>52</b> with the rear end of wall <b>65</b> bearing on the portion of wall <b>68</b> situated within wall <b>67</b> and with the portion of minor diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly facing aperture <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0105">The play then existing between the outer surface of wall <b>65</b> and the inner surface of wall <b>67</b> enables the shell <b>51</b> to be positioned appropriately when it cooperates with a spout <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0106">For its assembly with head <b>10</b>, pipe <b>11</b> comprises, at its front end, an annular rim <b>71</b> of the same diameter as the annular rim <b>21</b> of the main body <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0107">The inner diameter of the side wall <b>56</b> of the skirt <b>54</b> of the cover <b>50</b> is slightly greater than the diameter of the annular rims <b>21</b> and <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0108">In the assembled state of head <b>10</b>, support <b>52</b> bears by its wall <b>68</b>, on the front end of the main body <b>15</b> whereas the cover <b>50</b> bears on that same end by the wall <b>55</b> of the skirt <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0109">In the assembled state of the filler head <b>10</b> and pipe <b>11</b>, the front face of the rim <b>71</b> bears against the rear face of the rim <b>21</b>, the withdrawal of the pipe <b>11</b> being prevented by the snap-fitting detents <b>62</b>, which abut with the rear face of rim <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0110">The cooperation between the supply spout <b>14</b> and the filler head <b>10</b> will now be described with the aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0111">Spout <b>14</b> penetrates the head <b>10</b> via the aperture <b>59</b>, of which the diameter is greater than that of the spout <b>14</b> and similar to the diameter of the major diameter end of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs <b>66</b> of the shell <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0112">The funnel-shaped assembly guides the spout <b>14</b> towards the aperture <b>69</b> of the support <b>52</b> and, since the minor diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly is smaller than the diameter of the spout <b>14</b>, the tabs <b>66</b> deform by flexing such that the minor diameter portion of the funnel-shaped assembly bears strongly around the spout <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0113">As indicated above, the play existing between the shell <b>51</b> and the support <b>52</b> enables the shell <b>51</b> to be positioned optimally whatever the orientation of the spout <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0114">Once the distal end of the spout <b>14</b> has passed through the aperture <b>69</b>, it encounters the guide <b>26</b> or the rib <b>27</b> (according to the orientation of the spout), and finally comes to meet the obturator <b>16</b>, which is then driven by the spout <b>14</b> to flap rearwardly and outwardly until it is fully disposed laterally to spout <b>14</b> which may then go beyond the obturator <b>16</b> and reach the filling position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0115">It will be observed that apertures <b>59</b>, <b>69</b> and <b>25</b> being eccentric with respect to pipe <b>11</b> enables a space to be cleared laterally of spout <b>14</b> to accommodate the obturator <b>16</b> in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0116">Due to the fact that the separating wall <b>22</b>, and more particularly its section <b>24</b>, is obliquely disposed, the angular travel of the obturator <b>16</b> between the obturating position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the freeing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is relatively reduced, such that the force to exert at the end of the introduction of the spout <b>14</b> is also reduced (the returning couple provided to the obturator <b>16</b> by the spring <b>19</b> is proportional to the angle through which the obturator <b>16</b> flaps).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0117">It will be observed that the opening <b>38</b> has sufficiently large dimensions to enable the closure <b>40</b> of the obturator <b>16</b> to be accommodated there, which is favorable to the compactness of the head <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0118">When withdrawal of the spout <b>14</b> from the filler head <b>10</b> is performed, the spout first of all slides along the obturator <b>16</b>, and then the latter acts on the distal end of that spout. A force in the direction of withdrawal is thus exerted relatively abruptly on the spout <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0119">The rubbing of the tabs <b>66</b> against the spout gives a braking effect which slows the movement of withdrawal of the spout and avoids it being ejected abruptly.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0120">In a variant not shown, the diameters of the different members through which the fuel supply spout passes are different, in order to be able to cooperate with a spout of different diameter, in particular a spout of smaller diameter provided for distributing unleaded gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0121">In the example illustrated, the angular offset between the orientation of the obturator <b>16</b> in the obturating position and the transverse orientation is of the order of 35&#xb0;, but in variants not illustrated, that offset is different, while remaining at least equal to 20&#xb0;, or even at least equal to 20&#xb0; and at most equal to 50&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0122">In other variants not shown, the materials of certain members are different, the hinge pin <b>18</b> being for example replaced by a hinge pin of plastics material; the arrangement of certain members is different, the wall as at <b>22</b> being for example entirely obliquely oriented, the end of minor diameter of the funnel-shaped assembly formed by the tabs as at <b>66</b> being for example situated at a level different from the rear end of the wall <b>65</b>, the inner surface of the rib as at <b>27</b> being for example straight rather than curved; and/or the association of the different members is made differently, the access assembly being for example joined to the obturating assembly by ultrasonic welding rather than by snap-fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">In still another variant not shown, the access assembly <b>13</b> is different, or even no access assembly is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0124">Numerous other variants are possible according to circumstances, and in this connection it is to be noted that that the invention is not limited to the examples described and shown.</p>
