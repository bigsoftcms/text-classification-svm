<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is a division of patent application Ser. No. 09/829,772, filed Apr. 10, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,983,788.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to ventilating systems and methods using heat-exchangers for energy recovery, and to heat exchangers, especially exchangers suitable for use in such systems, and to methods for fabricating heat exchangers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The ventilating systems of the above-identified patent applications represent significant improvements over prior ventilating systems. Nonetheless, further improvements are desirable, and it is an object of this invention to provide them.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One embodiment of the ventilating system of the above patent applications uses evaporative cooling to cool exhaust air exiting a building or other conditioned space. Although the evaporative cooling feature significantly enhances the efficiency of cooling the conditioned space, even greater cooling is highly desirable, as long as power and equipment costs are not increased excessively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior energy-recovery ventilating systems and others using isolating heat-exchangers, that is, heat-exchangers which isolate the gas flows from one another, often suffer from the effects of leakage in the heat exchanger. This leakage causes undesired mixing of the two gases from one another. In a ventilating system, this can mean that the stale exhaust air mixes with the incoming fresh air, and leads to reduced air quality and even contamination of the incoming fresh air.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A third problem occurs with the preferred heat exchanger used in my above-described prior system. That heat-exchanger is made out of extruded thermoplastic panels composed of side-by-side plastic tubes. The heat-exchanger is admirably suited to use with evaporative cooling equipment because mold and other such nemeses do not adhere strongly to the heat-exchanger surfaces, and can be removed relatively easily. Also, the heat-exchanger is relatively inexpensive to build and lasts much longer than most metallic heat-exchangers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A problem with such heat-exchangers is that most are relatively less efficient in the transfer of heat than they could be.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem is that such prior heat-exchangers usually require relatively expensive housings, often made of sheet-metal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further problem is that such prior heat-exchangers usually are assembled using hand labor, and thus are more time-consuming and expensive to make than they need be.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing problems are solved or alleviated by the provisions of a ventilating system and method which includes evaporative cooling of the exhaust air before it enters a heat exchanger to cool incoming fresh outside air. A suction fan pulls exhaust air through the heat exchanger and, in combination with a flow restrictor, reduces the pressure on the exhaust air and augments the evaporative cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, another fan is used to push outside air through the heat-exchanger and into the conditioned space.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The use of a pusher fan to force outside air through the heat exchanger ensures that any leakage in the heat-exchanger results in outside air entering exhaust air and minimizing the chances of contamination by leaking exhaust air into the incoming fresh air.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The heat exchanger is made economically by die-forming cavities in relatively thick thermo-plastic sheets, interleaving them with other thermo-plastic sheets having separate gas flow conduit structures, and securing the sheets together. Preferably, the heat-exchanger is an opposed-flow heat-exchanger giving improved heat-transfer efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, some or all of the sheets are panels of parallel, side-by-side thermoplastic tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one specific embodiment, the tubes in every other sheet are left intact and serve as conduits for one gas, such as outside air, while the other sheets are indented to form separate conduits for another gas, such as exhaust air.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another specific embodiment, the sheets indented to form gas flow passages are panels made of expanded thermoplastic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further specific embodiment, all of the panels have gas flow conduits formed by indenting the sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the outside edges of the sheets stacked together are hot-compressed, with a heated roller, e.g. to melt the plastic of the edges to form a relatively thick outer wall which is strong and helps avoid the cost of a metal housing for the heat-exchanger. Flame singeing is used to fuse the ends of gas flow conduits together.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The sheets are secured together, broad-face to broad-face, either with silicone adhesive, or preferably, by heat-singeing at least one broad surface of one of the sheets to make it tacky before another sheet is pressed against the tacky surface to adhere the sheets together.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Vanes are die-formed in some of the gas flow passages to increase turbulence and heat-transfer efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Die forming can be done with heated or cool dies, depending upon the type of panel being used and its condition&#x2014;whether hot and soft or cool and hard, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of the heat-exchanger <b>20</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The heat-exchanger <b>20</b> has opposed broad side walls <b>22</b>, and top and bottom walls <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heat-exchanger has an upper angular extension <b>28</b> defining an upper inlet/outlet <b>30</b>, and a lower angular extension <b>32</b> defining a lower inlet/outlet <b>34</b> connected internally to the upper inlet/outlet <b>30</b>. The inlet/outlets <b>30</b> and <b>34</b> and the internal passageways (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) interconnecting them form a first gas flow conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second gas flow conduit is formed by inlet/outlets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> at the right and left ends of the heat-exchanger, and internal passageways (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) interconnecting them.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the various inlet/outlets <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> is capable of being used either as an inlet or outlet for the flow of gases through the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As it will be explained in detail below, the two gas flow conduits are constructed to be parallel to one another over a substantial portion of their lengths so as to produce counter-flow heat exchange when the gases flow in opposite directions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Panel Construction</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The heat-exchanger <b>20</b> is made of a plurality of vertical panels or sheets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> interleaved with and secured to one another preferably in alternating sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side elevation view of one of the panels <b>40</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a similar view of one of the panels <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The panels <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are cut to have relatively long, straight parallel upper and lower edges with upper and lower angular extensions <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, and <b>63</b> and <b>65</b>, respectively. The extensions are of the same size and shape so as to form the extensions <b>28</b> and <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) when the panels are assembled together.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, both panels <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are made of &#x201c;sign-board&#x201d; material, whose construction is shown in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each panel <b>40</b> has relatively thin opposed outside walls <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> with broad surfaces, and elongated integral tubes <b>53</b> of rectangular or square cross-section formed between two walls <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. The panels are believed to be extruded from a thermoplastic material such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polystyrene. Sign-board material typically is used as relatively lightweight, strong and inexpensive material for making signs or displays.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The structure of each panel <b>42</b> is substantially the same as the structure of panel <b>40</b>, and consists of outside walls <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> and tubes <b>43</b>. The panels may be thicker than panels <b>40</b>, and the tubes <b>43</b> larger in cross-sectional area than the tubes <b>52</b>, so as to facilitate the flow conduit formation process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the broad surfaces <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> of each panel <b>42</b> are indented in selected areas to form a pair of gas flow cavities <b>66</b>. Preferably, the indentations are made by means of dies such as the dies <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The dies preferably are heated in order to permanently deform the panel material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the panels <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> and assembled together with broad surfaces contacting one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, gas flow passageways or conduits <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> are formed. Heat is transferred between the gas in conduits <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> and a single-thickness wall <b>56</b> of each adjacent panel <b>40</b>. This is an advantage over prior heat exchangers in which heat is transferred through multiple wall thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the indentations compress the internal walls of the tubes together to form a two-ply wall <b>84</b> in the center of the panel <b>42</b>, with ribs <b>86</b> extending outwardly at the locations of the compressed internal walls.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, vanes <b>76</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are formed in the gas flow cavities <b>66</b> by the provision of cavities in the dies <b>13</b> and <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), which has the effect of leaving the panel material uncompressed and projecting outwardly from the two-ply wall <b>84</b>. The vanes <b>76</b> are arranged to serve as baffles to ensure the turbulent flow of gas along sinuous paths <b>80</b> through the conduits <b>67</b> and <b>69</b>, thus increasing the heat transfer efficiency of the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optional guide and support vanes <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are formed by the same process as the vanes <b>76</b> to divide the inlet section of each cavity <b>66</b> into the passageways <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>. The vanes <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> help to direct the flow of air through the conduits <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> first horizontally, from right to left, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and then outwardly and downwardly through the outlet passageways <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The vanes <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> also help to support the adjacent portions of panels <b>40</b> to maintain a constant spacing of the panels from one another over the relatively broad span of the inlet and outlet openings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An alternative panel construction <b>88</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Panel <b>88</b> is an alternative to the panel <b>40</b> for conducting the gas flow from one end <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the opposite end <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Panel <b>88</b> has one or more indentations <b>94</b> with vanes <b>96</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> formed by the same process as the vanes <b>76</b>. The dashed lines <b>97</b> indicate the locations of rows of added vanes <b>96</b>, which are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for the sake of simplification of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The vanes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are provided in order to support the adjacent panels in the heat-exchanger, and to guide gases into and out of the flow passages of the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the cross-sectional shape of one of the vanes <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The advantage of the panel <b>88</b> over the panel <b>40</b> is that the gas flow through the conduits is turbulent, thus further increasing the heat-transfer efficiency of the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although it is preferred that the gas flow cavities in the panels be formed by indenting both broad side walls of the panels to form a central two-ply web <b>84</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, alternatively, the panels can be indented from only one side to form the gas flow cavity <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing this alternative construction. The panel which is indented has broad side walls <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> with tubes <b>52</b>. The panel is heat-compressed to form a gas flow passageway in the area <b>112</b>, and a two-ply wall <b>113</b> with ridges <b>114</b> at the locations of the compressed inner walls.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Heat is transferred between the gas in the conduit <b>112</b> and that flowing in the tubes <b>52</b> of the adjacent panels <b>40</b>. Although heat is transferred through only one wall thickness in the case of the wall <b>56</b>, heat must flow through the two-ply wall <b>113</b> and wall <b>54</b>, when being transferred between conduit <b>112</b> and the right-hand panel conduits <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This potential reduction in heat transfer efficiency, as compared with the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> embodiment, can be acceptable as a compromise to avoid having to make two sets of heat-forming dies or heat-forming both sides of the panels in separate steps using the same dies, if the extra die cost is avoided by using the same dies to form both sides of one panel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The heat transfer reduction can be minimized by reducing the internal and external wall thickness of the panels <b>88</b>, and by removing substantial sections of the two-ply wall <b>113</b> at many locations (e.g. <b>115</b>&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), in the panel shaping process.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The panels <b>40</b> utilize the tubes <b>52</b>, which extend the whole length of the panel, as gas flow conduits. However, the panels <b>42</b> and <b>88</b> do not use the tubes to conduct gas. Instead, the panels are merely used as low-cost thermoplastic sheet material from which to form gas flow conduits. It is possible to use other sheet materials instead for the starting sheets for forming the panels <b>42</b> and <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, it is believed that sheets of expanded thermoplastic materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polystyrene can be used instead of the &#x201c;sign-board&#x201d; material. Such sheet materials are widely used as insulating panels in home construction, as flotation materials for floating docks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a broken-away cross-section of a panel of expanded thermoplastic material <b>117</b> compressed at <b>119</b> to form gas flow cavities <b>121</b> and <b>123</b>. This construction can be easier and less expensive to make than that using sign-board as the starting material for all panels.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Similarly, other compressible and/or heat-formable sheets may be advantageous to use as starting materials. For example, expanded or solid thermo-plastic sheets, still hot after being formed, can be stamped or molded rapidly to provide the desired gas flow cavities without the heating of dies. Some materials may be subject to permanent deformation by the use of cool dies alone. It also is within the scope of the invention to use those materials as alternatives.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Assembly of Panels</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The next step in making the heat-exchanger <b>20</b> after cutting and forming the panels is to adhere the panels together, with broad surfaces contacting one another, in alternating sequence. That is, for example, a panel <b>40</b> forms one side wall <b>22</b> of the heat-exchanger, and a panel <b>42</b> is secured to it. The next panel is another panel <b>40</b>, the next is another panel <b>42</b>, etc. The other side wall <b>22</b> of the heat-exchanger would be another panel <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The panels are adhered to one another with silicone adhesive, or by use of the process partially illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, several flaming jets <b>124</b> are pointed downwardly from burner nozzles <b>126</b> fed with fuel (e.g., natural gas) from a manifold <b>132</b>. The flames are played onto the upper surface of one of the panels <b>40</b> while the panel is moved past the flames in the direction <b>134</b> at a controlled speed so as to &#x201c;singe&#x201d; the upper surface <b>56</b> of the panel <b>40</b>. This slightly melts or softens the upper surface of the panel. Then, the next panel is placed on top of the first panel, either with or without singeing the surface which is to make contact with the first panel, and the panels are pressed together and allowed to cool to cause them to adhere.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This process then is repeated for each subsequent panel added to the stack until a pre-determined number of layers has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The panels can be held together by many other methods and structures.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, metal clamps can be formed out of metal angles and cross rods (not shown) clamping the panels together.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another assembly method which is believed to be feasible, under some circumstances, is to simply clamp the panels together temporarily until the edges of the panels are fused together, in the manner to be described below, and then removing the clamps, with the fused edges being sufficient to hold the panels together.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Edge Fusing</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the preferred method of forming the top and bottom walls <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the panels are stacked together, the edges are aligned with one another to form straight surfaces. Then, a heated roller <b>118</b> is pressed firmly against the upper edges <b>116</b> of the panels while the panels are moved as indicated by the arrow <b>120</b>. This progressively compresses and melts the upper edges of the panels, and the melted plastic is rolled by the roller to form a solid wall of melted plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The panels then are turned over to use the same process to form the opposite wall.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Alternatively, a second heated roller (not shown), spaced vertically from the roller <b>188</b> can be used simultaneously to form the top and bottom walls in one pass of the panels through the heated roller mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Many types of heated rollers can be used, such as ultrasonically-heated rollers or rollers heated with electrical resistance heating.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The edges of the panels at the four inlet/outlets <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are fused together by flame singeing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, without closing or significantly reducing the size of the gas inlet/outlet openings.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A flame array like that shown in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is used. The array is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in a side elevation view to show the features of each flame <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The flame <b>124</b> is a jet of burning gas moving downwardly in the direction of the arrows <b>128</b>. The position and thrust of the jet are adjusted so that just the bottom portion of the flame touches the upper edges <b>122</b> of the panel assembly as the assembly is moved past the flame array in the direction of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The dwell time of the flames on the panel edges is controlled empirically to limit the melting of the panel end to just enough to fuse the adjacent panel ends together without significantly closing the gas passageways in the panels.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Other means can be used to fuse the ends and edges of the panels together, such as heated rollers and like devices.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The fused top and bottom walls <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, and the fused edges of the panels at the inlet/outlet locations produce a strong heat-exchanger structure which is capable of supporting itself without a separate housing, thus saving substantial costs for sheet metal and sheet metal fabrication as compared with comparable prior heat-exchangers.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The heat-exchanger <b>20</b> is weather-resistant, highly corrosion-resistant, relatively easy to keep clean, and efficient, as well as being relatively economical to make.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Ventilation System</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a partially-schematic side-elevation view of a ventilation system utilizing the heat-exchanger <b>20</b> of the invention to ventilate a building or other conditioned space <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As in my patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,305, a first fan <b>144</b> is positioned at the left inlet end <b>38</b> of the heat-exchanger to push outside air (&#x201c;OSA&#x201d;) through the heat-exchanger and out of the outlet <b>36</b> and into the conditioned space <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The outside air flows as indicated by the arrows <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> through an opening <b>149</b> in the wall <b>151</b> of a building and a fitting <b>147</b> secured to the left end of the heat-exchanger, and out through another fitting <b>153</b> secured to the right end of the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Curved fittings <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> fit over the angular extensions <b>28</b> and <b>32</b> of the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Mounted inside of outlet fitting <b>156</b> is a duct fan <b>142</b> which acts as a suction fan to pull exhaust air thorough inlet duct <b>154</b> and the heat-exchanger and expel the air through an exhaust outlet <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At the exhaust inlet end of the heat-exchanger is a motorized damper <b>152</b>, a water spray nozzle <b>150</b>, and a porous mat <b>158</b> onto which the spray nozzle <b>150</b> sprays water to create evaporative cooling of the exhaust air, when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In accordance with the present invention, either the fiberglass mat <b>158</b> or the damper <b>152</b>, or a combination of both is used to create a restriction to the inflow of exhaust air into the heat-exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Use of the damper <b>152</b> is preferred so as to minimize the restriction caused by the mat <b>158</b>, especially when evaporative cooling is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The exhaust fan <b>142</b> preferably is a centrifugal duct fan which occupies the full width of the duct <b>156</b> and is capable of creating a substantial pressure drop. The combination of this suction fan with the flow restriction creates a significant pressure drop in the exhaust air entering the heat-exchanger. This is believed to significantly increase the evaporation of water and, hence, the evaporative cooling of the exhaust air.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another advantage of this ventilating system is that it provides resistance to the leakage of exhaust air into the incoming fresh air through any leaks which may exist in the heat-exchanger. This is because the exhaust air in the heat-exchanger is at a lower pressure than the outside air, and any leaks would allow flow from the higher pressure conduits to the low pressure conduits, but not in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Thus, stale air is not allowed to mix to any significant degree with the fresh air coming into the conditioned space. Although this is highly desirable in any residential or commercial building, it is especially advantageous in hospitals or doctor's offices where it is important to prevent such mixing in order to prevent the spreading of pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Preferably, the heat-exchanger <b>20</b> is mounted with the right end slightly higher than the left so that the body of the heat-exchanger forms an angle &#x3b8; of around 5 degrees with horizontal. This promotes drainage of condensate and excess water from the evaporative cooling system towards the left end <b>38</b></p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A gutter <b>162</b> is provided in the duct <b>156</b> to catch the water draining from the exhaust passageways of the heat-exchanger. The water gathered there flows through a line <b>168</b> to an optional waste water recovery facility (not shown) which returns the water for re-use in evaporative cooling, or elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A float valve <b>164</b> is provided. It closes the drain system until the water level in the tank of the valve <b>164</b> reaches a level sufficient to overcome the negative pressure of the fan <b>142</b>. This prevents the drain from leaking air into the fitting <b>156</b> and reducing the effectiveness of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A similar gutter <b>166</b> and drain <b>170</b> are provided at the right end of the heat-exchanger, if needed. A similar gutter and drain can be provided at the left end of the heat-exchanger, if needed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> preferably also has suitable control means for controlling the operation of the ventilator in heating, cooling and intermediate cooling modes, as described in my above-identified patent and pending patent application. Louvers, bypass ducts, de-icing means, etc., described there all can be used in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The above description of the invention is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. Various changes or modifications in the embodiments described may occur to those skilled in the art. These can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.</p>
