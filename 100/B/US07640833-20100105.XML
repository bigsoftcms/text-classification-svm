<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-119935 filed on Apr. 18, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a molding body having a groove or grooves thereon, on which at least one groove is formed by turning.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, there are molding bodies having a predetermined groove or grooves thereon, such as an inserted plate having grooves thereon that is installed inside a mold in order to form a cylindrical lens having grooves formed on a convex surface or a concave surface thereof along its circumferential direction, or to form a prism sheet for use in a backlight device of a liquid crystal display. As a method of manufacturing a molding body having grooves thereon, such as the above-mentioned inserted plate, there has been known a method to rotate a sheet-like workpiece which is wound around a jig in substantially solid cylindrical shape, and a plurality of substantially V-shaped grooves (defined by a shape of an outer edge of a tip) that extend along a circumferential direction of the workpiece are formed substantially in parallel each other by bringing the tip into contact with an outer peripheral face of the workpiece, as disclosed in JP-A-2001-315001.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a method of manufacturing a molding body having grooves thereon, v-shaped slope faces of the respective grooves are normally formed to be the same in angle. However, recently, it has been requested that these slope faces of the grooves be formed with different angles respectively, as desired. In order to satisfy the above-mentioned request, there have been considered two methods as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one method, a tip C<b>1</b>, having a narrow width and having a rake face C<b>11</b> with a sharply pointed end, is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. In this method, by tracing slope faces of virtual grooves Di&#x2032; at a front end of the tip C<b>1</b>, the angles of the slope faces of the respective grooves Di can be formed into different angles as desired, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second method, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a tip C<b>2</b> of which the rake face C<b>21</b> has a somewhat larger front end angle &#x3b1; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), is inclined with the front end thereof fixed as an anchor point so that a base end portion of the rake face C<b>21</b> approaches a workpiece W. Accordingly, the angle of the slope faces of the groove Di can be changed as desired. In this method, because by inclining the tip C<b>2</b>, the cross-sectional shape of the groove Di at a predetermined position (for example, the front end position of the tip C<b>2</b>) is formed as if the front end shape of the tip C<b>2</b> at the predetermined position is projected into the workpiece W, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>, so that the angle of the slope face of the groove Di can be changed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the first method has a disadvantage that the slope faces of the groove Di are formed by the sharply pointed front end of the tip C<b>1</b>, which brings difficulties in obtaining a good surface roughness. In the second method, a good surface roughness can be obtained since the groove Di is cut by using side edges of the tip C<b>2</b>. However, in order to incline the tip C<b>2</b> with the front end thereof fixed as the center, the front end of the tip C<b>2</b> must agree accurately with the rotation center of a jig that rotatably supports the tip C<b>2</b>, and this center-positioning work is extremely tedious. Particularly, in forming a diffractive element, the rotation center of the jig and the front end of the tip C<b>2</b> have to agree with each other within an error range of 100 nm or less, which is substantially impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, it has been needed to provide a method of manufacturing a molding body having a groove or grooves thereon, which enables slope faces of grooves to be formed with good surface roughness and enables angles of slope faces of grooves to be changed easily.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a molding body having at least one groove thereon. The method is performed by rotating a workpiece, allowing a tip to contact with an outer peripheral or an inner peripheral face, so as to form the groove in accordance with a shape of an outer edge of the tip, and shifting a position of the tip along an orthogonal direction relative to a rake face of the tip without changing a direction of the rake face thereof, so as to form another groove having a different angle from that of the shape of the outer edge of the tip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a molding body having at least one groove thereon, and the method is performed by the steps of</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A: rotating a workpiece having a curved face with a predetermined curvature;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">B: forming a first groove; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">C: changing a relative position between the tip and the workpiece. In the step of A, the workpiece is rotated about a rotation axis which</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">agrees with a center of the curvature of the curved face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the step B, the first groove is formed in such a manner that, while an angle of the rake face of the tip relative to a plane including the rotation axis is fixed in a direction orthogonal to the plane, the workpiece and the tip are converged and the tip is engaged with the curved face of the rotating workpiece so as to form on the curved face the first groove defined by the outer edge shape of the tip, and a direction and depth of the engagement of the tip with the curved face of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the step C, the relative position between the tip and the workpiece is changed by translating the position of the tip in the direction orthogonal to the rotation axis and parallel to the plane.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above-mentioned method is performed further by the steps of</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A: stopping rotation of the workpiece and replacing the workpiece with a second workpiece having a curved face with a predetermined curvature, and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">B: rotating the second workpiece about a rotation axis which agrees with a center of the curvature of the curved face thereof; and C: forming a first groove.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the step B, a third groove is formed, following shifting the relative position between the tip and the workpiece, in such the manner that, while the angle of the rake face of the tip relative to the plane including the rotation axis is fixed in the orthogonal direction to the plane, the second workpiece and the tip are allowed to approach each other, and then the tip is engaged with the second curved face of the second rotating workpiece so as to form on the second curved face of a third groove defined by the outer edge shape of the tip, and a direction and depth of the engagement of the tip with the second curved face of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Other aspect, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following specification and claims when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter, with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a turning device S has, as main components, a tool portion Sa including a turning tool <b>10</b>, and a head portion Sb onto which a solid cylindrical workpiece W is mounted. Details of the respective portions will be described below. Note that, for the sake of convenience, the workpiece W and a tip <b>11</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in an proportion in size that differs from that of the actual dimensions. The actual size relationship of the workpiece W and the tip <b>11</b> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Tool Portion]</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The tool portion Sa is mainly constituted of the turning tool <b>10</b> having the tip <b>11</b>, and this turning tool <b>10</b> is detachably fixed to a base (not shown in the drawing).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The turning tool <b>10</b> is mainly constituted of the tip <b>11</b> and a shank <b>13</b> (also referred to as a tip holder or main turning tool body), onto which the tip <b>11</b> is detachably mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tip <b>11</b> is formed so as to have a tapered front end portion that is pressed against the workpiece W. A front end shape <b>11</b><i>g </i>(so-called &#x201c;front end R&#x201d; or &#x201c;R&#x201d;) of the tip <b>11</b> is formed to have an infinitely small radius and a predetermined angle &#x3b1; at a front end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tip <b>11</b> further includes a rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>on one face thereof, which is mostly used for cutting the workpiece W. At the front end portion of the tip <b>11</b>, a first flank <b>11</b><i>b </i>and a second flank <b>11</b><i>c </i>for avoiding interference of the tip <b>11</b> with the workpiece W are formed in continuation to the above-mentioned the front end shape <b>11</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, a bolt hole <b>11</b><i>h </i>is formed at a base end portion of the tip <b>11</b>, so that the tip <b>11</b> can be detachably mounted to a tip holding portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the shank <b>13</b> by a bolt (not shown in the drawing). The method of fixing the tip <b>11</b> to the shank <b>13</b> is not limited to this method by using a bolt, and, for example, a brazing method, etc., may be used instead. The tip <b>11</b> is fixed to the shank <b>13</b> in such a manner that the rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>thereof faces upward, so that the rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>is fixed substantially orthogonally to the rotation direction of the workpiece W (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the shank <b>13</b> is an arm in a substantially inverted L shape, and has the tip holding portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>for holding the tip <b>11</b> at one end thereof. The other end of the shank <b>13</b> is detachably fixed to the base (not shown in the drawing).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">[Head Portion]</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The head portion Sb includes, as main components, a moving stage <b>31</b> for shifting the relative positions between the workpiece W and the tip <b>11</b> in three directions and a chuck <b>32</b> for rotating the workpiece W.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The moving stage <b>31</b> includes a front/rear movement, a left/right movement and an up/down movement mechanisms that are not shown in the drawing, whereby the moving stage <b>31</b> can be movable in three of front/rear, left/right and up/down directions relative to the tool portion Sa. That is, as shown by the coordinate axes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the moving stage <b>31</b> is allowed to move along a Z-axis of the front/rear direction parallel to a main axis line of the head portion Sb, and along an X-axis of the left/right direction and a Y-axis of the up/down direction that are orthogonal to the Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The chuck <b>32</b> is the portion onto which the solid cylindrical workpiece W is mounted. The chuck <b>32</b> holds the workpiece W by means, for example, of a vacuum chuck or a plurality of jaws (not shown in the drawing, and also referred to as claw or collets). The chuck <b>32</b> is rotatably mounted onto the moving stage <b>31</b> so as to rotate at a predetermined speed by a driving motor (not shown in the drawing), etc. Note that the chuck <b>32</b> rotates at a normal rotation speed that is relatively high.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The workpiece W is a material used for a molding body having grooves thereon (for example, a roller-shaped mold used in rolling and forming a resin material into a predetermined shape). That is, the workpiece W is worked so as to form a plurality of grooves <b>5</b> along a circumferential direction of an outer peripheral face <b>4</b> thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>. The respective grooves <b>5</b> are formed to have different angles thereof, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A method for manufacturing a molding body having grooves thereon by using the above-described turning device S will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first, the chuck <b>32</b> is driven to rotate the workpiece, and the workpiece W is moved by means of the moving stage <b>31</b>, so that the front end of the tip <b>11</b> is set at a first processing position P<b>1</b> (to be specific, a position slightly apart from the workpiece W) that is substantially horizontal to the center of the workpiece W, as indicated by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It can be deemed that the tip <b>11</b> moves relative to the workpiece W if the workpiece W is moved by the moving stage <b>31</b>, as described above. However, only a description will be provided simply on the relative movement of the tip <b>11</b> with respect to the workpiece W, omitting a description of the movement of the workpiece W by the moving stage <b>31</b> for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the positioning the tip <b>11</b> at first processing position P<b>1</b> as mentioned above, the tip <b>11</b> is allowed to prick the outer peripheral face <b>4</b> of the workpiece W by a predetermined amount, so that the workpiece W is cut by the side edges of the front end portion of the tip <b>11</b> so as to form a groove <b>5</b>A (groove with the angle &#x3b1; defined by the two slope faces) corresponding to the outer edge shape of the tip <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Thereafter, the tip <b>11</b> is departed from the workpiece W once, and after moving the tip <b>11</b> downward (in the direction substantially orthogonal to the rake face <b>11</b><i>a</i>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and toward this side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the tip <b>11</b> is moved to a second processing position P<b>2</b> (to be specific, a position slightly apart from the workpiece W).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that angles &#x3b8;<b>1</b> and &#x3b8;<b>2</b> are defined by the workpiece W and the rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>at the processing positions P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, respectively, to be specific, by tangents TL<b>1</b> and TL<b>2</b> of the workpiece W and the rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>at the positions P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, respectively, such that &#x3b8;<b>2</b> becomes less than &#x3b8;<b>1</b>. Thus, the tip <b>11</b> is inclined in such a manner that the base end portion thereof approaches the workpiece W at the second processing position P<b>2</b>. Accordingly, a groove <b>5</b>B with an angle &#x3b1;&#x2032; that is greater than that of the groove <b>5</b>A formed at the first processing position P<b>1</b> is formed in a cross section along the radial direction of the workpiece W, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the workpiece W and the tip <b>11</b> are expressed in different sizes from the actual ones thereof. Both are illustrated in the relationship of the actual sizes thereof in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, as lower the height position of the tip <b>11</b> is shifted every time a groove <b>5</b> is processed, an angle of a groove <b>5</b> (<b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, . . . ) gradually becomes greater toward a lower position. Here, the height position of the tip <b>11</b> is preferably set within the range of a lower half of the workpiece W so that the tip <b>11</b> does not interfere with the workpiece W at a corner portion on the back side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the rake face <b>11</b><i>a </i>thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The angle of the groove <b>5</b> is easily determined by using the following equation:</p>

where &#x3b2; is an angle of the groove, R is a radius of the workpiece, Y is a tip height (moving distance of the tip in the direction orthogonal to the rotation axis and parallel to the plane), D is a depth of the groove, &#x3b1; is an angle of the front end of the tip.
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The angle &#x3b2; of the groove <b>5</b> can be easily determined according to the angle &#x3b1; of the tip <b>11</b>, by using the above equation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the present embodiment provides the following effects:</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The slope faces of each groove <b>5</b> can be formed by the outer edges of the front end of the tip <b>11</b>, so that slope faces of the groove <b>5</b> can be formed to have good surface roughness.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Simply by changing the height position of the tip <b>11</b> without changing the angle of the tip <b>11</b>, the angle of the slope faces of the groove <b>5</b> can be changed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment and can be put into practice in various modes.</p>
