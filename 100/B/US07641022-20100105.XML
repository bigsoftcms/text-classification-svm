<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an improvement in a motor-driven power steering unit support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A motor-driven power steering unit support structure according to the background art is known, wherein a motor-driven power steering device is supported by brackets attached to a vehicle body frame (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2663454).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> in Japanese Patent No. 2663454 show that a steering shaft <b>7</b> is supported by an upper-side frame pipe <b>101</b> and a lower-side frame pipe <b>102</b> which constitute a vehicle body frame <b>1</b>. The steering shaft <b>7</b> is divided into an upper side <b>7</b><i>a </i>and a lower side <b>7</b><i>b</i>. A motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> is interposed between the upper side <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the lower side <b>7</b><i>b</i>. The power steering device <b>8</b> is mounted onto the upper-side frame pipe <b>101</b> through brackets <b>9</b>. With the above construction, the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> is supported in the axial direction of the steering shaft <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the background art, if the steering shaft <b>7</b> is supported at two upper and lower positions of the vehicle body frame <b>1</b>, a mounting error may be generated in mounting the steering shaft <b>7</b> due, for example, to production errors in the upper-side frame pipe <b>101</b> and the lower-side frame pipe <b>102</b> of the vehicle body frame <b>1</b>. The error is, for example, an error in a direction orthogonal to the steering shaft <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, even in the case where the mounting error in mounting the brackets <b>9</b> onto the upper-side frame pipe <b>101</b> is small, the error present between the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> and the brackets <b>9</b> in a direction orthogonal to the steering shaft <b>7</b> is difficult to absorb at the time of supporting the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> by the brackets <b>9</b> in the axial direction of the steering shaft <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> is supported by the left and right brackets <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>. Therefore, the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> can be firmly supported against external forces exerted thereon in the vehicle width direction. However, the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b> is liable to be displaced by an inertial force in the front-rear direction generated in the motor-driven power steering device <b>8</b>, which is a heavy body, in the case where the vehicle is accelerated or decelerated, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a motor-driven power steering unit support structure by which the mounting error in mounting a steering shaft can be absorbed and a motor-driven power steering unit can be supported firmly in the vehicle front-rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the present invention, in a vehicle comprising a steering shaft rotatably supported on a vehicle body frame, a steering bar handle attached to the upper end of the steering shaft, a motor-driven power steering unit attached to the lower end of the steering shaft, and at least two front wheels, the motor-driven power steering unit is supported by the vehicle body frame in the vehicle width direction, and support portions for supporting the motor-driven power steering unit are provided in the vehicle body frame on the front and rear sides, with the steering shaft therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In operation, the motor-driven power steering unit attached to the lower end of the steering shaft extending substantially in the vertical direction is supported in the vehicle width direction substantially orthogonal to the steering shaft. Therefore, the motor-driven power steering unit can be moved in a direction substantially orthogonal to the steering shaft, and it is easy to align the axis of the motor-driven power steering unit to the axis of the steering shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the support portions are provided in the vehicle body frame on the front and rear sides, with the steering shaft therebetween. Therefore, the motor-driven power steering unit which is a heavy body can be firmly supported with good balance on the front and rear side, as compared, for example, with the case where the vehicle body frame is provided with a support portion at one position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect of the present invention, the support portions on the front and rear sides are provided in the same frame member or in a sub unit comprised of at least two frame members and a frame member connecting the at least two frame members to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In operation, with the support portions on the front and rear sides provided in the sub unit, in the present invention, the accuracy of the distance between the support members on the front and rear sides is enhanced, as compared, for example, with the case where support members on the front and rear sides are provided separately in two frame members which are provided at remote positions in a vehicle body frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a third aspect of the present invention, at least one of the support portions on the front and rear sides is located on the vehicle body center side in the frame member or members.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In operation, it is ensured that flying stones, standing trees or the like coming from the outside of the vehicle would not easily collide on the support portions on the front and rear sides. In addition, the motor-driven power steering unit can be protected by the support portions on the front and rear sides.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, unit support portions on the power-driven power steering unit side which correspond to the support portions on the front and rear sides are provided in a power assist portion provided in the motor-driven power steering unit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, the power assist portion is provided with high rigidity in consideration of high torques exerted thereon. Therefore, when the unit support portions are provided in such a high-rigidity power assist portion, it is thereby ensured that the motor-driven power unit is supported more firmly when the unit support portions are attached to the support portions on the front and rear sides.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, an upper bearing portion provided on the vehicle body frame side to support the steering shaft and the support portions on the front and rear sides form a roughly isosceles triangle in side view such that a line segment connecting the support portions on the front and rear sides constitutes the base of the triangle and the upper bearing portion constitutes the vertex of the triangle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In operation, the upper bearing portion and the support portions on the front and rear sides form a roughly isosceles triangle, with the upper bearing portion at the vertex of the triangle, whereby the motor-driven power steering unit is supported stably on the front and rear sides.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the fastening direction of the support portions on the front and rear sides and the fastening direction of the upper bearing portion are set orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, the motor-driven power steering unit is firmly supported against external forces exerted in the fastening directions, as compared with the case where the fastening directions of the support portions on the front and rear sides and the fastening direction of the upper bearing portion are parallel to each other, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, the support portions on the front and rear sides are located in the vicinity of a lower end portion of the motor-driven power steering unit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, the weight of the motor-driven power steering unit and torques generated at the motor-driven power unit can be supported assuredly.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, at least one of the support portions on the front and rear sides is connected to a motor support portion of the motor-driven power steering unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, an electric motor provided in the motor-driven power steering unit is a heavy body and the motor support for supporting such an electric motor is high in rigidity. Therefore, the motor-driven power steering unit can be firmly supported when the high-rigidity motor support portion and the support portions on the front and rear sides are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, in a vehicle comprising a steering shaft rotatably supported on a vehicle body frame, a steering bar handle attached to the upper end of the steering shaft, a motor-driven power steering unit attached to the lower end of the steering shaft, and at least two front wheels, support portions for supporting the motor-driven power steering unit are provided in the vehicle front-rear direction on the vehicle body frame side and are disposed on the front and rear sides of the steering shaft.</p>
