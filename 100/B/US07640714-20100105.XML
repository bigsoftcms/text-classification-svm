<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to packaging for a medical device, and more particularly to packaging and methods for packaging for elongate medical devices including catheters and the like, wherein the orientation for at least a portion of the device is maintained.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of elongated and generally hollow medical devices exist that can be introduced into a patient for many different purposes. For example, elongate medical devices may be used to supply therapeutic fluids, to perform diagnostic or surgical procedures, for implantation of therapeutic devices, and for the introduction of instruments. Exemplary devices include catheters, cannulae, papillotomes, sphincterotomes and the like. The medical devices have a variety of shapes and sizes, and generally include an elongated shaft ranging in length from several inches to several feet long. The diameter of the shaft of the device is usually much smaller than its length. The medical devices typically include one or more lumens extending through most or all of the length of the shaft of the device. One of the lumens may be used for insertion of a wire guide or similar device along the length of the lumen. The medical devices also generally include a distal end which may be shaped or configured as required to carry out the specific procedure for which the device is designed. For example, the distal end may include a complex curvature, adapted to the specific geometry of a target area in the body to facilitate reaching the target location or to facilitate carrying out the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These medical devices are typically packaged for sterilization and shipping. Generally, the packaging provides protection for the medical device and ensures sterility of the device upon delivery to the end user. For example, the elongate shaft of the medical device may be provided in a coiled configuration to make the device more compact for placement in a sterilization pouch and to save room for shipping and storage. These types of packages for sterilization and storage, including packages for coiled configurations, for elongate medical devices are known in the art. However, a previously unrecognized problem arises in the known packaging systems wherein the elongate medical devices become twisted or kinked before or during sterilization or storage, thus rendering these medical devices unusable for the intended medical procedure. In some packaging systems, automated feeding of the elongate medical device into a package prior to sterilization and storage may also cause twisting or kinking of the elongate portion of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During the sterilization process and during storage after manufacture, the overall shape of these medical devices will often change. For example, during the ethylene gas sterilization of the medical devices, portions of these devices, such as the elongate shaft will often increase in length, twist or both, while the distal tip may lose its preformed shape. For medical devices formed from a urethane material, sterilization after manufacture and packaging may include the application of heat. However, the elevated temperature used during sterilization causes the urethane material to relax and twist. The changes in shape and length of the medical devices caused by the sterilization processes, such as ethylene gas and heat, are non-uniform and will vary between each individual medical device. These individual variations due to sterilization cannot be compensated for during the manufacturing process. Some of these changes may make it difficult for the end user to properly use the device. For example, when the lumen the medical device is twisted, insertion or removal of the wire guide may be impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is an improved packaging system and method for elongate medical devices that maintains the orientation of one or more lumens or portions of the elongate shaft by orienting the elongate shaft in the packaging system prior to sterilization and storage to minimizing twisting or kinking of the shaft during sterilization, shipping and storage.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention which have been shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its details are capable of modification in various respects. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the present invention a method of packaging a medical device to orient at least a portion of the medical device is provided. The method includes providing an elongate holder having a lumen extending through at least a portion of the holder and providing a medical device including an elongate shaft, the shaft comprising a first cross-sectional area having a first rotational orientation and a second cross-sectional area having a second rotational orientation. The method includes aligning the first and second cross-sectional areas of the shaft so that the first and second rotational orientations are aligned along a longitudinal region of the shaft and inserting at least a portion of the medical device into the lumen of the holder so that the portion of the medical device inserted into the holder maintains the alignment of the first and second rotational orientations and radial rotation of the first cross-sectional area with respect to the second cross-sectional area is substantially prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the present invention, a method of packaging a medical device to orient at least a portion of the medical device is provided. The method includes providing a holder having a lumen extending therethrough and providing the medical device including an elongate shaft where the shaft includes a splittable wall region along a longitudinal region. The method further includes radially orienting a first area of the splittable wall region with a second area along the longitudinal region; and inserting at least a portion of the shaft into the holder so that the first and second area of the splittable wall region remain substantially radially oriented along the longitudinal region without radial rotation of the splittable wall region in the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the present invention, a medical device packaging assembly is provided. The assembly includes an elongate holder having a lumen where the lumen extends through at least a portion of the holder. The assembly also includes a medical device having an elongate shaft. The shaft includes a first area having first rotational orientation and a second area having a second rotational orientation, at least a portion of the shaft being received in the lumen of the holder so that the rotational orientation of the first area and the rotational orientation of the second area are aligned along a longitudinal region of the shaft without radial rotation of the first area with respect to the second area when the shaft is received in the lumen of the holder.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A medical device packaging assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the assembly <b>10</b> includes a holder <b>12</b> and an elongate medical device <b>14</b>. Exemplary elongate medical devices that may be used with the holder <b>12</b> include, but are not limited to, catheters, cannulas, sphincterotomes, papillotomes or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The holder <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The holder <b>12</b> may be provided in different configurations as will be understood by one skilled in the art, including a planar coil (<b>2</b>A), a helical coil, a hoop, a straight configuration (<b>2</b>B), and the like. The holder <b>12</b> includes a first end <b>22</b> and a second end <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The holder <b>12</b> further includes a lumen <b>26</b> extending through the holder <b>12</b> between the first end <b>22</b> and the second end <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the lumen <b>26</b> may extend partially through the holder <b>12</b>, for example, where the holder <b>12</b> includes a closed first end <b>22</b> or second end <b>26</b> or where the holder <b>12</b> includes an opening <b>28</b> between the first end <b>22</b> and the second end <b>24</b>. The holder <b>26</b> includes a longitudinal axis <b>29</b> and may include a longitudinal region <b>30</b> extending along the holder <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, between the first end <b>22</b> and the second end <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments of the present invention, the longitudinal region may be on the exterior facing portion <b>34</b> of the coiled holder <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. When the holder <b>12</b> is provided in a coiled configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the longitudinal region <b>30</b> is in a single plane <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). In the example of a helical coil, the region <b>30</b> may face outward from the center of the coil. The holder <b>12</b> may be held in a non-linear configuration by clips, adhesive, bonding, such as heat or sonic bonding, and the like. Exemplary clips <b>47</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> where the clips <b>47</b> include recesses to releasably hold the holder <b>12</b> in a coil. A plurality of clips <b>47</b> may be used and spaced apart to hold the holder <b>12</b> in a desired configuration as will be understood by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lumen <b>26</b> of the holder <b>12</b> may be sized and shaped to receive an elongate shaft <b>38</b> of a medical device <b>14</b>, such as the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The dimensions of the holder <b>12</b> will vary depending on the size and configuration of the elongate shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b>. For example, the diameter of the elongate shaft <b>38</b> may range from 1 French to 20 French. A distal end <b>44</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> may include additional elements such as connectors, stylets, mandrels, needles, tubing, wires and the like. Non-limiting, exemplary medical devices that include features such as an elongate shaft include Fusion OMNI E.R.C.P. Catheters and Sphincterotomes (Wilson-Cook, Inc.), GLO-TIP II&#xae; E.R.C.P. Catheters (Wilson-Cook, Inc.), METRO&#xae; Wire Guide (Wilson-Cook, Inc.) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lumen <b>26</b> of the holder <b>12</b> will be sized and shaped to slidably accommodate at least a portion of the shaft <b>38</b> and any additional elements connected to distal end <b>44</b> of the medical device <b>14</b>, which are typically collapsible so as to pass through the lumen <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, the holder <b>12</b> may be provided in a cylindrical configuration having a cylindrical cross-sectional lumen <b>26</b> in a cylindrical cross-sectional tubing forming the holder <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. However, additional configurations for the cross-sectional shape of the lumen and the holder are possible including, but not limited to, oval, square, rectangular, triangular and combinations thereof. An inner diameter <b>46</b> of the lumen <b>26</b> will be sized and shaped for insertion of the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> and will minimize radial twisting movement of the shaft <b>38</b> within the holder <b>14</b>. For example, the lumen <b>26</b> having a cylindrical cross-sectional shape may have an inner diameter <b>46</b> from about 0.030 inches to about 0.300 inches. The outer diameter of the holder <b>12</b> may range from about 0.100 inches to about 0.500 inches in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the ratio of the outer diameter of the shaft <b>38</b> to the holder <b>12</b> may be about 1:1.2 to about 1:4.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The length of the holder <b>12</b> will vary depending on the length of the medical device <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the holder <b>12</b> may extend the entire length of the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> while in other embodiments, the holder <b>12</b> may extend over a partial length of the shaft <b>38</b>. The distal portion <b>44</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> may extend through the lumen <b>26</b> and out through the second end <b>24</b> of the holder <b>12</b>. Additional elements may be added to the distal end <b>44</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> after the shaft <b>38</b> has been inserted into the holder <b>12</b> and the distal end <b>44</b> extends out through the second end of the holder <b>12</b>. For example, where the medical device <b>14</b> is a sphincterotome, a shaping wire (not shown) may be inserted into the distal end <b>44</b> of the shaft <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the second end <b>24</b> of the holder <b>12</b> may be sealed and the distal end <b>44</b> of the elongate medical device <b>14</b> may be enclosed within the holder <b>12</b>. Preferably, the holder <b>12</b> extends over at least 70% of the elongate shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The holder <b>12</b> may be formed from any suitable material for slidably receiving the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b>. The holder <b>12</b> may be formed from plastic materials, such as polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, from metal or metal alloy materials and other suitable materials. An example of a suitable holder may be made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) and purchased from Coeur, Inc., Washington, N.C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the elongate shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> includes a longitudinal region <b>50</b>. The shaft <b>38</b> also includes a first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> having a first rotational orientation and a second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> having a second rotational orientation positioned along the shaft <b>38</b> between a proximal end <b>51</b> and the distal end <b>44</b>. The first and second cross-sectional areas <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> may be located anywhere along the elongate shaft <b>38</b> and are used to illustrate twisting or rotation of the elongate shaft <b>38</b> at a first area A with respect to a second area B, spaced apart form the first area A, elongate shaft <b>38</b>. For example, the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> may be located closer to the proximal end <b>51</b> and the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> may be located closer to the distal end <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The first cross-sectional area, <b>48</b>, the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b>, or both may include a lumen <b>52</b> extending therethrough. A view of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> illustrating the lumen <b>52</b> in the shaft <b>38</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>. In some embodiments, a single lumen, a dual lumen or a plurality of lumens may be included in the shaft <b>38</b>. The lumens may have the same or different sizes and shaped, depending on the purpose of the lumen, including passage of medical devices and fluids to an internal location in the patient. The lumen <b>52</b> may be adapted to receive a wire guide or the like for operation of the medical device <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>38</b> may include a splittable wall region <b>56</b> having the lumen <b>52</b> therein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 6</figref>. The splittable wall region <b>56</b> may have a sufficiently thin region <b>56</b> forming the wall or the region <b>56</b> may be formed a lower durometer material where the region <b>56</b> permits a wire guide <b>58</b> to readily tear or split through the region <b>56</b> as the medical device <b>14</b> is being removed from the patient as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>38</b> may comprise a coextruded shaft material wherein the material surrounding the lumen <b>52</b> is selected or adapted to facilitate splittability for removal of a medical device, such as a wire guide. For example, the coextruded shaft may be formed from a plurality of materials where one of the material has a lower durometer to facilitate splittability. Exemplary coextruded shafts are manufactured by Zeus Industrial Products, Inc. (Orangeburg, S.C.).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, it is desirable to provide the elongate shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> wherein the rotational orientation of area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> may be aligned with the rotational orientation of area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> and the aligned areas A and B of the first and second cross-sectional areas <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> extend along the longitudinal region <b>50</b> of the shaft <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the shaft <b>38</b> extends in a linear configuration and the area A and the area B of the cross-sectional areas <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, respectively are aligned. The alignment of the areas A and B depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is shown in cross sectional views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> and may be maintained when the shaft <b>38</b> is longitudinally coiled into a planar coil configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a twisted shaft <b>38</b> where the shaft <b>38</b> rotates radially about the axis <b>60</b> extending through the shaft <b>38</b>. As shown in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>, the rotational orientation of area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> is radially rotated with respect to the rotational orientation of area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b>. When the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> rotates radially with respect to the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b>, the first and second rotational orientations are not aligned along the longitudinal region <b>50</b> and the shaft <b>38</b> becomes twisted or kinked making it more difficult or impossible for the user to operate the medical device <b>14</b>. For example, when the shaft <b>38</b> includes a splittable wall region <b>56</b> having a wire guide <b>58</b>, the wire guide <b>58</b> may not readily tear through the wall region <b>56</b> if the shaft <b>38</b> is radially twisted around the axis <b>60</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> where the areas A and B are radially rotated with respect to each other. Twisting or kinking of the shaft <b>38</b> may occur during packaging, sterilizing, storage and the like, of the medical device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the packaging assembly <b>10</b> secures the medical device <b>14</b> in the holder <b>12</b> so that the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross sectional area of the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> are oriented along the longitudinal axis <b>60</b>. The packaging assembly <b>10</b> may include an exterior package for packaging, sterilization and storage of the assembly <b>10</b>. Any type of packaging suitable for sterilization and storage may be used with the present invention as will be understood by one skilled in the art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a pouch <b>80</b> may be provided for enclosing the assembly <b>10</b>. The pouch <b>80</b> may be formed from materials suitable for allowing and maintaining sterilization of the assembly <b>10</b> within the pouch <b>80</b>. Any suitable material known to one skilled in the art may be used, including, but not limited to gas permeable, medical grade sheets, such as transparent polymeric sheets. The pouch <b>80</b> may be formed having a backing comprising a paper or TYVEK&#xae; sheet that is secured to the polymeric sheet such as by heat-sealing or bonding. The pouch <b>80</b> may be suitable for sterilization by heat, ethylene oxide, gamma irradiation, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In operation, the holder <b>12</b> may be provided for assembly with the medical device in any configuration. In some embodiments, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the holder <b>12</b> may be provided in a planar, coiled configuration with a plurality of clips <b>47</b> releasably holding the holder <b>12</b> in the coiled configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, both ends <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be open, forming the lumen <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The medical device <b>14</b> is provided for insertion of at least a portion of the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> into the lumen <b>26</b> of the holder <b>12</b>. For insertion into the holder <b>12</b>, the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> are aligned with each other and parallel to the axis <b>60</b> of the shaft <b>38</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, so that the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> will align in the holder <b>12</b> with the shaft <b>38</b> forming a linear coil, substantially preventing axial rotation of the shaft <b>38</b> about the axis <b>60</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>38</b> may be inserted into the holder <b>12</b> so that the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> are aligned with the longitudinal region <b>30</b> of the holder <b>12</b>. The shaft <b>38</b>, the holder <b>12</b>, or both may be provided with markings along the longitudinal region <b>30</b>, at the area A, or at the area B, or combinations thereof, to guide alignment as the shaft <b>38</b> is slidably inserted into the lumen <b>26</b> of the holder <b>12</b>. The area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> or the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> may be used as a guide align the shaft <b>38</b> as the shaft <b>38</b> is slidably received in the holder <b>12</b>. For example, when the shaft <b>38</b> includes a splittable wall region <b>56</b> having the areas A or B or both, the region <b>56</b> may have a different color than the remainder of the shaft <b>38</b>. The colored wall region <b>56</b> may be used to align itself as the distal portion <b>44</b> of the shaft begins to pass the end <b>22</b> of the holder <b>12</b> into the lumen <b>26</b> where the shaft <b>38</b> continues to be inserted shown in <b>8</b>B. For example, if the wall region <b>56</b> is oriented to the exterior <b>34</b> of the holder <b>12</b> with the areas A and B facing outward from a center of the coil <b>62</b>, as the shaft <b>38</b> is inserted into the holder <b>12</b>, the areas A and B may be monitored and oriented to the exterior <b>34</b> as the shaft <b>38</b> is further slidably received in the holder <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The holder <b>12</b> may also include markings along the longitudinal region <b>30</b> that may be colored for visually aligning the shaft <b>38</b> in the holder <b>12</b>. The area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> or the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b>, or both, of the medical device <b>15</b> may include markings that are visible through the holder <b>12</b> when the holder <b>12</b> is formed from a translucent material and the holder need not include markings for alignment. For example, the area A may include a first marking <b>70</b> and the area B may include a second marking <b>72</b> that may be aligned prior to assembling the elongate shaft <b>38</b> into the holder <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. The holder <b>12</b> may also include a third marking <b>74</b> that may be used to align the first marking <b>70</b> the second marking <b>72</b> or both in the holder <b>12</b>. The third marking <b>74</b> on the holder may be a single marking or a longitudinal marking, for example along the longitudinal region <b>30</b>. The markings <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may be single marking or alternatively, the markings <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may extend along the shaft <b>38</b> along the longitudinal region <b>50</b>. The markings <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> need not be used for identifying the position of the elongate shaft <b>38</b> within the body, for example similar to radiopaque markers known in the art. Any markings known to one of skill in the art may be used to guide alignment of the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> of the shaft <b>38</b> with the longitudinal region <b>30</b> of the holder <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> is manually inserted into the lumen <b>26</b> of the holder <b>12</b>. An operator inserting the shaft <b>38</b> orients the area A of the first cross-sectional area <b>48</b> and the area B of the second cross-sectional area <b>49</b> to be parallel to the axis <b>60</b> and removes any radial twisting in the shaft <b>38</b>. The operator monitors the longitudinal orientation of the shaft <b>38</b> as the shaft <b>38</b> is inserted into the holder <b>12</b> to be sure that the orientation is maintained as the shaft <b>38</b> is slidably received in the lumen <b>26</b>. The operator may make adjustments to the orientation of the shaft <b>38</b> as the shaft <b>38</b> is inserted. Alternatively, the shaft <b>38</b> of the medical device <b>14</b> may be automatically inserted into the holder <b>12</b> after being oriented to longitudinally align the longitudinal region <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After insertion of the portion of the shaft <b>38</b> into the holder <b>12</b> has been completed, the assembly <b>10</b> may be packaged into the pouch <b>80</b> for sterilization and storage. Any type of sterilization procedure known to one of skill in the art for sterilizing medical devices may be used. The sterilized assembly <b>10</b> may be stored in the pouch <b>80</b> until use in a medical procedure.</p>
