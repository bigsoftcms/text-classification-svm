<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/844,283 filed Sep. 13, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an adjustable steering column assembly for a vehicle, and more particularly to a central lock device of the adjustable steering column assembly having a roller actuator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known adjustable steering column assemblies can be adjusted in a longitudinal or telescoping direction and in a tilt direction. Generally the longitudinal direction moves a steering wheel forward and rearward with respect to the vehicle and thus farther or closer to the driver. The tilt direction generally moves and tilts the steering in a vertical direction, thus closer or further away from a lap of the driver. To adjust the steering column assembly, the driver must first unlock a lock device before the steering column assembly will move. In some known assemblies, the tilt adjustment and the telescoping adjustment features each have their own lock device. In other known assemblies, a single lock device will release the assembly for both adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, the actuating levers of known lock devices are typically orientated on either the left or right hand sides of the steering column and actuated via a pivoting movement. This orientation and the required pivoting action limit packaging ability of the assembly and can restrict comfort and convenience for the driver. Moreover, known levers are typically mounted to a stationary bracket of the assembly thus do not move with respect to the steering wheel. Thus and in reference to the steering wheel, the position of the lever changes and may not be ideally positioned through the adjustment range of the assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An adjustable steering column assembly of a vehicle has a central lock device for selectably locking an adjustable steering housing and co-extending steering shaft to a stationary bracket or chassis. For driver convenience and comfort, the steering housing and shaft are together adjustable with respect to the bracket. The lock device has a roller actuator preferably having inner and outer members with a lever supported operably in between by a guide feature for movement along a first centerline substantially parallel to the steering shaft. Preferably, cam couplers are located between the outer member and the lever and the inner member and the lever for converting movement of the lever along the centerline to longitudinal movement of a carrier that traverses the centerline.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the carrier operates at least one indexing apparatus supported between the carrier and the housing and/or bracket for longitudinal and/or tilt adjustment of the steering column assembly. The indexing apparatuses move between locked and unlocked positions upon the longitudinal motion of the carrier as a result of the push/pull action of the lever. Each cam coupler may have a rolling pin located in respective resesses of the members for rolling motion against the lever.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Objects, features and advantages of the present invention include an adjustable steering column assembly having a central lock device that enables a central orientation of a push/pull lever of the device. Moreover, because the lever actuates in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the steering column and the roller apparatus generally moves with the steering wheel, versatility in the overall packaging of the assembly is improved and operating convenience for the driver is enhanced.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, an adjustable steering column assembly <b>20</b> for a vehicle has a steering shaft <b>22</b> that projects rearward with respect to the vehicle and along a rotation axis <b>24</b> to a distal end <b>26</b> that attaches to a steering wheel (not shown). The steering shaft <b>22</b> is preferably journaled to and rotates within a tilt housing or steering column <b>28</b>. The housing <b>28</b> is supported by a bracket <b>30</b> of the assembly <b>20</b> that engages rigidly to a chassis of the vehicle via a plurality of pins or threaded studs <b>32</b> that project preferably upward from the bracket <b>30</b> to engage the chassis. The pins <b>32</b> may be constructed and arranged to shear or break away from the chassis should the driver forcibly impact the steering wheel during a vehicle collision.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The housing <b>28</b> and co-extending shaft <b>22</b> are preferably constructed and arranged to extend and retract longitudinally as a single unit and with respect to the bracket <b>30</b> between a retracted position <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an extended position <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When extending, the housing <b>28</b> and shaft <b>22</b> move in a linear rearward direction with respect to the vehicle, and when retracting, the housing <b>28</b> and shaft <b>22</b> move in a forward direction and generally into the bracket <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This forward and rearward movement, however, is not necessarily parallel to rotation axis <b>24</b> of steering shaft <b>22</b> because the housing <b>28</b> and shaft <b>22</b> are preferably constructed and arranged to tilt as a single unit between a rake or tilt down state <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a rake or tilt up state <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This tilt adjustment moves the distal end <b>26</b> of the steering shaft <b>22</b> in an arcuate and substantially vertical direction. To accommodate drivers of small stature, the housing <b>28</b> is generally extended near the extended position <b>36</b> and tilt down state <b>38</b>. To comfortably accommodate drivers of larger stature, the housing <b>28</b> is generally retracted to near the retracted position <b>34</b> and the tilt up state <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the housing <b>28</b> has a substantially tubular portion <b>42</b> that surrounds and rotatably supports the rotating steering shaft <b>22</b>, and a support shuttle portion <b>44</b> that projects downward from the tubular portion <b>42</b>. The shuttle portion <b>44</b> is at least in-part located in the bracket <b>30</b> and is supported operably by the bracket. The shuttle portion <b>44</b> has a cross section that generally forms an upright U-shape having a bottom wall <b>46</b> and two opposite side walls <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> that project upward from the bottom wall <b>46</b> to rigidly connect to the tubular portion <b>42</b>. Correspondingly and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bracket <b>30</b> has a bottom panel <b>52</b> located immediately beneath the bottom wall <b>46</b> of the shuttle portion <b>44</b> and two opposite side panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> projecting upward from the base panel <b>52</b> to preferably engage the vehicle chassis via the pins <b>32</b>. With respect to axis <b>24</b>, the side panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are located immediately outward from the respective side walls <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of the shuttle portion <b>44</b>. Preferably, the side walls <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and side panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> span substantially vertically and are substantially parallel to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A substantially vertical first slot <b>58</b> is located in the first side panel <b>54</b> of the bracket <b>30</b> and a substantially vertical second slot <b>60</b> is located in the second side panel <b>56</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>, both slots <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> enable tilting movement of the housing <b>28</b> between the tilt down and tilt up states <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The second slot <b>60</b> is defined by opposing longitudinal sides <b>61</b>, <b>63</b> carried by the side panel <b>56</b>. Preferably, the first side panel <b>54</b> that defines the first slot <b>58</b> is generally smooth (i.e. is not indexed), and the second side panel <b>56</b> is raked or indexed adjacent to the second slot <b>60</b> at opposing sides <b>61</b>, <b>63</b> for selection of a tilt position. For telescoping or longitudinal movement of the assembly <b>20</b> between the retracted and extended positions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, a substantially horizontal third slot <b>62</b> is in the first side wall <b>48</b> and generally crosses or communicates laterally with the first slot <b>58</b>, and a substantially horizontal fourth slot <b>64</b> is in the second side wall <b>50</b> and generally crosses or communicates laterally with the second slot <b>60</b>. The third slot <b>62</b> is defined by opposing longitudinal sides <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> carried by the side wall <b>48</b>. Preferably, the second side wall <b>50</b> that defines the fourth slot <b>64</b> is generally smooth (i.e. is not indexed), and the first side wall <b>48</b> is indexed adjacent to the third slot <b>62</b> and at sides <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> for selection of a longitudinal or extended/retracted position of the assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the assembly <b>20</b> has a central lock device <b>66</b> that has a first indexing apparatus <b>68</b> for adjusting and locking the longitudinal position of the assembly <b>20</b>, preferably a second indexing apparatus <b>70</b> for adjusting and locking the tilt state of the assembly <b>20</b>, a roller actuator <b>72</b>, and a linking carrier or rod <b>74</b> that operably links both indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> to the common actuator <b>72</b>. The elongated carrier <b>74</b> extends through all four slots <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>60</b> along a first centerline <b>76</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the axis <b>24</b> and preferably spaced below the steering shaft <b>22</b> and tubular portion <b>42</b> of the housing <b>28</b>. The actuator <b>72</b> engages a first end <b>78</b> of the carrier <b>74</b> located outward from the first side panel <b>54</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>. The carrier <b>74</b> generally carries at least in part the first indexing apparatus <b>68</b> at a location between the first and second side walls <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of the shuttle portion <b>44</b>, and an opposite second end <b>80</b> of the carrier <b>74</b> connects and carries at least in part the second indexing apparatus <b>70</b> at a location outward from the second side panel <b>56</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> may be any variety of indexing apparatuses capable of operating with the carrier <b>74</b> that moves along the first centerline <b>76</b> and in a first direction <b>77</b> to place the device <b>66</b> in a locked position <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and in an opposite second direction <b>79</b> to place the device <b>66</b> in an unlocked position <b>84</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). When in the locked position <b>82</b>, the first end <b>78</b> of the carrier <b>74</b> is preferably distant from the first side panel <b>54</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>, and when in the unlocked position <b>84</b>, the first end <b>78</b> is closer to or in the proximity of the first side panel <b>54</b>. One such pair of indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> is taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/726,209 filed Mar. 21, 2007, entitled ROCKER-ARM LOCK DEVICE OF AN ADJUSTABLE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY (U.S. Publication No. 2008-0231030-A1), filed with a common assignee to the present invention and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b> and more specific to the present invention, in the preferred embodiment of the actuator <b>72</b> of the lock device <b>66</b>, the actuator has an elongated lever <b>86</b> that may project in a rearward direction <b>88</b> with respect to the vehicle and toward the driver, and generally along a centerline <b>90</b>. The lever <b>86</b> may be manually actuated in a linear direction along its centerline <b>90</b> that generally remains substantially parallel to axis <b>24</b> regardless of longitudinal positions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and regardless of tilt states <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. As noted above, the actuating levers of known lock devices are typically orientated on either the left or right hand sides of the steering column and actuated via a pivoting movement, which limit packaging ability of the assembly and can restrict comfort and convenience for the driver. The rectilinear motion of lever <b>86</b> along centerline <b>90</b>, however, is nonpivoting lever motion. Because movement and projection of the lever <b>86</b> is substantially parallel to steering axis <b>24</b>, the lever <b>86</b> is generally central to the assembly <b>20</b> as opposed to known levers that project radially with respect to a steering shaft and that generally pivot in an imaginary plane that traverses the steering axis. Manual movement of the lever <b>86</b> from the unlocked position <b>84</b> and toward the locked position <b>82</b> may act against an axial biasing force generally exerted by springs <b>91</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and with respect to centerline <b>76</b> of carrier <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the actuator <b>72</b> diverts or converts motion along the centerline <b>90</b> of the lever <b>86</b> to motion along the intersecting centerline <b>76</b> of the carrier <b>74</b>. To accomplish this, the actuator <b>72</b> has an inner cam member <b>92</b> located and preferably supported slidably by the bracket <b>30</b>, an outer cam member <b>94</b> located adjacent to the end <b>78</b> of the carrier <b>74</b>, first and second cam couplers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> carried between the inner cam member <b>92</b> and the end portion <b>96</b> of lever <b>86</b>, and third and fourth cam couplers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> carried between the outer cam member <b>94</b> and the end portion <b>96</b>. The end <b>78</b> of the carrier <b>74</b> preferably engages threadably a lock nut <b>108</b> that prevents disassembly and maintains proper orientation of the actuator <b>72</b>. From the enlarged head or nut <b>108</b>, the carrier <b>74</b> projects through a bore <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) in the outer cam member <b>94</b> and through a slot <b>110</b> in the end portion <b>96</b> of the lever <b>86</b> that extends longitudinally along the centerline <b>90</b>, and projects through a bore <b>112</b> in the inner member <b>92</b> before projecting through the slots <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>60</b> in the bracket <b>30</b> and housing <b>28</b> as previously described. The carrier or rod <b>74</b> slides axially through the bore <b>112</b> in the inner cam member <b>92</b> as the carrier <b>74</b> moves along centerline <b>76</b> between the locked and unlocked positions <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. The close relationship between the inner cam member <b>92</b> and the sliding carrier or rod <b>74</b> acts generally as a bushing to prevent misalignment of the device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the inner and outer cam members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are identical for reducing manufacturing costs and simplifying assembly. Both members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> have a planar base portion or plate <b>114</b> disposed substantially perpendicular to centerline <b>76</b>. The base portion <b>114</b> of the inner member <b>92</b> generally supports in-part two guide features <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> for multi-directional movement of the actuator <b>72</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, guide feature or guide track <b>116</b> prevents the inner cam member <b>92</b> from moving forward or rearward (i.e. horizontally) with respect to the bracket <b>30</b> while preferably guiding the actuator <b>72</b> vertically during tilt adjustment of the steering column assembly <b>20</b>. The guide track <b>116</b> is carried between an inner side of the base portion <b>114</b> of the inner member <b>92</b> and the bracket <b>30</b> at the slot <b>58</b>. Preferably, the guide track <b>116</b> has first and second ribs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> that project contiguously outward from the inner surface of the base portion <b>114</b>. The first rib <b>120</b> projects laterally into the slot <b>58</b> in the panel <b>54</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>, and the second rib <b>122</b> projects laterally in front of and against a rearward facing edge <b>124</b> of the panel <b>54</b> for restrained sliding movement. The guide track <b>116</b> generally prevents or restricts movement of the inner member <b>92</b> when the assembly <b>20</b> is moving between longitudinal positions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and enables guided vertical movement of the roller actuator <b>72</b> when the assembly <b>20</b> is moving between tilt states <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and because members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are preferably identical, outer member <b>94</b> also has ribs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. However, ribs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> of member <b>94</b> are not part of feature <b>116</b> and thus do not perform a function. One skilled in the art would now realize that members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> may not be identical. If not identical, outer member <b>94</b> may be manufactured without ribs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Furthermore, the bore <b>112</b> of outer member <b>94</b> could be threaded for a locking engagement to the threaded end <b>78</b> of carrier <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, guide feature <b>118</b> maintains substantial linear movement of the lever <b>86</b> along centerline <b>90</b> while permitting slight lateral movement of the lever <b>86</b> away from inner member <b>92</b> and along centerline <b>76</b> when locking the device <b>66</b>. For sliding contact with opposite longitudinal edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of end portion <b>96</b> of lever <b>86</b>, feature <b>118</b> has first and second projections <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> projecting outward from the base portion <b>114</b> of each member <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>. With respect to base portion <b>114</b> the projections <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are preferably kitty-corner to one another and project axially with respect to centerline <b>76</b> and in a direction opposite to the lateral projections of the ribs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> attached to the respective members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For structural support and respective sliding contact with the axial projections <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> of one member, the feature <b>118</b> has respective first and second stanchions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> projecting radially outward in substantially opposite directions from the base portion <b>114</b> of the other member (with respect to centerline <b>76</b>). When assembled, the projection <b>130</b> contiguous to inner member <b>92</b> is in sliding contact with stanchion <b>134</b> contiguous to outer member <b>94</b>, and the projection <b>132</b> contiguous to inner member <b>92</b> is in sliding contact with stanchion <b>136</b> contiguous to outer member <b>94</b>. Similarly, the projection <b>130</b> contiguous to outer member <b>94</b> is in sliding contact with stanchion <b>134</b> contiguous to inner member <b>92</b>, and the projection <b>132</b> contiguous to outer member <b>94</b> is in sliding contact with stanchion <b>136</b> contiguous to inner member <b>92</b>. The projections <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> and stanchions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> of the guide feature <b>118</b> enable sliding of the outer member <b>94</b> along the centerline <b>76</b> and with respect to lever <b>86</b>, while simultaneously enabling lateral sliding of the lever <b>86</b> along the centerline <b>76</b> with respect to member <b>92</b> and as the device <b>66</b> moves between the locked and unlocked positions <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For an even or symmetric distribution of camming forces during actuation of device <b>66</b>, the inward cam couplers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are generally positioned diametrically opposite with respect to one another (i.e. positioned one-hundred and eighty degrees apart from one-another) and with respect to the carrier centerline <b>76</b>. Preferably, coupler <b>100</b> is generally located radially outward from the carrier <b>74</b> and radially inward from feature <b>118</b>. Likewise, coupler <b>102</b> is generally located radially outward from the carrier <b>74</b> and radially inward from feature <b>118</b>. Couplers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are diametrically positioned with respect to one another (i.e. positioned one-hundred and eighty degrees apart from one-another) and with respect to the carrier centerline <b>76</b>. Preferably, coupler <b>104</b> is generally located radially outward from the carrier <b>74</b> and radially inward from feature <b>118</b>. Likewise, coupler <b>106</b> is generally located radially outward from the carrier <b>74</b> and radially inward from feature <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The end portion <b>96</b> of lever <b>86</b> is preferably a flat bar and carries an inward side <b>146</b> being of both couplers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, and an outward side <b>148</b> being of both couplers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The opposite sides <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> flank the edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of the end portion <b>96</b>, and the slot <b>110</b> communicates through both sides <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>. Generally, the inward side <b>146</b> faces the inward member <b>92</b> and the outward side <b>148</b> faces the outward member <b>94</b>. The edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and the sides <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> are substantially parallel to one-another and to the centerline <b>90</b>. Each coupler <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> has a roller or preferably a rolling pin <b>150</b> disposed substantially in respective tapered recesses <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of both members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>. Each recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> is defined in-part by a bottom surface <b>156</b> carried by the base portion <b>114</b> and each lying in respective imaginary planes that intersect both centerline <b>76</b> and centerline <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each bottom surface <b>156</b> spans between substantially vertical and opposing faces <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> that define in-part each recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. With respect to the vehicle, face <b>158</b> faces forward and defines a rearward end of the recess, and face <b>160</b> faces rearward and defines a forward end of the recess. The forward face <b>158</b> is preferably wider than the rearward face <b>160</b> due to the tapering effect of the bottom surface <b>156</b> and by an amount generally equal to half the throw of the carrier <b>74</b> as it moves between locked and unlocked positions <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. Preferably, the width of forward face <b>158</b> is substantially equal to the diameter of the rolling pin <b>150</b>. Generally, each recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> gets deeper in the forward direction with respect to the vehicle. Preferably, the bottom surface <b>156</b> of the first coupler <b>100</b> is parallel to the bottom surface <b>156</b> of the second coupler <b>102</b>. Similarly, the bottom surface <b>156</b> of the third coupler <b>104</b> is parallel to the bottom surface <b>156</b> of the fourth coupler <b>106</b>. The imaginary planes of the bottom surfaces <b>156</b> of the first and second couplers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> intersect the imaginary planes of the bottom surfaces <b>156</b> of the third and fourth couplers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> along intersecting lines (not shown) that are generally parallel to rolling axes <b>163</b> of each rolling pin <b>150</b>. The rolling axes <b>163</b> are substantially perpendicular to centerlines <b>76</b>, <b>90</b> and parallel to respective surfaces <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As previously described and in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the springs <b>91</b> of the indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> are orientated to bias the locking device <b>66</b> toward the unlocked position <b>84</b>. To resist this biasing force when the device <b>66</b> is in the locked position <b>82</b>, the end portion <b>96</b> of the lever <b>86</b> preferably carries a detent or cantilevered tab <b>164</b> that resiliently projects flexibly into the slot <b>110</b> near a forward facing stop face <b>166</b> that generally defines a rearward end of the slot <b>110</b> with respect to the vehicle. Similarly, the end portion <b>96</b> may also have a second detent or cantilevered tab <b>168</b> located near a rearward facing stop face <b>170</b> that generally defines a forward end of the slot <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As previously described in-part and best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, one rolling pin <b>150</b> is located in each recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> in each member <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> for reducing friction between the lever sides <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and the bottom surfaces <b>156</b> of the respective members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, and for generally restricting and diverting motion along the centerline <b>90</b> to motion along the centerline <b>76</b>. When the actuator <b>72</b> is in the locked position <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the rolling pins <b>150</b> are at the forward end of each respective recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> and near or against the rearward face <b>160</b>, and the carrier <b>74</b> is snap fitted directly between the flexible lock tab <b>164</b> and stop face <b>166</b> of the lever <b>86</b>. When the actuator <b>72</b> is in the unlocked position <b>84</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the rolling pins <b>150</b> are at the rearward end of each respective recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of each member <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> and near or against the forward face <b>158</b>, and the carrier <b>74</b> (in addition to the biasing spring force) may be snap fitted directly between the flexible tab <b>162</b> and near or against the stop face <b>170</b> of the lever <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">During operation of the lock device <b>66</b>, the indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> are simultaneously placed in the unlocked position <b>84</b> (as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) when the driver desires to longitudinally and/or tiltably adjust the steering housing <b>28</b>. The lock device <b>66</b> is placed in the locked position <b>82</b> (as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) after the driver has selected a desirable longitudinal position and tilt state for the steering wheel. In order to move the device <b>66</b> between the unlocked and locked positions <b>84</b>, <b>82</b>, the driver respectively pulls and preferably pushes upon the lever <b>86</b> of the actuator <b>72</b> in a linear direction or along centerline <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the lever <b>86</b> of the roller pin actuator <b>72</b> of the lock device <b>66</b> is pulled by the driver to unlock (i.e. rearward toward the driver), the outward cam member <b>94</b> moves along centerline <b>76</b> and toward the side <b>148</b> of the lever <b>86</b>. With continued pulling of the lever <b>86</b> and with the biasing assistance of the springs <b>91</b> of the respective indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, the device <b>66</b> is preferably placed in the unlocked position <b>84</b> generally designated when the carrier <b>74</b> snap fits past the flexible tab <b>162</b> and abuts the stop face <b>170</b> of the lever <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During this pulling action, the rolling pins <b>150</b> generally roll about respective axes <b>163</b> and from the rearward face <b>160</b> and toward the wider forward face <b>158</b> defining each recess <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of each member <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>. The throw of the lever <b>86</b> along centerline <b>90</b> and the shifting of the rolling pins <b>150</b> in the recesses <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> cause the outer member <b>94</b> with the carrier <b>74</b> to move along the centerline <b>76</b> by a throw, which is great enough to release the indexing apparatuses <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. This throw is substantially equal to the difference of the widths between the forward and rearward faces <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the desired longitudinal position and tilt state of the assembly <b>20</b> is selected, the lever <b>86</b> of the actuator <b>72</b> is pushed by the driver to lock (i.e. forward and away from the driver) and against the biasing force of the springs <b>91</b> and resistance of the tab <b>162</b>. Continued pushing in the forward direction with respect to the vehicle causes an opposite motion of the rollers as previously explained when unlocking. This action moves the members <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> away from one another and away from respective inner and outer sides <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> of the lever <b>86</b> and until the carrier <b>74</b> snap locks past the resilient tab <b>164</b> and abuts the stop face <b>166</b>. Once in the locked position <b>82</b>, the tab <b>164</b> resists the biasing force of the springs <b>91</b>, thus maintaining the device <b>66</b> in the locked state.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, a second embodiment of a central lock device <b>266</b> is illustrated wherein like elements to the first embodiment have the same identifying numerals except with the summed addition of two hundred. Unlike device <b>66</b>, device <b>266</b> does not have an outer member, and thus has only two couplings <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> and not four. For lock device <b>266</b>, a threaded nut or enlarged head <b>308</b> engages a threaded end <b>278</b> of a carrier <b>274</b>. The nut <b>308</b> slides directly against an outer surface <b>348</b> of a lever <b>286</b> as the device moves between unlocked and locked positions <b>284</b>, <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a third embodiment of a central lock device <b>366</b> is illustrated wherein like elements to the first embodiment have the same identifying numerals except with the summed addition of three hundred. Unlike devices <b>66</b>, <b>266</b> that are generally manual, device <b>366</b> has a reversible electric motor <b>180</b> with a motor housing engaged rigidly to a steering column housing (not shown) of the vehicle. The motor <b>180</b> has a rotating shaft or turn buckle <b>182</b> that extends substantially parallel to a steering column or a rotation axis of a steering shaft (not shown). A lever <b>386</b> of the device <b>366</b> is threaded to the shaft <b>182</b> forming a screw drive arrangement for movement of the lever <b>286</b> between locked and unlocked positions along a centerline or direction <b>390</b> causing an actuator <b>372</b> to move a carrier <b>374</b> along a centerline <b>376</b> that is substantially perpendicular to centerline <b>390</b>.</p>
