<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a motorcycle having a rear swing arm provided on a rear part of a body of the motorcycle for supporting a rear wheel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A configuration of a motorcycle in which a rear swing arm is provided to a rear part of a motorcycle body is disclosed, e.g., in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-87364 (JP 2002-87364 A). The relationship between the rear swing arm and a brake caliper as disclosed in the above document will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</figref> hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, a rear swing arm <b>103</b> is attached to a motorcycle body frame <b>101</b> via a pivot shaft <b>102</b>. A rear wheel <b>104</b> is rotatably attached to a rear end of the rear swing arm <b>103</b>. A brake disc <b>105</b> is integrally attached to the rear wheel <b>104</b>. A caliper <b>106</b> is provided to a rear portion of the rear swing arm <b>103</b>. The caliper <b>106</b> clamps the brake disc <b>105</b> and performs a braking function.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the rear wheel <b>104</b> is not subjected to an upward force from a road surface, the rear swing arm <b>103</b> will extend downward at a slant from the pivot shaft <b>102</b>. An angle &#x3b2;a is formed by a line Vc, which passes through a center of a rear wheel axle <b>107</b> and the caliper <b>106</b>, and a line VL, which is plumb with the road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, when upward force from the road surface acts on the rear wheel <b>104</b>, the rear wheel <b>104</b> will be raised a distance Sb from the initial position, and the rear swing arm <b>103</b> will extend from the pivot shaft <b>102</b> so as to be substantially parallel to the road surface. An angle &#x3b2;b formed by the line Vc and the line VL is greater than the angle &#x3b2;a.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, when considerable upward force from the road surface acts on the rear wheel <b>104</b>, the rear wheel <b>104</b> will be raised a distance Sc from the initial position, and the rear swing arm <b>103</b> will extend upward at a slant from the pivot shaft <b>102</b>. An angle &#x3b2;c formed by the line Vc and the line VL is greater than the angle &#x3b2;b.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">During braking, the rear swing arm <b>103</b> is subjected to braking force from the caliper <b>106</b>. When the total of the braking force and the force received from the road surface acts on the rear swing arm <b>103</b>, torsion and flexing occur in the rear swing arm <b>103</b> according to the total force.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The changing of the orientation of the caliper <b>106</b> relative to the road surface as indicated by the angles &#x3b2;a, &#x3b2;b, &#x3b2;c causes deformation to occur in the rear swing arm <b>103</b>. This deformation may vary slightly from the predicted deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result, the contact between the caliper <b>106</b> and the brake disc <b>105</b> (degree of contact) varies, and an abnormal noise known as &#x201c;brake squeal&#x201d; may occur. A need exists for a technique that can resolve these defects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, there is provided a motorcycle comprising: a body frame; an engine carried on the body frame; a rear swing arm extending from one of the body frame and the engine; a rear wheel supported by the rear swing arm; and a drive mechanism for transmitting a drive force from the engine to the rear wheel. The rear swing arm comprises: upper arms and lower arms vertically swingably attached to one of the body frame and the engine via pivot shafts, the upper arms and lower arms extending toward the rear wheel and being parallel and in vertically spaced relation to each other; and an arm body swingably connected to a rear end of the upper and lower arms via support shafts for supporting the rear wheel, the arm body being in the form of a U shape as viewed in top plan and surrounding a front portion of the rear wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The arm body that supports the rear wheel is connected to the motorcycle body frame or the engine via the upper arm and lower arm. The upper arm and lower arm are disposed in parallel to one another. Therefore, the arm body moves vertically in parallel to a line that is plumb with the road surface. The orientation of the caliper does not change because the caliper is provided to the arm body. As a result, the occurrence of brake squeal and other defects can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the drive mechanism has a drive shaft for transmitting a drive force to the rear wheel, and a reduction gear unit with a reduction gear case for covering the reduction gear unit. The gear case has an edge part attached to the arm body by a plurality of fastening member that extend in a width direction of the motorcycle. The reduction gear case is directly attached to the arm body. Force applied to the reduction gear case can be supported by the arm body. Specifically, the arm body performs a function for reinforcing the reduction gear case. As a result, the thickness and weight of the reduction gear case can be reduced, and the weight of the reduction gear unit can also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Desirably, the arm body has an upper frame part and a lower frame part provided in vertically spaced relation to each other, while the reduction gear unit is disposed between the upper frame part and the lower frame part.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Placing the reduction gear unit between the upper and lower frame parts allows the reduction gear unit to be provided within the arm body. Even if the reduction gear unit protrudes from the arm body, as seen from above, the degree to which the unit protrudes can be reduced, the motorcycle can be prevented from being made wider, and the motorcycle can be made more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The reduction gear case acts as a bridge for connecting the upper frame part and the lower frame part, and performs a reinforcement function whereby the upper frame part and the lower frame part are prevented from getting further apart, or coming closer to each other.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Specifically, the motorcycle body frame <b>11</b> and the front wheel <b>16</b> are connected by four arms; i.e., the upper arms <b>13</b>L, <b>13</b>R (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the lower arms <b>15</b>L, <b>15</b>R (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Accordingly, a space can be maintained in front of the engine <b>26</b>. Ensuring that this space is present allows the components to be disposed with a greater degree of latitude. For example, the upper and lower radiators <b>55</b>T, <b>55</b>B can be disposed in this space. The two radiators <b>55</b>T, <b>55</b>B enable adequately robust cooling performance to be demonstrated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, the engine <b>26</b> is a V-type engine <b>26</b> in which cylinders are disposed in a V-shape. However, the engine <b>26</b> may also be an in-line engine <b>26</b> in which cylinders are disposed in a row. The engine <b>26</b> is in a so-called transverse layout in which a crankshaft is disposed in a width direction of the motorcycle. However, the engine <b>26</b> may also have a so-called vertical layout in which the crankshaft is disposed in the longitudinal direction of the motorcycle. The engine <b>26</b> is not limited to being cooled by water, and may also be cooled by air. In other words, the type and layout of the engine <b>26</b> are not limited to the embodiments, and can be configured as required.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A front cushioning unit <b>61</b> for absorbing force is provided to the front cushioning mechanism <b>25</b>. The exhaust pipe <b>45</b> through which exhaust gas of the engine <b>26</b> passes is disposed externally with respect to the front cushioning unit <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The exhaust pipe <b>45</b> through which exhaust gas of the engine <b>26</b> passes is disposed externally with respect to, or in front of, the front cushioning unit <b>61</b>. The exhaust pipe <b>45</b> also serves to protect the expensive front cushioning unit <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The structure of the front part <b>10</b>R of the motorcycle <b>10</b> will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a rear swing arm <b>30</b> provided to the rear part of the motorcycle has upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R and lower arms <b>34</b>L, <b>34</b>R that extend toward the rear wheel <b>39</b> and that are disposed in parallel to each other so as to be vertically separated. The swing arm also has the arm body <b>37</b> that is swingably connected to the rear ends of the upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R and the rear ends of the lower arms <b>34</b>L, <b>34</b>R via support shafts <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>L, <b>36</b>R (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), that has a U shape as viewed from above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) so as to surround a front half portion of the rear wheel <b>39</b>, and that supports the rear wheel <b>39</b>. A rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> for absorbing force that is applied to the arm body <b>37</b> is provided between the upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R and the lower arms <b>34</b>L, <b>34</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R are disposed to the left and right of the motorcycle, are connected at the rear ends, and form a substantial V shape, as seen when the motorcycle is viewed from above. The relative position of the upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R can be freely changed by changing the angle of the V shape. For example, the configuration formed by the upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R can be set according to the width of the seat <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As seen when the motorcycle <b>10</b> is viewed from above, the lower arms <b>34</b>L, <b>34</b>R are disposed in parallel to the left and the right of the motorcycle <b>10</b>, and are connected by a substantially X-shaped cross part <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Providing the cross part <b>63</b> makes it possible to increase the rigidity of the lower arm <b>34</b>L and the lower arm <b>34</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the arm body <b>37</b> forms a substantial U shape that opens toward the rear, as seen when the motorcycle <b>10</b> is viewed from above. Force from the left and right can be absorbed in a balanced manner, and deformation in the arm body <b>37</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An upper end part <b>65</b><i>t </i>of a rod member <b>65</b> is connected to a connection point <b>69</b> of the upper arms <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R, which form a substantial V-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, the connection point <b>69</b> is located in the center along the width direction of the motorcycle, a stay <b>68</b> is provided to the connection point <b>69</b>, and the upper end part <b>65</b><i>t </i>of the rod member <b>65</b> is connected to the stay <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, force transmitted from the rear wheel <b>39</b> to the arm body <b>37</b> is concentrated in the center of the motorcycle, and is transmitted to the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> via the stay <b>68</b> and the rod member <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a constant-velocity joint <b>81</b>, the drive shaft <b>42</b> that extends from the constant-velocity joint <b>81</b>, and a reduction gear unit <b>72</b> that is connected to the drive shaft <b>42</b> are included in a drive mechanism <b>71</b> for driving the rear wheel <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An upper arm <b>74</b> and a lower arm <b>75</b> are disposed on the rear part <b>37</b><i>r </i>of the arm body <b>37</b> set apart in the vertical direction, and the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> is disposed between the upper arm <b>74</b> and the lower arm <b>75</b>. The reduction gear unit <b>72</b> is covered by a reduction gear case <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An edge part <b>76</b><i>f </i>of the reduction gear case <b>76</b> is fastened to the arm body <b>37</b> by a plurality of fastening members <b>78</b> extending along the width direction of the motorcycle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Force that is applied to the reduction gear case <b>76</b> can be directly transmitted to the arm body <b>37</b> because the edge part <b>76</b><i>f </i>of the reduction gear case <b>76</b> that covers the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> is fastened to the arm body <b>37</b> via the fastening members <b>78</b>. Since the reduction gear case <b>76</b> is directly fastened to the arm body <b>37</b>, the arm body <b>37</b> acts to reinforce the reduction gear case <b>76</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the necessary rigidity of the reduction gear case <b>76</b>. Reducing the rigidity of the reduction gear case <b>76</b> makes it possible to reduce the thickness of the reduction gear case <b>76</b>. The weight of the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> can therefore be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> does not need to protrude from the arm body <b>37</b> because the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> is disposed between the upper arm <b>74</b> and the lower arm <b>75</b>. As a result, the reduction gear unit <b>72</b> is disposed within the arm body <b>37</b>, as seen when the motorcycle <b>10</b> is viewed from above, and it is possible to prevent an increase in the width of the motorcycle <b>10</b>. Therefore, it is possible to make the motorcycle <b>10</b> more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The action of the structure of the rear parts of the motorcycle <b>10</b> described above will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the rear wheel <b>39</b> is not being subjected to force from the road surface, the arm members <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> extend downward and to the right from the pivot shafts <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. An angle is formed by a line V that is plumb with the road surface, and a line Vc that extends from the rear wheel axle <b>38</b> and passes through the center of the rear wheel disc caliper <b>53</b>. This angle is designated as &#x3b8;a.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the rear part cushioning mechanism <b>41</b> has a rear cushioning bracket <b>64</b> and a support shaft <b>60</b> that are provided to the motorcycle body frame; a substantially L-shaped rear link <b>67</b> that is swingably provided to the support shaft <b>60</b>; and the lower part cushioning unit <b>62</b>, which extends from a middle portion <b>67</b><i>m </i>of the rear link <b>67</b> and which is connected to the rear cushioning bracket <b>64</b>. Specifically, a first end <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> is attached to the middle portion <b>67</b><i>m </i>of the rear link <b>67</b>, and a second end <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> is attached to the rear cushioning bracket <b>64</b>. A second end <b>67</b><i>b </i>that constitutes the base of the rear link <b>67</b> is attached to the support shaft <b>60</b>; and a first end <b>67</b><i>a </i>that constitutes a distal end of the rear link <b>67</b> is attached to the rod member <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, force is not being applied to the rod member <b>65</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. As a result, the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> is not compressed and is in an extended state.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, when the rear wheel <b>39</b> is subjected to force from the road surface, the rear wheel <b>39</b> will be raised a distance of Sb from the original position, upward force will be applied to the arm body <b>37</b>, and the arm members <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> will rotate around the pivot shafts <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> in the counterclockwise direction relative to the plane of the drawing. In this case, force is applied to the rod member <b>65</b> in the direction of the arrow s. The angle formed by the line VL and the line VC is designated as &#x3b8;b.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since the arm members <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> are parallel, the arm body <b>37</b> moves in the vertical direction without changing or substantially changing its orientation due to a so-called parallel link effect. Specifically &#x3b8;a=&#x3b8;b, or &#x3b8;a&#x2248;&#x3b8;b. Accordingly, the orientation of the rear wheel disc caliper <b>53</b> does not change with respect to the road surface. Since the orientation does not change, brake squeal can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, in this case, force is applied to the rod member <b>65</b> in the direction of the arrow s, and force that urges the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> to retract in the direction of the arrow t is applied to the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> via the rear link <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A modification will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">First, the manner in which the layout of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> can be freely modified will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a concave part <b>82</b> that opens toward the rear is provided to a rear part of a vehicle frame <b>11</b>C. The rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> is housed in the concave part <b>82</b>. The length of the rod member <b>65</b> must be modified, and the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> can be positioned further forward than the upper and lower pivot shafts <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. It is also possible to shorten the upper arm <b>33</b>L and the lower arm <b>34</b>L without changing the position of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b>. A space can thus be provided between the upper arm <b>33</b>L and the lower arm <b>34</b>L. The rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> can therefore be freely positioned forward or rearward of the pivot shafts <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. A space able to accommodate a rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> of a size that corresponds to the necessary stroke is readily maintained between the motorcycle frame <b>11</b>C and the arm body <b>37</b>, and the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> can be disposed in this space.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A structure that differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is presented below. This structure will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with a major point of difference relative to the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> being that two left and right rear links are provided, and two left and right rod members are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the rod member <b>65</b> has a left rod member <b>65</b>L and a right rod member <b>65</b>R. The rear link <b>67</b> has a left rear link <b>67</b>L and a right rear link <b>67</b>R. The left rod member <b>65</b>L is connected to the first end <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> via the left rear link <b>67</b>L. The right rod member <b>65</b>R is connected to the second end <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> via the right rear link <b>67</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The left and right rod members <b>65</b>L, <b>65</b>R are subjected to force that is transmitted by the arm parts <b>33</b>L, <b>33</b>R. The left and right rod members <b>65</b>L, <b>65</b>R then transmit force to the first and second ends <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b>. Specifically, force is distributed to the left and right and is transmitted to the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b>. Accordingly, force applied to the rear wheel <b>39</b> can be transmitted to and absorbed by the rear part cushioning unit <b>62</b> in a properly balanced manner.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A structure that differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is presented below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the main frame is omitted, and the upper arm <b>13</b>L and the lower arm <b>15</b>L are directly connected a front part of the engine <b>26</b>. The arm members <b>33</b>L, <b>34</b>L are directly connected to a rear part of the engine <b>26</b>. Providing the engine <b>26</b> with a main frame function allows the weight of the motorcycle <b>10</b> to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Obviously, various minor changes and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teaching. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
