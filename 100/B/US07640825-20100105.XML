<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A tension compensation assembly for a mechanical control cable. The tension compensation device has a housing with opposing ends. First and second sections of the control cable pass through but are attached at each end of the housing such that the sheaths of each section are coupled to the housing and reciprocable cable coaxially disposed in each control cable section extend into the housing. The cables are attached to opposing ends of a reciprocably disposed capsule or spring caps generally enclosing a spring. In operation, the capsule moves slidably within the housing over a predetermined travel and tension for the cables. However, if an over-tension condition is experienced, the capsule may bottom out at an end of the housing and the spring will either compress or extend, depending upon its design, thus allowing the effective length of the control cable assembly to increase, thus preventing the stretching or breaking of the cables or damage to cable end fittings.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a tension compensation device, particularly to an apparatus for preventing stretching and/or breakage of control cables and their end fittings during use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A control cable typically comprises a flexible outer sheath encasing a multi-strand cable capable of free coaxial movement within the sheath. The control cable is installed such that the sheath is captively engaged at both ends and the inner cable is reciprocally movable within the fixed sheath. Control cables are commonly used to actuate remotely located latched devices in a vehicle and elsewhere. Examples of latched device applications include hood releases, fuel door releases, trunk releases, as well as passenger seat releases. In a typical configuration, a first end of a cable is connected to a release lever or other control mechanism accessible to an occupant of a vehicle. A second end of the inner cable is typically connected to a release mechanism of the latched device which, when engaged, maintains the device in a closed or latched position. To manually release the latched device, an operator actuates the suitable release lever, causing the cable to tense within the control cable assembly. Once the tension on the control cable exceeds the force of the latching device, it unlatches.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A particular problem with the use of control cables to release latched devices is the potential for over-travel, or over-tensioning, of the cable components. Over-travel may occur when an operator actuates the release lever and/or the latched device beyond their intended travel limits. This can cause excessive tension on the cables, which can lead to their stretching or breaking as well as causing damage to any end fittings attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for a modification for a mechanical control cable assembly that is capable of being actuated through a normal range of movement and tension without restriction, yet prevents the cable components from being stretched or broken due to over-travel by an associated control mechanism or latch.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A tension compensated control cable assembly is disclosed according to the present invention. The tension compensation portion includes a housing with opposing ends. First and second sheathed control cable sections pass through at each end of the housing such that the sheath of each section is captively retained by the housing at each end. Reciprocable cables, coaxially disposed within each control cable section extends into the housing through their respective sheathes. A first cable within the first sheathed control cable passes longitudinally through a first end of a capsule that is reciprocably disposed within the housing. The first cable further passes longitudinally through a compression spring and is coupled to a spring cap. The spring is captively retained between the first end of the capsule and the spring cap and is compressible within the capsule. A second cable within the second control cable passes through a second end of the housing and a second end of the capsule, where it is captively retained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In operation, one embodiment of the invention operates such that the compression spring remains in open-coil condition when in its unloaded state. The first and second control cable sections are each attached to one of a latched device and a control mechanism, such as a mechanical lever, which can be either manually or machine operated. Applying tension on one of the cable sections with the control mechanism results in longitudinal reciprocating movement of the capsule within the housing, causing axial movement of the opposing cable, thereby actuating and releasing the latched device. Thus, the first and second control cable sections cooperate to function as a conventional, unitary control cable when operated within the design limits of a particular latch and cable release application. However, in the event of an over-travel or over-tensioned condition, such that the tension on the cable exceeds a predetermined amount, the spring will compress as the spring cap is drawn toward the first end of the capsule, increasing the effective length of the control cable assembly and thus limiting the tension on its components until a mechanical stop of either the release lever or actuated device is reached. As a result, the risk of stretching or breaking of the control cable components and/or damage to their end fittings is greatly lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device comprises a first control cable section having an outer sheath and a reciprocable inner cable and a second control cable section having an outer sheath and a reciprocable inner cable, and a coil spring having first and second opposing ends, the first spring end being coupled to an end of the cable of the first control cable section and the second spring end being coupled to an end of the cable of the second control cable section. A free end of the first control cable section is coupled to a control mechanism and a free end of the second control cable section is coupled to a remote latched device such that the control cable assembly is effective to release the latched device upon actuation of the control mechanism. However, since the coils of the spring deform when the tension of the first and second cables exceeds a predetermined load, this reduces the risk of damage to the control cable assembly in the event of an over-travel condition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The tension compensator comprises a housing having first and second opposing ends. A capsule having first and second opposing ends is reciprocably disposed within the housing, the capsule including a spring cap slidably disposed within the capsule and a compression spring captively retained between the spring cap and the first end of the capsule. A first control cable section comprises a first longitudinal, hollow sheath coupled to the first end of the housing, and a first cable reciprocally disposed within the first sheath, extending through the first end of the housing, the first end of the capsule and the spring, the end of the cable being coupled to the spring cap. A second control cable section comprises a second longitudinal, hollow sheath passing through but captively retained by the second end of the housing, and a second cable reciprocally disposed within the second sheath, extending through the second end of the housing and being coupled to the second end of the capsule. A free end of the first control cable section is coupled to a control mechanism for exerting tension on the control cable assembly and a free end of the second control cable section is coupled to a latched device such that the actuation of the control mechanism is effective to release the latched device. However, since the spring compresses when the tension of the first and second cable wires exceeds a predetermined amount, this reduces the risk of damage to the control cable assembly in the event of an over-travel condition.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the discussion that follows, like numerals will be used to describe features having similar structure and/or function.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A control cable assembly <b>10</b> having a tension compensation assembly <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Tension compensation assembly <b>11</b> is interposed between a first control cable section <b>12</b> and a second control cable section <b>14</b>. Tension compensation assembly <b>11</b> includes a housing <b>16</b>, which may be one of a variety of shapes, such as generally cylindrical. First control cable section <b>12</b> engages housing <b>16</b> at a first end <b>18</b>. Likewise, second control cable section <b>14</b> engages housing <b>16</b> at a second, opposing end <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">First control cable section <b>12</b> includes a first sheath <b>22</b> and a first (inner) cable <b>24</b>, the cable wire being disposed coaxially within the first sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. First sheath <b>22</b> is coupled to first end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b>, while first cable <b>24</b> passes into housing <b>16</b> through first end <b>18</b> and into a first end <b>26</b> of a capsule <b>28</b>. Sheathed cable sections pass through first and second ends of the housing and are captively retained using conventional means. Capsule <b>28</b> is reciprocable within housing <b>16</b>. First cable <b>24</b> passes generally coaxially through the longitudinal axis of a compression-type open-coil spring <b>30</b> disposed within capsule <b>28</b>, and then through a spring cap <b>32</b> that is likewise reciprocable within the capsule. A first end fitting <b>34</b> is coupled to an end of first cable <b>24</b>, and is provided to exert force upon spring cap <b>32</b> during actuation of a control mechanism <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Although the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown using an open-coil spring <b>30</b>, other materials having similar elastic properties may be employed to accomplish the same or similar functions as the spring. Such materials may include a compressible material <b>35</b> such as rubber, foam rubber or other elastomers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Second control cable section <b>14</b> includes a second sheath <b>36</b> and a second (inner) cable <b>38</b>, the second cable being disposed coaxially within the second sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. Second sheath <b>36</b> engages second end <b>20</b> of housing <b>16</b>, while second cable <b>38</b> passes into housing <b>16</b> through second end <b>20</b> and is coupled to a second end <b>42</b> of capsule <b>28</b> by a second end fitting <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during operation of this embodiment of the invention, coil spring <b>30</b> is in open-coil condition when not under a load. The spring rate of spring <b>30</b> is preferably designed having a value such that the spring remains essentially in an uncompressed state for the range of tension normally expected in a control cable for a particular latched device application. First control cable section <b>12</b> and second control cable section <b>14</b> are attached to one of a actuable latched device <b>44</b> and a control mechanism <b>46</b>, such as a lever, in any conventional manner. Exerting tension on one of either cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> by actuation of the control mechanism results in a tensing both of the cables causing slidable longitudinal movement of capsule <b>28</b> within housing <b>16</b>. This results in a corresponding movement of the opposing cable, thereby actuating and releasing the connected latched device. Thus, first and second control cable sections <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> function as a unitary control cable when operated within the design limits of a particular latched device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, in the event of an over-travel condition wherein the tension exerted on cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> exceeds a predetermined amount, capsule <b>28</b> bottoms out against end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b>, such as at an interior face <b>19</b>, which forms a first stop for the capsule. Alternatively, capsule <b>28</b> may bottom out against end <b>20</b> of housing <b>16</b>, such as at an interior face <b>21</b>, which forms a second stop for the capsule and is longitudinally spaced apart from the first stop. In some embodiments either or both ends of capsule <b>28</b> may be shaped to correspond to the size and shape of the adjacent stop, such as capsule second end <b>42</b> and face <b>21</b>. Spring <b>30</b> compresses as first end fitting <b>34</b> and spring cap <b>32</b> slidably move toward first end <b>26</b> of capsule <b>28</b>, allowing the effective length of cable wires <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> to increase until a mechanical stop (not shown) of the control mechanism or remotely actuated device is reached. This prevents excessive tension that could stretch or break the cable wires or damage connectors and end fittings (not shown) coupled to the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A functional schematic diagram of control cable assembly <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As can be seen, spring <b>30</b> is encased by capsule <b>28</b>. Spring <b>30</b> remains in an unloaded state and capsule <b>28</b> travels reciprocally within its corresponding housing <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) over the normal range of travel and tension of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> for a particular control mechanism and latched device <b>46</b>, <b>44</b>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). However, in the event of an over-travel condition, one end of capsule <b>28</b> bottoms out against interior face <b>19</b> at end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b> (or, alternatively, against interior face <b>21</b> at end <b>20</b> of the housing) causing spring <b>30</b> to compress as cable <b>24</b> is tensed in direction &#x201c;A,&#x201d; as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. The compression length of spring <b>30</b> is sufficiently long enough such that a mechanical stop of the control <b>46</b> and/or latched device <b>44</b> is reached before the spring becomes fully loaded (compressed, in this embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tension compensation assembly <b>101</b> for a control cable is shown according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Tension compensation assembly <b>101</b> is located intermediate a first control cable section <b>12</b> and a second control cable section <b>14</b>. First control cable section <b>12</b> engages housing <b>16</b> at a first end <b>18</b>. Conversely, second control cable section <b>14</b> engages housing <b>16</b> at a second, opposing end <b>20</b>. Housing <b>16</b> may be one of a variety of shapes, such as generally cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">First control cable section <b>12</b> includes a first sheath <b>22</b> and a first cable <b>24</b>, the cable wire being disposed coaxially within the first sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. First sheath <b>22</b> passes through and is captively retained by first end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b>, while first cable <b>24</b> passes into housing <b>16</b> through first end <b>18</b> via first sheath. First cable <b>24</b> then passes through a first opening or slot <b>102</b> of a first spring cap <b>104</b>. First cable <b>24</b> passes through the open longitudinal axis of a compression-type coil spring <b>30</b>, which may be helical as shown, and then through a first opening or slot <b>106</b> of a second spring cap <b>108</b>. A first end fitting <b>34</b> is coupled to an end of first cable <b>24</b>, and is provided to exert force upon spring cap <b>108</b> during actuation of a control mechanism (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Second control cable section <b>14</b> includes a second sheath <b>36</b> and a second cable <b>38</b>, the second cable being disposed coaxially within the second sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. Second sheath <b>36</b> passes through and is captively retained by second end <b>20</b> of housing <b>16</b>, while second cable <b>38</b> passes through a second opening or slot <b>110</b> of second spring cap <b>108</b>. Second cable <b>38</b> then passes generally through the center of spring <b>30</b>, generally parallel to first cable <b>24</b>, and then through a second opening or slot <b>112</b> of first spring cap <b>104</b>. A second end fitting <b>40</b> is coupled to the end of second cable <b>38</b>, and is provided to exert force upon spring cap <b>104</b> during actuation of a control mechanism (not shown). Spring <b>30</b> is thus captively retained between first and second spring caps <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> by cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b>, the spring, cable wires, spring caps and end fittings forming a tension compensation assembly <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during operation of this embodiment compression spring <b>30</b> is in its open-coil condition prior to the application of any significant load. The spring rate of spring <b>30</b> is preferably designed having a value such that the spring remains essentially in its uncompressed (unloaded) state over the normal range of tension expected in a control cable for a particular latched device application. First control cable section <b>12</b> and second control cable section <b>14</b> are attached to one of a latched device <b>44</b> and a control mechanism <b>46</b>, such as a lever, in any conventional manner. Exerting tension on one of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> with the control mechanism results in slidable longitudinal movement of tension compensation assembly <b>114</b> within housing <b>16</b>, resulting in axial movement of the opposing cable, thereby actuating and thus releasing the latched device. Thus, first and second control cable sections <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> cooperate to function as a unitary control cable when operated within the design limits of a particular remotely actuated latched device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, in the event of an over-travel condition, wherein the tension on inner cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> exceeds a predetermined amount, spring <b>30</b> compresses as first and second spring caps <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> move slidably toward each other, allowing the effective overall length of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> to increase until a mechanical stop (not shown) of the control mechanism <b>46</b> or latched device <b>44</b> is reached, thus preventing excessive tension that could stretch or break the cables or damage connectors and end fittings <b>34</b>, <b>40</b> coupled to the ends of the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A functional schematic diagram of control cable assembly <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. As can be seen, cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> pass generally parallel to one another through the center of compression-type coil spring <b>30</b> in opposing directions, each being attached to end caps <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> at opposing ends of the spring. Spring <b>30</b> remains substantially uncompressed as tension compensation assembly <b>114</b> travels reciprocally within housing <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) over the normal range of travel and tension of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> for a particular control mechanism <b>46</b> and latched device <b>44</b> application (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). However, in the event of an over-travel condition, spring <b>30</b> compresses as cable <b>24</b> is tensed in direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; and cable <b>38</b> is tensed in opposing direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;. The compression length of spring <b>30</b> is preferably such that a mechanical stop of the control mechanism and/or remotely latched device is reached before the spring reaches it fully loaded condition (fully compressed).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a control cable <b>200</b> having a tension compensation assembly <b>201</b> is shown according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. Tension compensation assembly <b>201</b> is interposed between a first control cable section <b>12</b> and a generally opposing second control cable section <b>14</b>. Tension compensation assembly <b>201</b> includes a housing <b>16</b>, which may be one of a variety of shapes, such as generally cylindrical. First control cable section <b>12</b> is coupled to housing <b>16</b> at a first end <b>18</b>. Likewise, second control cable section <b>14</b> is coupled to housing <b>16</b> at a second, opposing end <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First control cable section <b>12</b> includes a first sheath <b>22</b> and a first cable <b>24</b>, the cable being disposed coaxially within the first sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. First sheath <b>22</b> passes through and is captively engaged by first end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b>, while first cable <b>24</b> passes into housing <b>16</b> through first end <b>18</b> and into a first end <b>26</b> of a capsule <b>28</b>. Capsule <b>28</b> is slidably reciprocable within housing <b>16</b>. Cable <b>24</b> passes through an endpiece <b>202</b>. A first end fitting <b>34</b> is coupled to an end of first cable <b>24</b>, and is provided to exert parting force upon spring cap <b>108</b> during actuation of the control mechanism (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Second control cable section <b>14</b> includes a second sheath <b>36</b> and a second cable <b>38</b>, the second cable being disposed coaxially within the second sheath and longitudinally reciprocable. Second cable <b>38</b> passes into housing <b>16</b> through second end <b>20</b> and is coupled to a second end <b>42</b> of capsule <b>28</b> by a second end fitting <b>40</b> affixed to an end of the second cable. Both ends of a closed-coil extension spring <b>204</b> are preferably captively retained by end piece <b>202</b> and second end <b>42</b> of capsule <b>28</b>. As will be appreciated, alternate elastic means may be substituted for the extension spring without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Such alternative source of energy storage may include rubber bands, polymer strips or other spring configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during operation of this embodiment of the invention, extension spring <b>204</b> is in its unloaded, closed-coil condition with the adjacent coils of the spring in close proximity to or in contact with one another. The spring rate of spring <b>204</b> may be configured in nearly any predetermined value such that the spring remains substantially in its unloaded profile for the range of tension expected in a control cable assembly for a given latching application. First control cable section <b>12</b> and second control cable section <b>14</b> are attached to one of a latched device <b>44</b> and a control mechanism <b>46</b>, such as a lever, in any conventional manner. Applying tension on one of the cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> with the control mechanism results in slidable longitudinal movement of capsule <b>28</b> within housing <b>16</b>, resulting in a corresponding movement of the opposing cable section, thereby actuating and thus releasing the latched device. Thus, first and second control cable sections <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> cooperate to function as a unitary control cable when operated within the design limits of a particular latched device application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, in the event of an over-travel condition, wherein the tension on cable wires <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> exceeds a predetermined load condition, end <b>26</b> of capsule <b>28</b> bottoms out against interior face <b>19</b> of end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b> (or, alternatively, against interior face <b>21</b> at end <b>20</b> of the housing). At about that point, spring <b>204</b> extends as end piece <b>202</b> slidably moves toward first end <b>26</b> of capsule <b>28</b>, allowing the effective combined length of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> to increase until a mechanical stop of the control mechanism <b>46</b> or latched device <b>44</b> is reached, thus preventing excessive tension that could stretch or break the cables or damage connectors and end fittings (not shown) coupled thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A functional schematic diagram of control cable assembly <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. As can be seen, extension spring <b>204</b> is enclosed by capsule <b>28</b>. During normal operation, spring <b>204</b> remains in its substantially unloaded profile while capsule <b>28</b> travels reciprocally within housing <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) over the normal range of travel and tension of cables <b>24</b>, <b>38</b> for a particular control mechanism <b>46</b> and latched device <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). However, in the event of an over-travel condition, end <b>26</b> of capsule <b>28</b> may bottom out against interior face <b>19</b> of end <b>18</b> of housing <b>16</b> (or, alternatively, against interior face <b>21</b> at end <b>20</b> of the housing) at about which point spring <b>204</b> extends as cable <b>24</b> is tensed in direction &#x201c;A,&#x201d; as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The extension length of spring <b>204</b> is preferably such that a mechanical stop of the control mechanism and/or the latched device is encountered prior to the spring reaching its elastic limit.</p>
