<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An out-feed roller support stand having a sturdy, stable base that folds for compact storage. A support mast that telescopes into and is adjustable within the base supports a work support head that includes an adjustable cross bar on which a row of pivoting caster wheels are mounted. An alternative embodiment includes a ramp for guiding sagging ends of work-pieces up onto the caster wheels. Both the height and angle between the adjustable cross bar and floor are adjustable after the position of the support mast has been adjusted in order to position the support head in roughly the correct location.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to in-feed and out-feed roller supports and other conveyers for receiving and supporting material being processed, such as solid lumber or plywood being cut on a table saw.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When working with lumber or plywood or other man-made sheet materials, there is frequently a need to provide auxiliary support for those materials, particularly when using fixed tools such as table saws, router tables, thickness planers, and jointers. In these situations it is necessary to have the work-piece supported at both ends, both to insure an accurate cut and for safety reasons. Typically, the user is feeding the material into the tool, so the in-feed side of the material is supported by the tool user. Some sort of support is often required for the out-feed side of the machine. Furthermore auxiliary in-feed support is also sometimes needed, such as when extremely long stock is being machined.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This support needs to meet several requirements.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">1. It must be strong enough to support the weight of the material.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">2. It must be stable enough that the moving material cannot move it or tip it over, particularly when the material first contacts the support.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">3. It must be adjustable so that the work-piece-contacting portions of the support can be made level and in line with the work-piece supporting structure of the machine.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">4. It must offer low resistance to the moving material. This reduces the effort required by the operator and reduces the opportunity the material has for tipping the support over.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0009">5. It must not impart any directional forces on the work-piece. Re-directing a work-piece while it is being machined can result, at best, in an inaccurate cut; at worst it can result in the tool binding and, work-piece kick-back with resulting damage to tool and injury to user.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0010">Additional features are also desirable. For instance:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">6. It is desirable for the support to be easily positioned and adjusted.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">7. It is desirable for the support to be easy to store in a relatively small space.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">8. It is desirable for the support to be configured so that the advancing end of a work-piece will successfully engage and be supported by the support even of the end of the work-piece is sagging when it encounters the support.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0014">Numerous user-made and commercially manufactured supports are available. None include all of the features identified above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0015">For instance, a typical problem with existing out-feed supports is that it is difficult or impossible to get the support &#x201c;head&#x201d; exactly in line and level with the tool. This can be difficult for a number of reasons, including a shop floor for other support surface that is not level or a tool that is not set up perfectly level. Many existing out-feed supports provide for both height and angular adjustment of the head by providing a tube supporting the head that telescopes within a tube projecting from a base, or that is part of a base, and a thumb screw or male wing knob threaded through the base tube bears against the head support tube to lock it in position. The weight of the head tends to cause the head support tube to fall down into the base tube as soon as the thumb screw is loosened, and correct adjustment is very difficult because the weight of the head has to be supported with one hand while its height and angle are adjusted very accurately and the thumb screw is tightened. This needs to be accomplished without affecting head height or angular position, but the act of tightening the thumb screw often moves the position of the head as the screw acts on the support tube. Often this head positioning operation needs to be done while a work-piece is also being supported by the head and the machine with which the out-feed roller support is being used in order to establish the height at which the head needs to be positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0016">Out-feed stands or supports must have some sort of head that allows the work-piece to slide over it with very minimal resistance. There are two reasons for this. First, if there is high resistance to the material movement, the stand may simply be knocked over. Secondly, high resistance increases the force a user must apply to move the work-piece. This is undesirable from the point of view of fatigue, but, more importantly, it is also a safety issue. A slip while a user is applying force toward the tool blade or cutter can lead to operator contact with the blade and serious injuries. Typical existing roller stands generally incorporate either a single long roller, or a series of ball rollers for contact with the work-piece being supported. Each approach is less than ideal. A single long roller sufficiently distributes the load of the work-piece to prevent damage; however, unless this roller is carefully aligned with the machine, so that the roller axis of rotation is parallel to the machine work surface and perpendicular to the direction of travel of the work-piece, the roller will tend to guide the work-piece out of line rather than along its intended direction of travel. Multiple ball rollers do not need to be precisely aligned due to their multidirectional nature, however the point contact with the work-piece can lead to damage of the work-piece surface because the entire weight of the work-piece being supported by the support stand bears on the very small areas of contact with the balls.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0017">A support stand head needs to be level with the work surface of the machine with which it is being used. This is perhaps more critical than getting the stand at the same height, since the work-piece will be guided out of line if the out-feed head is not level with the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0018">Some out-feed stands address this issue by supplying adjustable feet to the stand. Alternatively, the angle of the head may be adjusted in prior art stands having masts that tilt relative to the floor by rotating the mast on which the head rests. Adjustment in this manner is very difficult because, among other reasons, it is difficult simultaneously to adjust the angle of the head and the projection of the mast from such prior art stands.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0019">The height and angle adjustment mechanisms of prior art stands often require substantial &#x201c;trial and error&#x201d; to correctly adjust the stand, and the time required to get it right often encourage use with less than optimal positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0020">For the reasons described above, among others, none of the prior art support stands address all of the needs of such a stand.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0021">The work piece support of this invention provides an easily adjusted support head that may be itself supported by a sturdy, stable base that folds for compact storage. A support mast telescopes into and is adjustable within the base but cannot rotate relative to the base. The mast supports a work support head that includes a fixed cross bar rigidly attached to the mast. The fixed cross bar supports an adjustable cross bar on which a row of pivoting caster wheels are mounted. Both the distance and angle between the fixed and adjustable cross bars are adjustable after the position of the support mast has been adjusted in order to position the support head in roughly the correct location. Provision of mechanisms for separately adjusting the height of the support head by substantial amounts and by small amounts, and relatively independent provisions for adjusting the support head height and angle by small amounts are significant aspects of this invention. Also significant to the success of this invention are the provision of angle and fine height adjustment mechanisms that fully support the head and any work-piece that may be resting on the head during adjustment, the absence of which is a significant failing of many of the prior art support stands. In some embodiments, a ramp or other structure is provided to guide the sagging end of a work-piece upward so that it will roll over the caster wheels as desired rather than pushing the support stand over or out of position. The stand is optional; the support head may rest directly on a relatively horizontal support surface such as a floor or a bench.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0031">In the exemplary embodiments of the supports <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> of this invention depicted in the drawings, a base <b>12</b> (that may be made of cast iron or a variety of other materials) includes legs and feet. In the support <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a front leg <b>14</b> and a rear leg <b>16</b> terminating in a pair of widely separated feet <b>17</b> provide a relatively heavy and very stable tripod base. The legs <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are hinged to pivot between the open position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a closed position enabling storage of the support <b>10</b> in a relatively thin space.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0032">The front leg <b>14</b> is a hollow tube that receives a support mast <b>18</b> that telescopes within leg <b>14</b> in order to provide substantial changes in the height above the floor of the support head <b>20</b> attached to the upper end <b>22</b> of mast <b>18</b>. The cross-sectional shapes of front leg <b>14</b> and mast <b>18</b> are preferable not round so that mast <b>18</b> cannot rotate within leg <b>14</b>. This can be accomplished, as shown in the illustrations, using a front leg <b>14</b> with an internal cross-sectional shape and a mast <b>18</b> external cross-sectional shape that are generally square, but other cross-sectional geometries are also possible. A thumb screw or male wing knob <b>24</b> or the like threaded into a fitting <b>26</b> near the top <b>19</b> of leg <b>14</b> can be tightened by rotating it to bear against the mast <b>18</b> and thereby lock it in a desired position within leg <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033">In the support <b>111</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a front leg <b>114</b> and rear leg <b>116</b> each terminate in a pair of widely separated feet <b>117</b> to provide an extremely stable base. Each leg <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> is pivotably attached to a mast support <b>112</b> to pivot between the splayed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the folded, storage position show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">Mast support <b>112</b> provides a sleeve <b>113</b> within which mast <b>18</b> slides to adjust the height of support <b>111</b>. Mast <b>18</b> is secured in sleeve <b>113</b> by wing knob <b>24</b> or any other suitable locking or securing mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">A fixed mast-head or cross-bar <b>30</b> is fixed on the upper end <b>28</b> of mast <b>18</b> by, for instance, welding the cross-bar <b>30</b> to the mast in an orientation so that cross-bar <b>30</b> will be generally parallel to the floor when mast <b>18</b> is properly positioned within leg <b>14</b>. Cross-bar <b>30</b> supports an adjustable platform or cross-bar <b>32</b>, on which caster wheels <b>36</b> are mounted. Caster wheels <b>36</b> are positioned so that the uppermost wheel <b>38</b> surfaces <b>40</b> are all in the same plane, regardless of the pivotal orientation of the wheel <b>38</b> axles <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">Height of the caster wheels <b>36</b> above the floor is adjustable in two ways. First, substantial changes in height, typically needed when changing the machine with which the support <b>10</b> is used, can be made by telescoping the mast <b>18</b> within leg <b>14</b>. Such adjustment is accomplished by loosening wing knob <b>24</b> to slide the mast <b>18</b> up or down and then re-tightening wing knob <b>24</b> to fix mast <b>18</b> in a new position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">Telescoping mast <b>18</b> into leg <b>14</b> also reduces the size of support <b>10</b> and the space required for its storage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">While this method of height adjustment by telescoping mast <b>18</b> within leg <b>14</b> will allow the head to be positioned approximately correctly, small adjustments in height by use of such an adjustment approach are difficult. This invention solves this problem by using telescoping only for approximate, large adjustments in height and by providing a different mechanism for small or fine adjustments in height.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039">Adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> is mounted on fixed cross-bar <b>30</b> with a set of links <b>42</b> that create, together with cross-bars <b>30</b> and <b>23</b>, a parallelogram structure. As will be appreciated by reference to the figures, a pair of links <b>42</b> on each of the front and back of the support head <b>20</b> allow the cross bars <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to move toward or away from each other while maintaining the same angle relative to each other. Such positions are fixed by a threaded rod <b>44</b> and may be changed by rotation of that rod <b>44</b>. Rod <b>44</b> fixed to pivot point <b>46</b> on adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> and passes through a threaded fitting <b>48</b> pivotably attached to fixed cross bar <b>30</b>. A knob <b>50</b> may be used to rotate threaded rod <b>44</b> in order to change the distance between pivot point <b>46</b> and fitting <b>48</b>, thereby changing the separation between adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> and fixed cross-bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">In the support <b>10</b> of this invention, the adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> portion of head <b>20</b> is pivoted to allow its angle to be adjusted in relation to the stand. In the illustrated embodiment, this is accomplished by attaching the lower ends <b>52</b> of one front and back pair of links <b>42</b> to an axle or link connector <b>54</b> that slides within slots <b>60</b> in fixed cross-bar <b>30</b>. A threaded cross pin <b>56</b> that may be rotated by a knob <b>58</b> is threaded through link connector <b>54</b>. The end <b>62</b> of threaded cross pin <b>56</b> is rotatably attached to fixed cross-bar <b>30</b>. Thus, rotation of knob <b>58</b> causes link connector <b>54</b> to travel up or down within slots <b>60</b>, thereby causing the angle between adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> and fixed cross-bar <b>30</b> to change so that the plane within which wheel surfaces <b>40</b> lie can be positioned parallel to the work table of the machine with which support <b>10</b> is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">The support <b>10</b> of this invention uses a line of wheels to virtually eliminate discernable friction between the support and a work-piece, regardless of the weight of the work-piece. The pivoting casters <b>36</b> are mounted so that they automatically align themselves with the direction the work-piece is traveling, and because the casters <b>36</b> pivot, the work-piece cannot be guided out of alignment by the support <b>10</b>, as can easily happen when a roller bar is used. Additionally, the wheels <b>38</b> provide a relatively large contact area (the sum of the wheel surfaces <b>40</b>) with the work-piece.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">While any desired number of caster wheels <b>36</b> can be used, eight casters <b>36</b> as shown in the figures is an appropriate number of caster wheels <b>36</b> in typical applications. Wheels <b>38</b> having a low durometer coating will further reduce the chance of damage to the work-piece. Such a coating may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset, including polyurethane and other materials.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">It is often necessary or desirable to place an out-feed support at a fairly substantial distance from the machine, such as a table saw, with which it is being used. This can mean, however, that the work-piece, such as a long board, is unsupported along a significant length and sags before reaching the out-feed support. When the end of such a sagging work-piece contacts the out-feed support lower than a certain point (approximately the level of the centers of the wheels <b>38</b> in the support <b>10</b> of this invention), it can push the support <b>10</b> out of position or cause it to tall over.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">The embodiments of this invention illustrated as support stands <b>11</b> and <b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref> include a ramp <b>70</b> positioned before the caster wheels <b>36</b> to guide a work-piece up and onto the wheels <b>38</b> of caster wheels <b>36</b>. The ramp <b>70</b> is angled to guide the leading edge of the work-piece up and onto the wheels <b>38</b>. Such a ramp <b>70</b> may be formed of sheet stainless steel; however, a variety of other materials may be used, provided that the resulting structure provides a relatively low friction, sloping surface positioned to cause the advancing edge of a work-piece to ride up from a level somewhat below the centers of wheels <b>38</b> to a level just a little below the highest portions of wheels <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As will be appreciated by those familiar with various materials, a metal ramp <b>70</b> could be covered with a low friction coating or film, and ramp <b>70</b> could be made of lower friction materials than metals, such as polymeric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">As will be appreciated by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>, particularly including <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the ramp <b>70</b> can be formed of bent sheet metal having (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) a sloping portion <b>72</b> attached at its lower edge to a generally horizontal portion <b>74</b> that in turn attaches to a vertical flange <b>76</b> that lies against the face <b>78</b> of adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> and under the upper ends of links <b>42</b>. The upper end of sloping portion <b>72</b> can be rolled edge <b>73</b> that presents a curved surface to support the work-piece once its end moves beyond ramp <b>70</b>. Ramp <b>70</b> can be attached to adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> with bolts <b>80</b> that pass through the flange <b>76</b> and through the adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> to be secured with nuts <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). By positioning bolts <b>80</b> in vertical slots <b>84</b> in the flange <b>76</b> of ramp <b>70</b>, the vertical position of the ramp <b>70</b> can be adjusted relative to the caster wheels <b>36</b>. One of the advantages of such adjustability is that it permits ramp <b>70</b> to be positioned with its top even with (or higher than) the highest portions of wheels <b>38</b> to provide support for work-pieces too narrow to be supported adequately by the wheels <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">In yet another embodiment of this invention, a tiltable planar support can be substituted for the fixed, height-adjustable ramp <b>70</b> described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>. In such an embodiment the structure for lifting the end of a sagging work-piece is a planar member or plate that is supported by arms, one or more stanchions or other structure pivotably attached to support base structure that extends away from the plate in a direction normal to the plate a distance greater than the maximum amount of expected work-piece sag before the work-piece encounters the support. The plate is initially pivoted so that it is roughly vertical and facing the advancing work-piece. When the work-piece end contacts the plate, because it does so above the pivot point, the plate tiles backward, which causes the lower portions of the plate to lift the work-piece end to the height of the plate when it reaches its horizontal position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">As will be understood by those skilled in the art, numerous configurations of supports can be practiced within the scope and spirit of this invention and the following claims in addition to the embodiments described above. Component substitutions are also possible. For instance, the ramp <b>70</b> of this invention and other components described above can be used with elongated rollers rather than the caster wheels described above and depicted in the drawings. Furthermore, all of the components of this invention can be made of a variety of materials. For instance legs <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and feet <b>17</b> can be made of a variety of materials, including steel, aluminum and other metals, plastics and other polymeric materials and composites, including, for instance, glass reinforced nylon and other polymeric materials. Legs <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>116</b> and feet <b>17</b> and <b>117</b> may be fabricated from tubular steel or other materials or cast in any suitable material. The other components can likewise be manufactured of a variety of different materials, including fabricated or formed steel, and cast metals, plastics and other materials, including composites. Various plastics are desirable materials for the wheels <b>38</b>, although other materials such as rubber or steel could be used. The wheels also can be coated with thermoplastic or thermoset plastics, including polyurethanes and other materials. However, wheels <b>38</b> can also be manufactured of a variety of other materials such as steel or other metals, plastics and natural and synthetic rubbers. Moreover, roller balls, one or more cylindrical rollers, or low friction fixed or tilting planar support surfaces can be used in the support of this invention rather than the plurality of caster wheels <b>36</b> shown in the figures and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">Cross-bar or mast-head <b>30</b> and cross-bar or platform <b>32</b> are shown in the figures as sections of rectangular cross-section tube (cross-bar <b>30</b> is illustrated as rectangular tube that is square). However, other structures such as solid bars, plates, sections of U-shaped or other shapes of channel, particularly including extruded aluminum channel, or other shapes, and a variety of materials, could be used for the cross-bars <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">Other mechanisms than those depicted in the drawings and shown above can also be used in accordance with this invention to provide a support head <b>20</b> that can be both adjusted in height through a substantial range of heights and can adjust in small, easily selected increments, the height and angle of the support wheels (or rollers, balls or other surface) relative to a machine.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">Provision is necessary for adjustment of each of (1) the height above the floor on which support <b>10</b> rests, and (2) the angle relative to the floor of the plane within which the support wheels or other structures lie. For instance, adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> could be mounted on fixed cross-bar <b>30</b> with two threaded rods rotatable in the same amount to change the height to the adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b> and rotatable in different amounts to change the angle of the adjustable cross-bar <b>32</b>. The threaded rod <b>44</b> does not have to connect to pivots <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> but could alternatively be attached to other points on the links <b>42</b>. In another alternative, it would be possible to drive one set of links <b>42</b> with a threaded rod running from a link <b>42</b> to the cross bar <b>30</b>. Other set of links will follow due to geometry. It would also be possible to pivot cross bar <b>30</b> on mast <b>22</b> and change the angle of the head <b>20</b> by such pivoting. Finally, it would be possible to adjust the angle of the head <b>20</b> by rotating it on or with the mast, provided that the mast is not vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">In yet another alternative, it would also be possible to mount casters <b>36</b> on a separate cross bar pivotably attached to the upper cross bar <b>32</b> enabling the angle to be changed there rather than by changing the angle of cross bar <b>32</b>.</p>
