<heading id="h-0001" level="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to passenger conveyors. More particularly, this invention relates to making a handrail for a passenger conveyor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Passenger conveyors are well known. A plurality of steps typically follow a loop for carrying individuals between landings at opposite ends of the conveyor. A handrail is often provided so that passengers can stabilize themselves as they travel along on the conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical handrail design has a flat surface that faces upward with rounded edges. The body of the handrail is often made from laminated sheets of material using adhesives, heat or pressure to secure the layers together. Some rubber handrails have been made using a molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One disadvantage to conventional handrail designs is that they do not provide an easily-gripped surface for a wide variety of passengers. A more ergonomically friendly design is desirable. Conventional manufacturing techniques, however, place limitations upon the shape of a handrail because of material cost and the bending stiffness required for a workable handrail.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another shortcoming of conventional handrail designs is that they typically rely upon a pinching drive arrangement that utilizes friction between a handrail and a drive mechanism that creates a normal force against the handrail sufficient for causing the handrail to move with the steps of the passenger conveyor. Such arrangements often cause marking and scuffing on the outer surface of the handrail. This leads to premature replacement of a handrail.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative drive arrangement is shown in Japanese Patent No. 2735453. In that document, rack teeth are formed on a handrail inner surface to cooperate with a drive mechanism for moving the handrail. While that document shows an improved driving arrangement for a handrail, the overall handrail design and method of manufacture are not ideal. Those skilled in the art are always striving to make improvements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention provides an improved handrail design and manufacturing technique that allows for implementing non-conventional handrail shapes and an improved driving arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example method of making a handrail for a passenger conveyor includes co-extruding a plurality of polymer materials to establish a passenger gripping surface from a first polymer material and an inner portion from a second polymer material. One example includes forming a toothed driving surface on the handrail. The toothed surface provides a drive surface for interacting with a drive mechanism that has a corresponding surface configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One example handrail includes a plurality of co-extruded polymer materials. A first one of the polymer materials has properties that establish a gripping surface and a second one of the polymer materials has properties that establish high wear resistance, for example, in an inner portion. The handrail in one example includes a toothed driving surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The various features and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of a currently preferred embodiment. The drawings that accompany the detailed description can be briefly described as follows.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a passenger conveyor <b>20</b> that includes a plurality of steps <b>22</b> that move in a known manner for carrying passengers between landings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. A handrail assembly <b>30</b> is associated with the plurality of steps <b>22</b> to allows passengers to brace themselves while riding on the conveyor <b>20</b>. The handrail assembly <b>30</b> includes a handrail and a balustrade <b>34</b>. A handrail guidance (not shown) facilitates the handrail <b>32</b> moving relative to the balustrade <b>34</b> to move in unison with the steps <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, in cross-section, one example handrail <b>32</b> designed according to an embodiment of this invention. In this example, the handrail <b>32</b> comprises a plurality of polymer materials. In this example, a first polymer material <b>34</b> and a second polymer material <b>36</b> are shown. More than two materials may be used to meet the needs of a particular situation. Two materials are illustrated for discussion purposes. Those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will be able to select appropriate materials and combinations of them to meet the needs of their particular situation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first polymer material <b>34</b> in one example comprises a thermoplastic polyurethane. In this example, the first polymer material <b>34</b> forms a relatively hard outer surface <b>38</b> that provides a passenger gripping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second polymer material <b>36</b> establishes an inner portion of the handrail <b>32</b>. Using a second material <b>36</b> allows for using a less expensive material on the inside of the handrail, for example. The outer layer or gripping surface <b>38</b> must have a certain durability on the surface, for example. The inner portion made of the second polymer material <b>36</b> need not have such a characteristic but should have reasonable wear resistance characteristics and cost-savings may be achieved by appropriately selecting one or more second polymer materials <b>36</b> to form the inner portion of the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one example, the second material <b>36</b> has a stiffness corresponding to a strength in the range from about 40 to about 50 mega pascal. In one example, the material has a shore hardness in a range from about 80 to about 90. Given this description, those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate material to meet their particular needs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Given the cross-section of the illustrated example, it is expected that relatively more raw material will be required for making the handrail <b>32</b> compared to conventional, more flattened-out designs. Using a plurality of materials allows for avoiding increased costs otherwise associated with a circular cross-section compared to the flattened-out designs of the past. In this example, there is some spacing that is not filled between the first polymer material <b>34</b> and the second polymer material <b>36</b>. This spacing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at <b>39</b>. Other examples may include a third polymer material filling that spacing. Such a third polymer material can be selected from even less expensive materials as it does not have any outside surface requirements associated with performance of the handrail. One advantage of the illustrated example is that material selections can be made that provide cost savings compared to conventional designs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, selecting various polymer materials allows for controlling the stiffness and bending characteristics of the handrail so that a desired durability and surface texture can be achieved within given cost constraints. Those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will realize what material combinations will work best for their particular situation. Commercially available or custom designed materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One feature of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that a toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is provided on an &#x201c;inner&#x201d; side of the handrail <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show example toothed driving surfaces <b>40</b>. In each example, recessed portions <b>42</b> are interdigitated with teeth <b>44</b> that provide a drive surface to be engaged by a toothed sprocket or a toothed belt, for example. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the teeth <b>44</b> do not project outward beyond a finished inner surface on the handrail. In that example, the recesses <b>42</b> do not extend across the entire length of the drive surface <b>40</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the recesses <b>42</b> are like grooves across the entire width of the drive surface <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illustrated example includes a low-friction material slider layer <b>46</b> that facilitates the handrail <b>32</b> moving along a guidance. In one example, the slider layer material is adhered to the second polymer material <b>36</b> after that is extruded and while the material is still warm enough to readily achieve a sufficient bond between the slider layer material and the second polymer <b>36</b>. In another example, the slider layer is fed through the extrusion machinery and adheres to the material during the extrusion process. In one example, the low friction slider layer comprises a known material used for conveyor handrail slider layers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates one example technique for forming the handrail <b>32</b> and establishing a toothed driving surface <b>40</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, molding machinery <b>50</b> includes a first extruder <b>52</b> that extrudes a first one of the polymer materials <b>34</b>, which is fed into the machinery <b>50</b> at <b>54</b>. A second extruder <b>56</b> extrudes a second polymer material <b>36</b>, which is fed in at <b>58</b>. The outputs from the extruders <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are provided to a common molding device <b>60</b>. In this example, the molding device <b>60</b> has a plurality of manifolds <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> as inputs for receiving the extruded materials <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. A single output <b>66</b> is shaped or includes a die to establish the configuration of the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The illustrated example uses co-extrusion of a plurality of polymer materials for forming the handrail. Co-extrusion techniques are known and those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will be able to select appropriate materials and techniques for achieving a handrail configuration to meet the needs of their particular situation. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> incorporates the use of the laminar flow principle that enables the two molten layers of material <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> under proper operating conditions to join them in the common flow channel of the mold <b>60</b> with minimum intermixing of the materials at the contacting interface between them. This provides the multi-portion handrail design (i.e., an inner portion and an outer portion) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, two chambers following the manifold inlets <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> each include a width, length and height with a required cross-section to establish the corresponding portions of the handrail. The resulting product <b>32</b>&#x2032; is stretched in the air and then passed through an arrangement for finishing the handrail. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first wheel <b>70</b> engages the driving surface <b>40</b> on the &#x201c;inner&#x201d; side to establish the toothed driving surface <b>40</b>. In one example, the wheel <b>70</b> has a serrated exterior that induces the teeth on the driving surface <b>40</b> by cutting or pressing the extruded handrail material to form the recesses <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a gripping surface finishing wheel <b>72</b> engages the gripping surface <b>38</b> and establishes a desired texture for the gripping surface. At the end of the process, a cooling bath <b>74</b> cools the materials of the handrail <b>32</b> so that it can be handled in a known manner for packaging and shipping to a job site.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example, the toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is established during the co-extrusion process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a load bearing member <b>80</b> is provided within the handrail <b>32</b>. In this example, a plurality of steel cords are supported at least partially within the second polymer material <b>36</b> to provide the load bearing member <b>80</b>. In one example, the toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is established in connection with providing the load bearing member <b>80</b> within the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows a mold wheel <b>82</b> that is included as part of the extrusion machinery in one example and has a plurality of projections <b>84</b> and recesses <b>86</b>. The steel cords of the load bearing member <b>80</b> are supported along the projections <b>84</b> in the extrusion machinery so that the appropriate polymer material at least partially encases the load bearing member <b>80</b> and fills the recesses <b>86</b> on the mold wheel <b>82</b>. As the extruded material and the load bearing member <b>80</b> leave the mold wheel <b>82</b> the material already has a driving surface similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In such an arrangement, the wheel <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be a guiding wheel without a serrated exterior surface to guide the handrail <b>32</b> toward the cooling bath <b>74</b>. The wheel <b>72</b> in such an example may be textured to provide a desired texture on the gripping surface on the handrail <b>32</b>. One example includes a control system for adjusting a required forming pressure on the driving surface <b>40</b>.</p>
