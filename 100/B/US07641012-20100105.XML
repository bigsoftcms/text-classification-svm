<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to the mounting of large modules, such as battery boxes, on motor vehicles. More particularly, the invention relates to a method using special locating fasteners that allow a module to be hung on a generally vertical side surface of a chassis frame rail before other conventional fasteners, are tightened to securely fasten the module in place.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Certain processes in the assembly of motor vehicles in an assembly plant require that a module be fastened to a generally vertical side surface of the vehicle structure. One example of this is the fastening of a battery box to the side of a chassis frame rail. Because larger modules like a battery box can have significant weight, it is preferable that an assembler not have to support the weight of the module while fastening it in place.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A prior method of assembling a battery box to a chassis frame rail comprises fastening two hanger brackets to the frame rail at mounting locations that are spaced apart along the length of the frame rail. The hanger brackets are stampings shaped to provide hanger hooks. The battery box has sides that include fastening formations shaped for association with the hanger brackets so as to allow the battery box to be hung on the hanger hooks before fasteners are run through the hanger brackets and the fastening formations in the sides of the battery box to securely fasten the battery box in place. In that way the weight of the box is borne by the frame rail and not by the assembler as the assembler is completing the fastening of the box to the frame rail.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an improvement over the prior method and fastening system because it does not use the separate brackets. Eliminating the brackets serves to reduce the number of unique parts that must be tooled and fabricated by a parts manufacturer and then stocked by an assembly plant. A weight savings may also result.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because separate brackets are not used, the invention facilitates the assembly process by eliminating the need to first assemble the brackets to the frame rail before hanging and fastening the battery box.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One general aspect of the invention relates to a method of locating and supporting a module on a chassis of an automotive vehicle. A fastener and element having an axially tapered outer surface are disposed on the chassis so as to place the tapered outer surface proximate a generally vertical surface of the chassis with the taper of the tapered outer surface narrowing in the axial direction toward the generally vertical surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The module comprises a tab comprising a generally downwardly open throat. The module is hung from the fastener by positioning the module and generally vertical surface of the chassis relative to each other so as to place the tab over the element on the fastener with the throat of the tab aligned with the element, and then relatively positioning the module and generally vertical surface of the chassis so as to cause the element on the fastener to enter the throat of the tab and the throat to come to rest on the element so that at least some of the weight of the module is borne on the chassis through the throat resting on the element. With the throat resting on the element, the tapered outer surface presents an axial interference to the tab beyond the tab relative to the generally vertical surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further aspect relates to one type of threaded fastener for use in hanging the module. The fastener comprising a main axis, a drive head at one axial end of an external spiral thread that runs along the main axis in one direction from the drive head, a radial flange at the junction of the drive head and the spiral thread, and a tapered annular flange that extends away from the drive head opposite the radial flange and that has a taper that narrows in the direction toward the radial flange.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further aspect relates to another type of fastener, namely a fastener assembly that in use provides for the module to be hung on an externally spiral-threaded member at a predetermined location of the chassis. The fastener assembly comprises a nut that has a main axis and an external drive surface that can be engaged by a tool for turning the nut about the main axis to thread the nut onto the externally spiral-threaded member via an internal spiral thread that runs along the main axis of the nut. The nut also has a radial flange at one axial end, and the fastener assembly further comprises an annular cap fitted onto an axial end of the nut opposite the radial flange comprising an outer surface that has a narrowing taper toward the radial flange.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further aspect relates to a vehicle chassis comprising a module having tabs each comprising a generally downwardly open throat and a chassis frame comprising a frame member from a generally vertical side of which spaced apart externally spiral-threaded members extend. Elements disposed on the threaded shanks abut the frame member and comprises tapered outer surfaces whose tapers narrow toward the generally vertical side of the frame member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The elements are arranged in a pattern that registers the throats of the module tabs with the elements and relates each to the other such that the tabs are supported via the throats on the elements while the tapered outer surfaces present interference to the tabs preventing the module from coming off the elements unless the module is elevated sufficiently to move the tabs out of interference with the tapered outer surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing, along with further aspects, features, and advantages of the invention, will be seen in the following disclosure of a presently preferred embodiment of the invention depicting the best mode contemplated at this time for carrying out the invention. The disclosure includes drawings, briefly described as follows.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a battery box <b>10</b> that has been hung on a side of a truck frame rail <b>12</b> that runs lengthwise of the truck. Battery box <b>10</b> has sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that extend outboard of rail <b>12</b> and that support a battery tray (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to provide battery box space for a bank of electric storage batteries B. After the box has been mounted on the rail, the batteries are placed in the box and are typically secured in place by any suitable means that prevents the batteries from shifting yet allows them to be removed when needed. In this particular box <b>10</b>, sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> extend further outboard of the battery bank to provide a mounting for a set of steps <b>18</b> by which the truck cab can be entered and exited.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inboard ends of sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are turned outward to form flanges <b>20</b>. Only the flange <b>20</b> on side <b>14</b> is visible in the Figures. Flanges <b>20</b> are disposed against a generally vertical outside face <b>22</b> of rail <b>12</b>, and each flange contains several through-holes <b>24</b> that are vertically spaced apart in a main part <b>26</b> of the flange.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At its top, each flange <b>20</b> is shaped to further comprise a locating tab <b>28</b> disposed further outward of its main part <b>26</b>. The locating tabs comprise downwardly open throats <b>30</b> having edges <b>32</b> that are generally semi-circularly shaped at the top and have tapered sides that open outward in the downward direction, extending to the bottom of the tab.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A first type of special fastener <b>34</b> is located on rail <b>12</b> at the locations of tabs <b>28</b> to provide for box <b>10</b> to be hung on the rail. Detail of fastener <b>34</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The fastener has a spiral threaded shank <b>36</b> and a drive head <b>38</b> at one end of the shank. Drive head <b>38</b> has a circular radial flange <b>40</b> at its junction with shank <b>36</b>. Opposite flange <b>40</b>, drive head <b>38</b> has an annular tapered flange <b>42</b> whose taper increases in the axial direction away from the drive head. This provides at that axial end of the fastener an open cavity <b>44</b> that leaves the central area of the drive head face open to allow a tool (not shown) to enter the cavity and engage a drive surface in the drive head for turning the fastener about its axis and threading it into a through-hole in rail <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> show fasteners <b>34</b> having been fastened to rail <b>12</b> from the outboard side and tightened in respective through-holes such that flanges <b>40</b> are abutting face <b>22</b>. In that way an outer tapered surface <b>46</b> of flange <b>42</b> and an outer circular surface <b>48</b> of each drive head <b>38</b> protrude immediately beyond the respective flange <b>40</b>. That allows box <b>10</b> to be hung on the fasteners by moving it from the position shown, as suggested by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> suggests that box <b>10</b> be positioned relative to rail <b>12</b> to locate tabs <b>28</b> over the respective fasteners very close to face <b>22</b>, with throats <b>30</b> aligned with the fasteners. In that position, box <b>10</b> can be lowered and in the process cause the respective fastener to enter the throat <b>30</b> of the respective tab <b>28</b>. The mouth of each throat <b>30</b> has a width greater than the diameter of surface <b>48</b>, and possibly even greater than the largest diameter of flange <b>42</b>. Depending on specific part dimensions, either the tapered sides of throat edges <b>32</b> or the generally semi-circular tops of edges <b>32</b> will come to rest on either surface <b>46</b> or surface <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably surface <b>48</b> has an axial dimension just slightly greater than the thickness of the respective tab <b>28</b> and a diameter just slightly less than that of the generally semi-circular top of edge <b>32</b> so that after the box has been hung, the top of edge <b>32</b> rests on surface <b>48</b>, and substantially all of the weight of the box will be borne on rail <b>12</b> through fasteners <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With the box having been hung on the fasteners, flanges <b>42</b> prevent the box from coming off the fasteners because of the box's own overhanging weight. The only way the box can come off is if it is elevated off the fasteners sufficiently for tabs <b>28</b> to clear the flanges and then moved away from rail <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With the box hung on the fasteners, mounting of the box can be completed. Through-holes <b>24</b> register with through-holes in rail <b>12</b>. The shanks of additional fasteners <b>50</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are passed through holes <b>22</b> and tightened in the frame rail holes thereby securing the box to the frame rail. Fasteners <b>50</b> can be conventional fasteners, meaning ones that do not have flanges <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> also show another embodiment of special fastener, specifically a fastener assembly <b>52</b> comprising a nut <b>54</b> and an annular cap <b>56</b>. Nut <b>54</b> has an internal spiral thread <b>58</b> and an external drive surface <b>60</b> that can be engaged by a tool for turning the fastener about the main axis of the assembly to thread the assembly onto an externally threaded member like shank <b>36</b> of fastener <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Annular cap <b>56</b> has an internal shape allowing it to be pushed onto one axial end of nut <b>54</b> after nut <b>54</b> has been tightened onto an externally threaded member like shank <b>36</b> of fastener <b>34</b>. Cap <b>56</b> comprises an outer surface <b>62</b> that has a narrowing taper in a direction away from the one axial end of the nut after having been pushed onto the nut at that one axial end. The taper of surface <b>62</b> is preferably frustoconical. A circular array of six retention teeth <b>64</b> comes into engagement with the shank of the externally threaded member as the cap is being fitted onto the nut. A second end of the nut opposite the first end has a flange <b>66</b> that limits how far the cap can be pushed on.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">From this description, it can be appreciated that nut <b>54</b> and cap <b>56</b>, when assembled together, form an assembly <b>52</b> that is essentially functionally equivalent to the drive head and flange of fastener <b>34</b>, and therefore capable of preventing a tab <b>28</b>, when its throat <b>30</b> is placed on surface <b>62</b>, from coming off unless the module containing the tab <b>28</b> is elevated sufficiently to cause the tab to clear outer surface <b>62</b> of cap <b>56</b>, and then moved away. Depending on specific dimensions of parts and on how far cap <b>56</b> is pushed onto nut <b>54</b>, the narrow end of surface <b>62</b> may abut flange <b>64</b>, in which case the fastener assembly has no outer surface corresponding to the circular surface <b>48</b> of fastener <b>24</b>, or if surface <b>62</b> stops short of flange <b>66</b>, the exposed portion of the outer surface nut <b>54</b> would correspond to the circular surface <b>48</b> of fastener <b>24</b>, but the exposed nut surface may be non-circular if it a portion of the drive surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While a presently preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it should be appreciated that principles of the invention are applicable to all embodiments that fall within the scope of the following claims.</p>
