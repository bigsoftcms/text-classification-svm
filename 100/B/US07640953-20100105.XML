<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a machine for filling containers with a product.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More specifically, the present invention relates to a machine for filling capsules with a powdered pharmaceutical product, to which the following description refers purely by way of example.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the pharmaceutical industry, a machine for filling capsules with a powdered pharmaceutical product is known comprising a conveying device, which is movable continuously along a given path and has a number of pockets, each for receiving a respective bottom shell of a relative capsule; a container containing the product; and a metering wheel mounted to rotate continuously about a respective longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The metering wheel has a number of metering devices, each of which is movable with the metering wheel along a portion of said path, in time with a relative bottom shell, to withdraw the product from said container and feed the product into the bottom shell, and comprises a cylinder and a piston moving vertically with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cylinder and piston are moved with respect to each other by respective actuating devices, each of which comprises at least one cam located over said container, and at least one tappet cooperating with the cam. The piston actuating device also comprises at least one spring fitted to the piston and interposed between the piston and the cylinder to keep the relative tappet normally in contact with the relative cam.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the end of each operating cycle of the machine, the powdered pharmaceutical product scattered about the metering wheel must be stabilized to prevent it being inhaled by machine maintenance and cleaning personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the product is stabilized by spraying water on the metering wheel and, therefore, on the actuating devices, known machines of the above type have several drawbacks, mainly due to the fact that, to prevent corrosion and rusting, the cams, tappets, and springs of the metering devices must be made of stainless steel, have a relatively short working life, and require frequent maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another drawback of known machines of the above type lies in the presence and size of the cams seriously impairing the effectiveness of the product stabilizing and machine washing operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide a machine for filling capsules with a product, designed to eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, there is provided a machine for filling capsules with a product, as claimed in the attached Claims.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With the interposition of a supporting bracket <b>62</b>, a substantially cylindrical piston <b>63</b> is fixed to the top end of shaft <b>45</b>, projects downwards from bracket <b>62</b>, engages relative cylinder <b>39</b> in sliding manner, and has a diameter approximately equal to but no larger than the diameter of narrow bottom portion <b>42</b> of cylinder <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Operation of machine <b>1</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> and the filling of one bottom shell <b>3</b>, and as of the instant in which the bottom shell <b>3</b> considered and the relative metering device <b>28</b> have been fed in time with each other into pickup station <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref><i>a</i>), and device <b>28</b> is positioned facing container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At station <b>29</b>, cylinder <b>39</b> and piston <b>63</b> of metering device <b>28</b> considered are first lowered in direction <b>34</b> by respective cams <b>35</b> and <b>47</b> into contact with the top surface of the product inside container <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>); piston <b>63</b> is then maintained contacting the top surface of the product by means of a further cam (not shown) projecting beneath cam <b>47</b> and engaged by a tappet roller <b>64</b> carried by shaft <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>), while cylinder <b>39</b> is lowered into the product by cam <b>35</b> to define the correct amount of product to be withdrawn (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>); cylinder <b>39</b> and piston <b>63</b> are again lowered by respective cams <b>35</b> and <b>47</b> in time with each other, so as to move cylinder <b>39</b> into contact with container <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>); and piston <b>63</b> is lowered further, to compact the product contained between cylinder <b>39</b> and piston <b>63</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>), by a cam <b>65</b> projecting beneath can <b>47</b> and engaged by roller <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At this point, by combining the movement of device <b>28</b> about axis <b>6</b> with the movement of cylinder <b>39</b> and piston <b>63</b> in direction <b>34</b>, device <b>28</b> is disengaged from container <b>20</b> and fed to filling station <b>30</b> where, container <b>20</b> being mounted eccentrically with respect to drum <b>10</b>, cylinder <b>39</b> and piston <b>63</b> are positioned facing relative pocket <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finally, piston <b>63</b> is lowered, to discharge the withdrawn product into relative bottom shell <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>), by a cam <b>66</b> projecting beneath cam <b>47</b> and engaged by roller <b>64</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Actuating devices <b>33</b>, <b>46</b> being housed inside casing <b>67</b>, the powdered pharmaceutical product scattered about metering wheel <b>4</b> may therefore be stabilized easily at the end of each operating cycle of machine <b>1</b>, thus permitting troublefree cleaning and maintenance of machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Machine <b>1</b> also has the further advantage of pneumatic push device <b>49</b> enabling selective control of the operation of each metering device <b>28</b>. More specifically, when a solenoid valve <b>60</b> disconnects pneumatic circuit <b>55</b> of relative metering device <b>28</b> from said compressed-air pneumatic device (not shown), relative piston <b>63</b> remains by force of gravity in a lowered position completely closing the narrow bottom portion <b>42</b> of relative cylinder <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this way, each metering device <b>28</b> can be prevented from withdrawing the product from container <b>20</b> when:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">the metering device <b>28</b> is fed through pickup station <b>29</b> in time with a pocket <b>19</b> having no bottom shell <b>3</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">machine <b>1</b> is started up to feed the product into container <b>20</b>, and pockets <b>19</b> have no bottom shells <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In connection with the above, it should be pointed out that the downward gravitational thrust exerted on pistons <b>63</b> may be increased by selectively connecting relative circuits <b>55</b>, by means of relative solenoid valves <b>60</b>, to a known pneumatic suction device not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a variation not shown, solenoid valves <b>60</b> are eliminated, and chambers <b>54</b> are connected permanently to said compressed-air pneumatic device (not shown). In which case, the narrow bottom portion <b>42</b> of each cylinder <b>39</b> is closed, to prevent withdrawal of the product from container <b>20</b> in the aforementioned situations, by two deflecting cams, which are mounted at pickup station <b>29</b>, and are inserted selectively along the paths of respective tappet rollers <b>36</b> and <b>48</b> in lieu of respective cams <b>35</b> and <b>47</b>. The deflecting cams are designed to keep each piston <b>63</b> in the lowered position closing the narrow bottom portion <b>42</b> of relative cylinder <b>39</b>, and, at pickup station <b>29</b>, to move piston <b>63</b> and relative cylinder <b>39</b> over container <b>20</b> to prevent withdrawal of the product from container <b>20</b>.</p>
