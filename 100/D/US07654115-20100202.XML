<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to bras made of tubular knit fabric, and more particularly to bras made of tubular knit fabric flattened into a two ply fabric.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bras of knitted fabric are known for use particularly as sports bras worn during physical activity because of their inherent stretchability and resulting body conformability. Because of the comfort of such bras, their use is not limited only to wear during physical activities, but are desirable and advantageous for general use as well.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional knitted bras may be formed of circular knit tubes with the circumference of the tubes extending around the torso of the wearer, or the tube being flattened and cut to form integral shoulder straps and folded to form front and rear bra portions that are secured together at side seams. In either case, time consuming and expensive cutting and sewing operations are required, resulting in an expensive waste of cut away material. Also, importantly, shoulder straps are either formed from separate pieces of edging or ribbons of fabric having ends secured to the main body portion, or the tube is knit of sufficient height to provide material for integral strap portions, resulting in an additional waste of material. Further, uncomfortable and conspicuous edge binding material or ribbons are conventionally required to cover the edges of the main body portion and the edges of the shoulder straps.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are also tubular knit bras which are formed of flattened knit tubes with ends sewn or connected to form a body encircling two ply fabric. An illustration of this type of bra is disclosed in Novi U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,899, which discloses breast pocket portions formed by distending the fabric by forming and stabilizing by heat and pressure. The disclosed bra is strapless or, alternatively, has conventional shoulder straps secured to the main body portion. Another example of a strapless circular knit bra is disclosed in Albright U.S. Pat. No. 5,850,745, which discloses a tubular knit fabric that is slit axially to form two separate single ply bras that extend around the torso of the wearer with breast pocket peripheries formed of elastic fabric. This patent also discloses a single ply tubular knit strapless bra with its axis extending vertically of the wearer and with edges knit with turned welts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the prior art discloses tubular knit bras that are flattened to form a two ply fabric that encircles the body of the wearer, such prior art bras either are strapless or utilize conventional narrow, relatively hard, shoulder straps and are not knit in a varying pattern that provides any different structural fabric characteristics in different areas of the bra for advantageous fitting characteristics, except for the breast pocket areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly described, the tubular knitted fabric bra of the present invention is formed from a length of circular knit material flattened into a double ply fabric having ends secured together to form a body encircling main bra portion having rounded top and bottom edges. Shoulder straps are formed of a pair of lengths of circular knit material flattened into double ply fabrics having ends secured to the main bra portion and having rounded side edges. This results in a bra that can be rapidly and inexpensively produced with the resulting garment being free of any uncomfortable and unsightly edging strips either on the main body portion or on the shoulder straps, and the shoulder straps can be sufficiently wide, which in combination with the absence of edging material provides comfort without digging into the shoulders of the wearer, which is particularly advantageous when the bra is worn during physical activities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Being tubular knit with the axis of the tube encircling the torso of the wearer, a relatively narrow tube can be knit. Therefore, the fabric can be rapidly and inexpensively knit using hosiery knitting machines. The fabric is made of elastic yarn with the knitting pattern being variable to produce desirable stretchable and relatively non-stretchable sections in the fabric to suit desired characteristics in the finished bra. For example, the main bra portion may be formed with a pair of enlarged, relatively loosely knit, relatively highly resiliently stretchable breast pockets, which may be formed in both plies of the double ply bra fabric. To provide uplifting support without the need for additional material or inserts, relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable sections may be provided along the bra below the breast pockets. Advantageously, the ends of the shoulder straps are flared outwardly to ends secured to the main body portion at the breast pockets to form continuations of the breast pockets. Further, support of the breast pockets can be enhanced by having the lower areas of the breast pockets slightly more tightly knit and less resiliently stretchable than the upper areas of the breast pockets.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To provide form fitting stability with desired stretchability, side sections may be formed in the bra of relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable areas extending from the breast pockets to a moderately loosely knit, moderately resiliently stretchable back section. Preferably, the side sections have relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable, pronounced ribbed fabric areas extending from adjacent the breast pockets and tapering rearwardly and downwardly to form complementary tapered areas of relatively lesser tightly knit fabric. These areas provide desired form fitting support in the bra.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The ends of the tubular knit fabric are secured together between the breast pockets, where the sewn seam will be of little or no discomfort to the wearer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As illustrated in the accompanying drawings, the knitted fabric bra <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention has a tubular knit main body portion <b>12</b> and a pair of tubular knit shoulder straps <b>14</b>. It is knit of elastic yarn, such as a nylon wrapped spandex core yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The main body portion <b>12</b> is formed from a tubular length of circular knit material <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), with the length <b>18</b> forming a torso encircling main body portion <b>12</b>. Being circular knit flattened fabric, the main body portion <b>12</b> has rounded top and bottom edges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively, such that no edging or other strips are necessary to cover edges that are formed in prior art bras when cutting material to the shape of the bra from woven material or from single ply tubular knit material or two ply material where the axis of the tube is vertical with respect to the wearer. The resulting smooth edges avoid the uncomfortable, irritating and unsightly edges of bras that are particularly disadvantageous when the bra is worn during physical activity.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shoulder straps <b>14</b> are similarly formed from a pair of lengths of circular knit material flattened into double ply fabrics that form relatively wide shoulder straps with the vertical axis of the lengths of material extending vertically with respect to the wearer, resulting in side edges <b>24</b> formed by the folded edges of the lengths of material, which, like edges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b>, require no edging or other strip material on the edges, thereby avoiding the discomfort, irritation and unsightliness of conventional shoulder straps, which advantage is enhanced by the shoulder straps <b>14</b> being of sufficient width to avoid digging into the shoulders of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in the preferred embodiment, the main body portion <b>12</b> has a pair of enlarged, relatively loosely knit, relatively highly resiliently stretchable breast pockets <b>26</b> that are resiliently stretchable to comfortably contain and support the breasts of the wearer without requiring stretching of the adjacent sections of the main body portion <b>12</b>. These breast pockets <b>26</b> are formed in both plies of the double ply bra fabric. The outer ply has lower areas <b>26</b><i>a </i>of slightly tighter knit fabric than the upper areas <b>26</b><i>b </i>to enhance breast pocket support. These slightly tighter knit lower areas <b>26</b><i>a </i>may also be formed on the inner ply, or both plies may be knit with the fabric of the upper areas <b>26</b><i>b </i>extending throughout the breast pockets <b>26</b>, to provide different shapes and sizes as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To provide form and support for the breast pockets <b>26</b>, relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable under-sections <b>28</b> are provided below the breast pockets <b>26</b> in the main body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To provide form fitting characteristics to the main body portion <b>12</b>, relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable side sections <b>30</b> extend from the breast pockets <b>26</b> to a moderately loosely knit, moderately resiliently stretchable back section <b>32</b> that extends between and is connected to the two side sections <b>30</b> across the back of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The side sections <b>30</b> have areas <b>52</b> of pronounced tightly knit ribbed fabric that extend the full height of the side sections <b>30</b> adjacent the breast pockets <b>26</b> and for a portion of the lengthwise extent of the side sections <b>30</b>, and then taper rearwardly and downwardly to define complementary tapered areas <b>54</b> of lesser tightly knit ribbed fabric thereabove. These areas <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> provide desired relative form fitting support in the bra <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Between the breast pockets <b>26</b> there is a moderately loosely knit, moderately resiliently stretchable, relatively short, front section <b>34</b>, which serves to connect and vertically gather the material of the breast pockets <b>26</b>. In the center of the front section <b>34</b>, the ends <b>16</b> of the length of material forming the main body portion <b>12</b> are sewn together by a seam <b>38</b> to close the length of material into an endless circular loop. This location of the seam <b>38</b> in the front section <b>34</b> minimizes irritation and discomfort in comparison with a seam located in the sides or back where relative movement of the skin of the wearer with respect to the bra would be more pronounced.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The circular knit flattened double ply shoulder straps <b>14</b> have front sections <b>40</b> that flare outwardly substantially in width to ends <b>42</b> that are sewn to the top of the breast pockets <b>26</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b> in a seam <b>44</b>. These front sections <b>16</b> of the shoulder straps <b>14</b> advantageously provide upper continuations of the breast pockets <b>26</b>. The shoulder straps <b>14</b> have back ends <b>64</b> sewn to the back section <b>32</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b>, with the shoulder straps slightly inwardly flaring from the ends <b>64</b> to relatively wide straight sections <b>68</b>. These sections <b>68</b> extend to near the center of the shoulder straps, at which the shoulder straps taper inwardly, as illustrated at <b>70</b>, to a somewhat narrower straight section <b>72</b>, from which the length <b>48</b> flares outwardly substantially to form the aforesaid front sections <b>40</b> that terminate in the front ends <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> illustrate the bra <b>10</b> in its relaxed, unworn condition, illustrating, in particular, the gathered folds <b>46</b> in the breast pockets <b>26</b> that provide the fabric that is stretched when worn to contain and support the breasts of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The length <b>18</b> of circular knit material in the form of a tube in which it is knit prior to being flattened to form the main body portion <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The end <b>16</b> at the bottom of the figure is the first portion to be knit. Knitting then progresses through the adjacent part of the front section <b>34</b>, which is moderately loosely knit and moderately resiliently stretchable. This part of the front section <b>34</b> is relatively short. The front section <b>34</b> flares somewhat outwardly, as indicated at <b>50</b>, where it is followed by the breast pocket <b>26</b> and the relatively tightly knit, relatively non-stretchable under-section <b>28</b> that begins at almost the full height of the breast pocket <b>26</b> at the juncture with the front section <b>34</b> and curves to result in an enlargement of the breast pocket <b>26</b> with the breast pocket <b>26</b> and under-section <b>28</b> being knit simultaneously, the breast pocket being relatively loosely knit, relatively highly resiliently stretchable fabric that is gathered in folds <b>46</b> when relaxed, and has a lower area <b>26</b><i>a </i>slightly tighter knit than the upper area <b>26</b><i>b</i>. The simultaneous knitting of the breast pocket <b>26</b> and under-section <b>28</b> continues with the under-section <b>28</b> then increasing in size with the breast pocket <b>26</b> decreasing correspondingly to provide curvature of the ultimate underside of the breast pocket <b>26</b> to a point where the knitting of the breast pocket <b>26</b> and under-section <b>28</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Knitting then progresses through the side section <b>30</b>, which is relatively tightly knit and relatively non-stretchable, beginning with a pronounced ribbed fabric area <b>52</b> that extends continuously around the length <b>48</b> through a first area of the side section <b>30</b> and then tapers to a reduced circular extent in combination with a complementary relatively lesser ribbed fabric area <b>54</b> of slightly lesser tightly knit fabric to form the complete side section <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Following the knitting of the side section <b>30</b>, knitting of the tubular length <b>48</b> continues with the knitting of the back section <b>32</b>, which begins with a short transition portion <b>56</b> that tapers slightly inwardly to an intermediate portion <b>58</b> to a slightly narrowed middle portion <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Knitting then continues in the reverse order and is completed when the upper end <b>12</b> of the length of material <b>18</b> is knit and the length of material <b>18</b> is removed from the knitting machine. The ends <b>16</b> of the length <b>18</b> of material are then sewn together to form the main body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One length <b>48</b> of circular knit material that forms a shoulder strap <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The front end <b>42</b> of the length <b>48</b> is seen at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This is the end that is sewn to a breast pocket <b>26</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b> and is relatively wide so as to form a connection with the breast pocket <b>26</b> from which knitting continues at a substantial inward tapering to form the outward flaring front section <b>40</b> as a continuation of the breast pocket <b>26</b>. This is followed by knitting of a relatively narrow straight portion <b>72</b> that initially continues the inward tapering from the front section <b>40</b> to a narrow straight width. Following the relatively narrow straight section <b>72</b>, the knitting continues with an outward flaring, at <b>70</b>, to a relatively wider straight section <b>68</b>, from which knitting continues to form a slightly outward flaring rear section <b>66</b>, to an end <b>64</b> that will be connected to the back section <b>32</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the tubular length <b>18</b> of the main body portion and the tubular lengths <b>48</b> of the shoulder straps <b>14</b> are knit, they are flattened. The shoulder straps <b>14</b> are then sewn to the length <b>18</b> of the main body portion material and the ends <b>16</b> of the length <b>18</b> are then sewn together to complete the bra <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the ends <b>16</b> of the tubular length <b>18</b> may be sewn together first, to complete the main body portion <b>12</b> and then the ends <b>42</b> and <b>64</b> of the shoulder straps <b>14</b> may be sewn at the front to the breast pockets <b>26</b> and at the rear to the back section <b>32</b> to complete the bra <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The comparative words &#x201c;relatively&#x201d; and &#x201c;moderately&#x201d; as used herein are to be understood to mean the relation of the characteristics of one section or area of the bra <b>10</b> in comparison with other sections and areas.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the entire bra <b>10</b>, i.e., both the main body portion <b>12</b> and the shoulder straps <b>14</b>, is knit on a 400 needle, 4 feed, 4 inch cylinder hosiery knitting machine, such as a Matec HF 4.7 VM (Variable Movement, i.e., the stitch cam is controlled to go in and out and up and down) using a stretch yarn having a spandex core covered by a textured stretch nylon filament yarn wrapped around the core.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following description and claims, the yarn designation &#x201c;--/--/--&#x201d; designates the denier of the spandex core/the denier of the textured stretch nylon filament yarn cover/and the number of filaments in the nylon cover yarn. The dimensions recited are the approximate dimensions of the fabric in relaxed state. The following description applies to the knitting of a typical size 34, C or D cup, bra with the dimensions and stitch heights in each section or area being variable to suit different bra sizes and cups.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, knitting of a preferred embodiment of the tubular length of circular knit material <b>18</b> that forms the main body portion <b>12</b> having a relaxed length of about 55 mm. begins by knitting the initial makeup at the end <b>16</b>, which is knit with a 1&#xd7;1 alternate needle selection, using two feeds, with one end of 20/30/34 yarn in each feed at a stitch height of 1.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The front section <b>34</b> is then knit with 1&#xd7;1 alternate positive needle selection using two feeds with two ends of 20/30/34 in each feed and progressing for approximately 1 mm. from a stitch height of 1.5 mm. to a stitch height of 2.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Knitting then progresses with the simultaneous knitting of the under-section <b>28</b> and the breast pocket <b>26</b>, including the lower section <b>26</b><i>a </i>and upper section <b>26</b><i>b</i>, for approximately 12 mm., varying from 10 to 12 mm. from bottom to top in relaxed state due to the different stretch characteristics of the sections. The under-section <b>28</b> is knit in a 1&#xd7;1 alternate tuck using two feeds with 3 ends of 20/70/72 in each feed and a stitch height of 0.5 mm. The breast pocket <b>26</b> is knit in a jersey knit using two feeds. The lower area <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the breast pocket is knit with three ends of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed at a stitch height of 2.5 mm. The inside ply of area <b>26</b><i>a </i>is knit with 1 to 3 ends of yarn in each feed, depending on the size of the garment to provide a desired fit and form. The upper area <b>26</b><i>b </i>is knit with one end of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed and a stitch height of 1.5. mm. Starting at the juncture with the front section <b>34</b>, the first course of the under-section <b>28</b> and breast pocket areas <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>is knit with the under-section <b>28</b> extending through about one-half of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>, the outer ply of the under area <b>26</b><i>a </i>is knit through approximately one-eighth of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>, the upper area <b>26</b><i>b </i>is knit through about one-quarter of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b> and the inner ply of the lower area <b>26</b><i>a </i>is knit through about one-eighth of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>. Knitting then progresses with the under-section <b>28</b> decreasing coursewise through about one-third of the length of the sections to an extent of approximately three-sixteenths of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b> and the upper area <b>26</b><i>b </i>increasing to an extent of approximately nine-sixteenths of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>. Each ply of the under area <b>26</b><i>a </i>remains extending approximately one-eighth of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b> throughout the entire section. Knitting then continues without change for approximately another third of the length of the sections, after which the under-section <b>28</b> increases for the remaining one-third of the sections to approximately nine-sixteenths of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>, and the upper section <b>26</b><i>b </i>decreases to approximately three-sixteenths of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Knitting then continues with the knitting of the fabric of the side section <b>30</b>, which extends approximately 10 mm., beginning with the tightly knit pronounced ribbed fabric <b>52</b> in a 2&#xd7;2 clear float needle selection using two feeds with 3 ends of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed and a stitch height of 2.0 mm. This continues over the full circumference of the tube <b>18</b> for approximately one-quarter of the length of the side section <b>30</b>. From that point on, knitting progresses with the number of needles knitting the pronounced rib fabric <b>52</b> decreasing for the remaining three-quarters of the length of the side section to a point at which the back section <b>32</b> will be knit, at which point the pronounced ribbed fabric <b>52</b> will extend over approximately one-quarter of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>. As this tightly knit fabric <b>52</b> is being knit in this taper, the relatively lesser tightly knit fabric <b>54</b> begins and increases from the point at which the tightly knit fabric <b>52</b> begins tapering to the point at which the back section <b>32</b> begins, at which the relatively lesser tightly knit fabric <b>54</b> extends over approximately three-quarters of the circumference of the tube <b>18</b>. This relatively lesser tightly knit fabric <b>54</b> is knit in a 1&#xd7;1 clear float needle selection using two feeds with 3 ends of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed and a stitch height of 2.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Knitting of the back section <b>32</b> begins with the knitting of the short transition portion <b>56</b>, which is jersey knit with two feeds of one end of 20/70/72 in each feed and decreasing from a stitch height of 2.0 mm. to 1.0 mm. over approximately one-tenth of the length of the back section <b>32</b>, which is approximately 14 mm. in length. The intermediate portion <b>58</b> is then knit in a 1&#xd7;1 alternate positive needle selection on one feed and a jersey needle selection on a second feed, with one end of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed, beginning with a needle height of 1.0 mm. and decreasing over approximately one-quarter of the length of the back section <b>32</b> to 0.5 mm. The middle portion <b>60</b> of the back section <b>32</b> is then knit with a 1&#xd7;1 alternative positive needle selection using 1 end of 20/70/72 in each feed at a needle height of 0.5 mm. over approximately three-tenths of the length of the back section <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Knitting then continues by knitting an identical reverse intermediate portion <b>58</b> and transition portion <b>56</b>, and a reverse of the above described sequence of knitting of sections and areas to complete the knitting of the length of material <b>18</b> to form the body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, knitting of a preferred embodiment of the length of circular knit material <b>48</b> that forms a shoulder strap <b>14</b> of a relaxed length of approximately 28 mm. begins by knitting of the make-up front end <b>42</b>, which is knit in a 1&#xd7;1 positive needle selection on all four feeds with one end of 20/70/72 yarn in each feed at a stitch height of 2.5 mm. Knitting then continues to knit the tapered front section <b>40</b> with a 1&#xd7;1 positive needle selection on two feeds and a jersey knit needle selection on two other feeds using one end of 20/70/72 yarn in each of the four feeds, and with the stitch height decreasing from 2.5 mm. to 2.0 mm., over a length of approximately one-eighth of the length of the shoulder strap material <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Knitting then continues, knitting the relatively narrow straight section <b>72</b> with a 1&#xd7;1 random needle selection at all four feeds with an end of 20/23/28 yarn at each feed, at a stitch height decreasing initially from 2.0 to 0.5 mm. and then continuing at the 0.5 mm. stitch height over a length of approximately one-half of the length of the shoulder strap material <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wider straight section <b>68</b> is then knit with a 1&#xd7;1 and a 1&#xd7;3 alternating positive needle selection on all four feeds using the same 20/23/28 yarn in each feed at a stitch height of 0.5 mm. This results in a slight outward flaring, at <b>70</b>, in the transition from the relatively narrow section <b>72</b> to the relatively wider section <b>68</b>, which continues at the 0.5 mm. stitch height for approximately one-quarter of the length of the shoulder strap material <b>48</b>. This is then followed by an increase of the stitch height from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. over approximately one-eighth of the length of the shoulder strap material <b>48</b> to form the rear section <b>66</b>, ending at the rear end <b>64</b> of the length of material <b>48</b>.</p>
