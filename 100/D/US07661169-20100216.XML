<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a drum washing machine which is capable of lifting clothes to a predetermined height and then dropping the lifted clothes so that the clothes can be washed by means of friction and impact, and more particularly to a steam jet drum washing machine which is capable of heating wash water and spraying the heated wash water into a tub and a drum of the washing machine in a phase of high-temperature and high-pressure steam, whereby sterilizing and washing efficiencies of the drum washing machine are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A drum washing machine is a kind of washer which is capable of washing clothes by friction between a drum rotated by a motor and the clothes put in the drum while a detergent and wash water are supplied in a horizontally mounted tub and the drum, which is disposed in the tub. With the drum washing machine, the clothes are neither damaged nor tangled with one another. Furthermore, the drum washing machine washes clothes by striking and rubbing the clothes, whereby washing efficiency is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a conventional drum washing machine, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view, in cross section, of the conventional drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the conventional drum washing machine comprises: a casing <b>2</b> forming the exterior of the drum washing machine; a tub <b>6</b> disposed in the casing <b>2</b> in such a manner that the tub <b>6</b> is suspended by means of springs <b>4</b> and simultaneously supported by means of damper assemblies <b>5</b>; a drum <b>8</b> rotatably mounted in the tub <b>6</b>, in which clothes are put and into which wash water is supplied; a plurality of vanes <b>8</b><i>a </i>provided on the inner circumference of the drum <b>8</b> for lifting the clothes in the drum <b>8</b> as the drum <b>8</b> is rotated, the vanes <b>8</b><i>a </i>being longitudinally extended parallel to the axis of rotation of the drum <b>8</b> and inwardly protruded to a predetermined height while the vanes <b>8</b><i>a </i>are uniformly spaced apart from each other; and a motor <b>10</b> connected to the drum <b>8</b> in the rear of the tub <b>6</b> for rotating the drum <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The drum washing machine further comprises: a water-supply valve assembly <b>12</b> mounted above the tub <b>6</b> for supplying wash water into the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b>; a detergent box assembly <b>14</b> also mounted above the tub <b>6</b> for supplying a detergent into the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b>; and a drainage pump assembly <b>16</b> mounted below the tub <b>6</b> for draining the wash water from the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The drum <b>8</b> is provided at the inner circumference thereof with a plurality of through-holes <b>8</b><i>h</i>, through which the wash water flows between the drum <b>8</b> and the tub <b>6</b>. When the drum <b>8</b> is rotated to dewater the clothes, the wash water contained in the clothes is separated from the clothes by means of the centrifugal force of the drum <b>8</b>. At this time, the wash water separated from the clothes is discharged through the through-holes <b>8</b><i>h</i>. The water-supply valve assembly <b>12</b> includes a water-supply valve (not shown) so that the water-supply valve assembly <b>12</b> supplies wash water into the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b> when the water-supply valve is opened. Similarly, the drainage pump assembly <b>16</b> includes a drainage pump (not shown) so that the drainage pump assembly <b>16</b> discharges the wash water from the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b> when the drainage pump is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To the lower part of the tub <b>6</b> is mounted a heater <b>20</b> for heating wash water in the tub <b>6</b> to a high temperature, by which the washing efficiency is improved. Specifically, the tub <b>6</b> includes a heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>formed at the lower part thereof. The heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b> is downwardly extended from the tub <b>6</b> so that the heater <b>20</b> is mounted in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The heater <b>20</b> is slidably inserted into the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b> from the front part thereof, and then securely fixed to the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The operation of the conventional drum washing machine with the above-stated construction will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When a washing process is performed while clothes are put in the drum <b>8</b>, the water-supply valve is opened so that a proper amount of wash water is supplied into the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b> depending upon the amount of the clothes. The wash water passes through the water-supply valve assembly <b>12</b>, and then passes through the detergent box assembly <b>14</b>. The wash water having passed through the detergent box assembly <b>14</b> is supplied into the tub <b>6</b> together with a detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the drum <b>8</b> is rotated by operation of the motor <b>10</b>, the clothes are lifted to a predetermined height by the vanes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and then dropped from the vanes <b>8</b><i>a </i>so that the clothes can be washed by means of friction and impact. At this time, the heater <b>20</b> may be operated to heat the wash water in the tub <b>6</b> so that the washing efficiency is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">After the washing process is finished, the drainage pump is operated so that the wash water is discharged. Subsequently, the motor <b>10</b> is rotated at a high speed, and thus the drum <b>8</b> is also rotated at a high speed. When the drum <b>8</b> is rotated, the wash water contained in the clothes is separated from the clothes by means of the centrifugal force of the drum <b>8</b>. At this time, the wash water separated from the clothes is discharged through the through-holes <b>8</b><i>h</i>. In this way, an intermittent dewatering process is performed. Thereafter, the water-supply valve is opened again so that wash water is supplied into the tub <b>6</b> and the drum <b>8</b>. At the same time, the drum <b>8</b> is rotated so that a rinsing process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aforementioned rinsing and intermittent dewatering processes are alternately and repeatedly carried out, and finally a dewatering process is performed. In this way, a cleaning process comprising washing, rinsing, and dewatering processes is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the conventional drum washing machine, however, the wash water is supplied into the tub <b>6</b> from the upper part thereof together with the detergent via the water-supply valve assembly <b>12</b> and the detergent box assembly <b>14</b>, and the wash water supplied into the tub <b>6</b> is heated by the heater <b>20</b> mounted to the lower part of the tub <b>6</b>. As can be easily understood from the above description, the wash water initially supplied into the tub is cold. Consequently, the wash water is slowly absorbed by the clothes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The conventional drum washing machine includes the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b>, which is provided so that the heater <b>20</b> is mounted in the tub <b>6</b>. The heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>is formed at the lower part of the tub <b>6</b> in such a manner that the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>is downwardly extended from the tub <b>6</b>. Consequently, it is required to provide an additional space necessary for forming the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>in the tub <b>6</b>, which complicates construction of the drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The wash water supplied in the tub <b>6</b> is heated by the heater <b>20</b>. Since the heater <b>20</b> is mounted in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b>, the wash water is also filled in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b>, and thus the wash water filled in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b> is also heated. However, the wash water filled in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b> is not used to wash the clothes. Consequently, wash water and electric energy are uselessly wasted. In addition, the detergent is left with the wash water in the heater mounting part <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the tub <b>6</b>, by which the washing efficiency of the drum washing machine is decreased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a steam jet drum washing machine which is capable of heating wash water and spraying the heated wash water into a tub and a drum of the washing machine in a phase of high-temperature and high-pressure steam, thereby rapidly soaking clothes in the wash water, reducing waste of the wash water and electric energy, and improving sterilizing and washing efficiencies of the drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a steam jet drum washing machine comprising: a tub disposed in a casing and adapted so that wash water is supplied into the tub; a drum rotatably mounted in the tub and adapted so that clothes are put in the drum and the wash water is supplied into the drum; a water-supply unit disposed at one side of the tub for supplying the wash water into the tub and the drum; and a steam generator connected to the water-supply unit for heating the wash water to obtain high-temperature and high-pressure steam, and supplying the high-temperature and high-pressure steam into the tub and the drum.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The end <b>62</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; of the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>is formed in the shape of a nozzle so that steam is sprayed at a high speed from the end <b>62</b><i>d&#x2032;</i>. The end <b>62</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; of the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>penetrates through the upper end of a gasket <b>57</b>, which is made of rubber, for preventing leakage of water between the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b>. Consequently, the steam guided along the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>is downwardly sprayed through the end <b>62</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; of the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c </i>and the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>are relatively short by the provision of the steam generator <b>70</b>. The steam generator <b>70</b> is disposed above the tub <b>56</b> between the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b> so that repair and inspection of the stem generator <b>70</b> can be easily and conveniently conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the steam generator <b>70</b> comprises: an airtight pressure container <b>72</b> connected at the top end thereof to the water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c </i>and the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>and having an inner space for storing wash water defined therein; a heater <b>74</b> mounted in the pressure container <b>72</b> for heating the wash water stored in the pressure container <b>72</b>; an inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>disposed between the water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c </i>and the pressure container <b>72</b> for supplying the wash water into the pressure container <b>72</b>; and an outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>disposed between the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>and the pressure container <b>72</b> for supplying steam into the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The pressure container <b>72</b> comprises an upper container part <b>72</b><i>a </i>forming the upper part of the pressure container <b>72</b>, and a lower container part <b>72</b><i>b </i>forming the lower part of the pressure container <b>72</b>. The upper container part <b>72</b><i>a </i>and the lower container part <b>72</b><i>b </i>are preferably attached to each other by means of bolts (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>are pressure valves that can be opened or closed depending upon the pressure inside the pressure container <b>72</b>. The inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>may be controlled either electrically or mechanically so that the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>is opened when the pressure inside the pressure container <b>72</b> is below a predetermined pressure. Similarly, the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>may be controlled either electrically or mechanically so that the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>is opened when the pressure inside the pressure container <b>72</b> is over a predetermined pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The steam generator <b>70</b> further comprises: a water level sensor <b>77</b> disposed at the upper part of the pressure container <b>72</b> for sensing the amount of the wash water stored in the pressure container <b>72</b> to control the operation of the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b</i>; and a temperature sensor <b>78</b> disposed at the lower part of the pressure container <b>72</b> for sensing the temperature inside the pressure container <b>72</b> to control the operation of the heater <b>74</b> on the basis of the temperature inside the pressure container <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The water level sensor <b>77</b> senses the level of the wash water on the basis of the movement of a float on the wash water. Alternatively, the water level sensor <b>77</b> may sense the level of the wash water on the basis of the change in inside pressure of the pressure container <b>72</b> when the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The heater <b>74</b> is horizontally disposed in the lower container part <b>72</b><i>b </i>so that heater <b>74</b> can be submerged under the wash water even when the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b> to the minimum water level.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The heater <b>74</b> is preferably formed in the shape of a curved pipe so that the heating surface area is increased. The heater <b>74</b> may be overheated while the heater <b>74</b> is energized. Consequently, there is preferably provided a safety unit for preventing overheating of the heater <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The safety unit comprises: an automatic pressure switch <b>79</b><i>a </i>disposed by the side of the water level sensor <b>77</b> for cutting off the supply of electric current to the heater <b>74</b> to primarily stop the operation of the heater <b>74</b> when the pressure inside the pressure container <b>72</b> is over a predetermined pressure; and an automatic temperature switch <b>79</b><i>b</i>, such as a thermostat, disposed by the side of the temperature sensor <b>78</b> for cutting off the supply of electric current to the heater <b>74</b> to secondarily stop the operation of the heater <b>74</b> when the temperature inside the pressure container <b>72</b> is over a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additional automatic temperature switches <b>79</b><i>b </i>may be disposed for preventing overheating of the heater <b>74</b> when the automatic pressure switch <b>79</b><i>a </i>is not normally operated or when the pressure container <b>72</b> leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The steam generator <b>70</b> further comprises a thermal insulator <b>75</b>, such as Styrofoam, for shielding the pressure container <b>72</b> to prevent thermal energy generated in the pressure container <b>72</b> from leaking out of the pressure container <b>72</b> when the heater <b>74</b> is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the steam generator <b>70</b> with the above-stated construction, the operation of the heater <b>74</b>, the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a</i>, and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>are controlled by a controller <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for controlling the operation of the drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of a steam jet drum washing machine according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The steam jet drum washing machine according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention is identical to the steam jet drum washing machine according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention except that the steam generator <b>70</b> is disposed below the tub <b>56</b> between the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Consequently, the water-supply tube <b>63</b><i>c </i>connected between the steam generator <b>70</b> and the water-supply valve assembly (not shown) is disposed between one side of the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b>. Similarly, the steam tube <b>63</b><i>d </i>connected between the steam generator <b>70</b> and the tub <b>56</b> is disposed between one side of the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the steam generator <b>70</b> is disposed below the tub <b>56</b> as described above, an empty space defined below the tub <b>56</b> between the tub <b>56</b> and the casing <b>52</b> may be used as the installation space for the steam generator <b>70</b>. Consequently, the total size of the drum washing machine is not increased even though the steam generator <b>70</b> is mounted in the drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The operation of the steam jet drum washing machine with the above-stated construction according to the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When a washing process is performed while clothes are put in the drum <b>58</b>, the water-supply valve is opened so that a proper amount of wash water is supplied into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b> depending upon the amount of the clothes. The wash water passes through the auxiliary water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, and then passes through the detergent box assembly <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The wash water having passed through the detergent box assembly <b>62</b><i>b </i>is supplied into the tub <b>56</b> together with a detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the wash water is to be sprayed in a phase of steam according to a user's selection, the wash water passes through the water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c</i>, and is then supplied into the steam generator <b>70</b> where the wash water is heated to obtain high-temperature and high-pressure steam. The high-temperature and high-pressure steam generated in the steam generator <b>70</b> is sprayed into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b> via the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Specifically, when the water-supply valve is opened so that the wash water is supplied via the water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c</i>, the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b> while the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>are opened. As the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b>, the water level sensor <b>77</b> senses the level of the wash water in the pressure container <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At this time, the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>is opened so that the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b>, and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>is opened so that air is discharged from the pressure container <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When a proper amount of the wash water is supplied into the pressure container <b>72</b>, the inlet valve <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>are closed, and simultaneously the heater <b>74</b> is operated to heat the wash water so that high-temperature and high-pressure steam is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Since the heater <b>74</b> is operated in the airtight space in the pressure container <b>72</b>, higher-temperature and higher-pressure steam may be generated as the heater <b>74</b> is operated for a longer time.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At this time, the temperature sensor <b>78</b> senses the temperature of the interior of the pressure container <b>72</b>, and the operation of the heater <b>74</b> is controlled on the basis of the sensed temperature so that the heater <b>74</b> is not overheated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the temperature sensor <b>78</b> is out of order or abnormally operated, the automatic pressure switch <b>79</b><i>a </i>and the automatic temperature switch <b>79</b><i>b </i>are operated to cut off the supply of electric current to the heater <b>74</b> so that overheating of the heater <b>74</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the heater <b>74</b> is operated, the wash water supplied into the airtight pressure container <b>72</b> is heated to generate high-temperature and high-pressure steam. When the temperature sensor <b>78</b> senses that the temperature of the interior of the pressure container <b>72</b> is over a predetermined pressure, the outlet valve <b>76</b><i>b </i>is opened so that the steam passes through the steam tube <b>62</b><i>d </i>and is then sprayed into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At this time, the steam is sprayed into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b> through the end <b>62</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; of the steam tube, which is formed in the shape of a nozzle. As a result, the clothes are rapidly soaked.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When a proper amount of the wash water is supplied into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b>, the water-supply valve is closed, and the motor <b>60</b> is operated. When the drum <b>58</b> is rotated by operation of the motor <b>60</b>, the clothes are lifted to a predetermined height by the vanes <b>58</b><i>a </i>and then dropped from the vanes <b>58</b><i>a</i>. In this way, a washing process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After the washing process is finished, the drainage pump is operated so that the wash water is discharged. Subsequently, the motor <b>60</b> is rotated at a high speed, and thus the drum <b>58</b> is also rotated at a high speed. When the drum <b>58</b> is rotated, the wash water contained in the clothes is separated from the clothes by means of the centrifugal force of the drum <b>58</b>. In this way, an intermittent dewatering process is performed. The water-supply valve is opened again so that wash water is supplied into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b> to a predetermined level via the auxiliary water-supply tube <b>62</b><i>c&#x2032;</i>. Thereafter, the drum <b>58</b> is rotated so that a rinsing process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The aforementioned rinsing and intermittent dewatering processes are alternately and repeatedly carried out, and finally a dewatering process is performed. In this way, a process for cleaning the clothes is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be noted that the wash water may be supplied into the steam generator <b>70</b> where the wash water is heated to obtain high-temperature and high-pressure steam, and the high-temperature and high-pressure steam may be sprayed into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b> even when the clothes are washed or rinsed as well as when the wash water is initially supplied into the tub <b>56</b> and the drum <b>58</b>, in order to improve sterilizing and washing efficiencies of the drum washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a steam jet drum washing machine characterized in that wash water is supplied into a steam generator where the wash water is heated to obtain high-temperature and high-pressure steam, and the steam is sprayed into a tub and a drum of the drum washing machine, thereby rapidly soaking clothes in the wash water when the wash water is initially supplied into the tub and the drum, saving wash water and electric energy. Furthermore, the wash water is supplied in a phase of high-temperature and high-pressure steam when clothes are washed and rinsed, whereby sterilizing and washing efficiencies of the drum washing machine are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
