<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to composite fibers having a crimping property whereby humidity produces significant variation in the percentage of crimp in a reversible manner. More specifically, the invention relates to composite fibers which can be used to produce fabrics which maintain and exhibit excellent percentage of crimp variation properties even after the processes of dyeing and finishing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known in the prior art that natural fibers of cotton, wool and feathers can undergo reversible variation in form and percentage of crimp in response to changes in humidity. It has long been attempted to impart such function to synthetic fibers, and for example, Patent documents 1 and 2 have proposed forming side-by-side composite fibers using nylon-6 and polyethylene terephthalate. However, these composite fibers have not been actually employed because of the minimal reversible variation in the percentage of crimp in response to changes in humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent documents 3 and 4 later proposed improvements in the heat treatment conditions. Also, Patent documents 5-8 proposed applications of this prior art. However, a practical level of use has not been achieved because of the small degree of variation in percentage of crimp which results after steps such as dyeing and finishing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, Patent document 9 attempts to overcome the problem described above by forming a polyester component and a polyamide component into a flat form and bonding them, in a side-by-side fashion, using a highly hygroscopic polyamide such as nylon-4 as the polyamide component but, because of the poor reeling stability of nylon-4 and reduced crimping performance resulting from heat treatment, there has been a limit to the practicality of even this type of composite fiber.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the invention, it is possible to provide composite fibers which undergo significant variation in the percentage of crimp in a reversible manner in response to humidity, due to the crimp expressed after boiling water treatment or the like, and the composite fibers can produce very comfortable fabrics with no stuffy feeling. In particular, while conventional composite fibers undergo notable reduction in percentage of crimp variation after the dyeing and finishing steps, the composite fibers of the present invention maintain their variation in percentage of crimp even after those steps, and therefore are highly practical and exhibit an effect which can result in a high level of comfort in final products such as clothing which has not been achievable in the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The polyester component used to compose a moisture responsive composite fiber of the invention may be polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate or the like, among which polyethylene terephthalate is preferred from the standpoint of cost and general utility.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the invention, the polyester component is preferably a modified polyester obtained by copolymerization with 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid. If the 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid is copolymerized in a very large amount, separation is prevented at the bonding interface between the polyamide component and polyester component, but it becomes difficult to achieve an excellent crimping performance. Conversely, if the copolymerization amount is very small, crystallization is promoted and it is easier to achieve excellent crimping performance, but separation at the bonding interface between the polyamide component and polyester component is promoted. Consequently, the amount of copolymerized 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid is preferably 2.0-4.5 molar percent and more preferably 2.3-3.5 molar percent.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the intrinsic viscosity of the polyester component is too low, crystallization is promoted resulting in more excellent crimping performance, but the reeling property is reduced and fluff tends to be produced, which is unfavorable in terms of industrial production and quality. Conversely, if the intrinsic viscosity is too high, crystallization is inhibited making it difficult to achieve excellent crimping performance, while the thickening effect of the 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid copolymerizing component excessively increases the melt viscosity during spinning, thereby lowering the spinning property and ductility, and tending to produce fluff and yarn breakage. Thus, the intrinsic viscosity of the polyester component is preferably 0.30-0.43 and more preferably 0.35-0.41.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the other hand, the polyamide component is not particularly restricted so long as it has an amide bond in the main chain, and as examples there may be mentioned nylon-4, nylon-6, nylon-66, nylon-46 and nylon-12, among which nylon-6 and nylon-66 are particularly preferred from the viewpoint of reeling stability and general utility. Other components may also be copolymerized with such polyamide components as bases.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Both the polyester and polyamide components described above may contain pigments such as titanium oxide and carbon black, or publicly known antioxidants, antistatic agents-and light-fast agents.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The composite fibers of the invention comprise a polyester component and a polyamide component bound in a side-by-side or eccentric core-in-sheath structure. The composited form of the polyamide component and polyester component is preferably such that both components are bonded in a side-by-side fashion from the viewpoint of crimp expression. The cross-sectional shape of the composite fibers may be a circular cross-section or a non-circular cross-section, and in the case of a non-circular cross-section there may be employed, for example, a triangular or square cross-section. A hollow section may also be present in the cross-section of the composite fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The proportion of the polyester component and the polyamide component in the lateral cross-section of the fiber is preferably a ratio of polyester component/polyamide component=30/70 to 70/30 and more preferably 60/40 to 40/60, based on the weight ratio of both components. When the composite fibers of the invention have an eccentric core-in-sheath structure, the core section may be either the polyester component or the polyamide component. The core section in this case is situated eccentrically in the sheath section.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the invention, it is important to simultaneously satisfy the conditions for the percentage of crimp DC after the composite fibers are treated in boiling water for 30 minutes under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex, and then dry heat treated for 30 minutes at 100&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex for stabilization of the crimps and further dry heat treated for one minute at 160&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex, and for the percentage of crimp HC after the crimped composite fibers are immersed in water at 20-30&#xb0; C. for 10 hours, as well as the difference between these crimp percentages &#x394;C. Research by the present inventors has led to the discovery that composite fibers having such crimp properties have improved air permeability after moisture absorption, and exhibit no reduction in these properties even after steps such as dyeing and finishing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Specifically, the percentage of crimp DC must be 1.3-15.0%, preferably 2.0-10.0% and more preferably 2.5-8.0%. If the percentage of crimp DC is too small, the percentage of crimp HC after immersion in water is larger and may result in plugging of the fabric by moisture absorption when the fibers are used to produce a fabric, such that the air permeability is reduced by moisture absorption. On the other hand, while a larger percentage of crimp DC is basically favorable, it must be suitably restricted because of the limit to permanent setting of crimps by humidity. If the percentage of crimp DC is too large, the percentage of crimp HC after immersion in water will also tend to increase, thus limiting the improvement in air permeability of fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The percentage of crimp HC after immersion in water must be 0.5-10.0%, preferably 0.5-5.0% and more preferably 0.5-3.0%. The percentage of crimp HC is preferably closer to 0 from the viewpoint of variation in air permeability, but when it is reduced to below 0.5% the percentage of crimp DC must also be reduced, and if the conditions are not precisely set the fabric will tend to have increased permeability due to moisture absorption and quality control from an industrial standpoint will be greatly hampered. On the other hand, a percentage of crimp exceeding 10.0% will result in crimping even with moisture absorption, making it difficult to obtain a fabric with excellent air permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, the difference &#x394;C between the percentage of crimp DC and the percentage of crimp HC represented by the equation: &#x394;C(%)=DC(%)&#x2212;HC(%) must be 0.5-7.0%, preferably 1.0-5.5% and more preferably 1.5-5.0%. If &#x394;C is less than 0.5%, the variation in air permeability of the fabric from a dry state to a moisture-absorbed state will be minimal. However, although a larger &#x394;C is preferred, if it exceeds 7.0% the percentage of crimp DC itself will increase, resulting also in a higher percentage of crimp HC, thus making it difficult to obtain a fabric with significantly improved air permeability due to moisture absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For production of composite fibers of the invention having the crimp properties described above, it is preferred to employ a modified polyester wherein the polyester component is 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.30-0.43 copolymerized at 2.0-4.5 mole percent based on the acid component, and this can be easily achieved by designing the fiber structure to produce a specific range for the mechanical properties of the composite fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">That is, the 10% elongation stress of the composite fibers is preferably 1.6-3.5 cN/dtex, more preferably 1.8-3.0 cN/dtex and even more preferably 2.0-2.8 cN/dtex. If the stress under 10% elongation is less than 1.6 cN/dtex, it becomes difficult to obtain composite fibers having firm crimping performance, the percentage of crimp DC is lowered, and the air permeability of fabrics with moisture absorption tends to be lower. On the other hand, if the stress under 10% elongation is greater than 3.5 cN/dtex the percentage of crimp DC becomes too large, which also results in a larger percentage of crimp HC after water immersion and tends to lower the air permeability of the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, the strength of the composite fibers is preferably 3.0-4.7 cN/dtex, more preferably 3.3-4.3 cN/dtex and even more preferably 3.4-4.0 cN/dtex. If the strength is less than 3.0 cN/dtex, an insufficient stretching effect is produced during formation of the fibers, tending to result in a lower percentage of crimp DC upon drying and reduced air permeability of the fabric due to moisture absorption. On the other hand, a strength exceeding 4.7 cN/dtex will tend to result in an excessively large percentage of crimp DC, simultaneously increasing the percentage of crimp HC after water immersion and lowering the air permeability of the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The overall size of the composite fibers of the invention is 40-200 dtex for use as an ordinary clothing material, and the single filament size may be 1-6 dtex. Entangling may also be carried out if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For production of composite fibers having a cross-sectional shape according to the invention as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-144518, for example, there may be used a spinneret having separate discharge holes for the high-viscosity component and the low-viscosity component and a lower linear discharge speed (a larger discharge surface area) for the high-viscosity component, running a molten polyester through the high-viscosity discharge hole and a molten polyamide through the low-viscosity discharge hole, whereby they are bonded together and then cooled to solidification. Stretching of the spun yarn which has been taken up may be accomplished using either a method of stretching after wind-up, if necessary with separate stretching involving heat treatment, or a method of stretching without winding up, if necessary with direct stretching involving heat treatment. The spinning speed employed is preferably 1000-3500 m/min. Also, for stretching and heat setting by a direct stretching method with a stretching machine equipped with two rollers, for example, the first roller may be used to preheat the yarn at 50-100&#xb0; C. and then the second roller used for heat setting at 145-170&#xb0; C. The stretching factor between the first and second rollers is preferably 2.75-4.0. By adjusting the heat setting temperature and stretching factor (through adjustment of the second roller stretching speed, for example) as mentioned above, it is possible to adjust the tensile strength to 3.0-4.7 cN/dtex, the 10% elongation tensile stress to 1.6-3.5 cN/dtex and the breaking elongation to 15-50%. In consideration of the handleability and use as combined filament yarn as described hereunder, the boiling water shrinkage is preferably 6-18% and more preferably 6-15%.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finishing of the fabric requires a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. or higher and a binding force for setting. Specifically, moist heat at 120&#xb0; C. is applied for dyeing while dry heat at 160&#xb0; C. and tension are applied for setting, and therefore the crimping performance must be able to withstand these conditions. According to prior art technology, crimps become extended under the binding force at 120&#xb0; C. or 160&#xb0; C., such that adequate performance is no longer exhibited. It was discovered that the property of the original yarn needed to overcome this to achieve the desired performance is the ability to maintain crimping performance even after heat treatment under the applied load. First, boiling water treatment is carried out for 3 minutes under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex. As the polyamide component has a higher shrinkage than the polyester component, crimping is generated with the polyamide component situated inwardly. During this time, the presence of moisture extends the polyamide component, as a result of moisture absorption, and reduces the crimping as time progresses. In order to prevent this, dry heat treatment is carried out for 30 minutes at 100&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex, to remove the moisture and stabilize the crimps in a dry state. Next, dry heat treatment is carried out for 1 minute at 160&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex in order to confirm maintenance of crimping even under setting at 160&#xb0; C., and this confirmation of the presence of crimps even under high temperature and binding force is essential for the crimping performance. Incidentally, although NY extends within a relatively short time when immersed in water, an immersion time of 10 hours is sufficient from the viewpoint of stable equilibrium, and the temperature of the water is preferably a temperature of 20-30&#xb0; C. which is below the glass transition temperature of NY (below 35&#xb0; C.). Crimping performance which is maintained even under such harsh conditions can result in the desired performance even after actual fabric finishing steps. For these reasons, the composite fibers of the invention have a notably reduced stuffy feeling compared to prior art composite fibers even after such heat treatment in finishing steps, and can therefore provide highly superior fabrics in practical terms.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The composite fibers of the invention may of course be used alone, but they may also be used as a combined filament yarn in combination with other fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the composite fiber of the invention may be used in combined filament yarn in combination with low-shrinkage fiber having a lower boiling water shrinkage and preferably a boiling water shrinkage of less than 5% and more preferably less than 4%, preferably with the higher-shrinkage composite fiber situated as the core. Alternatively, the composite fiber of the invention may be used in a combined filament yarn in combination with high shrinkage fiber having a higher boiling water shrinkage and preferably a boiling water shrinkage of 18% or greater and more preferably 20% or greater, preferably with the lower-shrinkage composite fiber used as the sheath. Such combined filament yarn has a satisfactory bulky feel, exhibiting excellent sensation and function.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As examples of fibers with lower shrinkage than the aforementioned composite fiber there may be mentioned fibers obtained using polyester, and especially polyethylene terephthalate, for melt spinning and spin drawing to achieve low shrinkage, and specifically there are preferred fibers with a shrinkage of less than 5% obtained by relaxed heat treatment of an undrawn filament (or, &#x201c;POY&#x201d;) wound up at a spinning speed of 2800-3500 m/min.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, as examples of fibers with higher shrinkage than the aforementioned composite fiber there may be mentioned fibers made of polyester, and especially polyethylene terephthalate, which have high shrinkage by copolymerization with isophthalic acid or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The aforementioned combined filament yarn may be produced by combined entangling of a composite fiber of the invention with a fiber having a higher shrinkage or a fiber having a lower shrinkage. No special equipment is necessary for the combined entangling treatment, and a publicly known method of entangling by air may be employed. The number of tangles in the combined filament yarn is preferably 10-80/m.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The composite fiber of the invention may, if necessary, be further subjected to false twisting for used as false twisted yarn. Preferably, the fibers in the false twisted yarn exhibit a percentage of crimp TDC of 10-30% after the false twisted yarn is treated in boiling water for 30 minutes under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex, and then dry heat treated for 30 minutes at 100&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex for stabilization of the crimps and further dry heat treated for one minute at 160&#xb0; C. under a load of 1.76&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cN/dtex, while the fibers in the false twisted yarn exhibit a percentage of crimp THC of 5-17% after the crimped false twisted yarn is immersed in water at 20-30&#xb0; C. for 10 hours, and the difference in the percentage of crimps &#x394;TC represented by (TDC(%)&#x2212;THC(%)) is 3-15%.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the percentage of crimp TDC is less than 10%, the crimp value of the fibers in the false twisted yarn is too small, and therefore textiles with excellent bulk cannot be obtained from such false twisted yarn. On the other hand, while a percentage of crimp TDC of greater than 30% may be desirable in terms of bulk, the increase in percentage of crimp causes the crimping conditions to become similar to false twisting conditions which produce a twisting effect, and the result is separation at the interface between the polyamide component and polyester component. The percentage of crimp TDC is more preferably 15-25% and even more preferably 18-23%.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The percentage of crimp THC is preferably closer to 0 for improved air permeability, but for false twisted yarn the percentage of crimp itself must be increased to increase the bulk. If the percentage of crimp THC is controlled to less than 5%, the percentage of crimp TDC will also have to be reduced, making it impossible to obtain a textile with excellent bulk. On the other hand, if the percentage of crimp TDH is greater than 17%, it will be difficult to obtain a textile with excellent air permeability under humid conditions because crimping will remain even with moisture absorption. The percentage of crimp THC after water immersion is more preferably 6-15% and even more preferably 7-13%.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also, the difference &#x394;TC between the percentage of crimp TDC and the percentage of crimp THC is preferably not less than 3% because variation in the air permeability of the textile will be reduced when the environment changes from a dry state to a moist state. &#x394;TC is preferably as large as possible, but if it exceeds 15% the percentage of crimp TDC itself will increase resulting in a higher percentage of crimp THC as well, and making it difficult to obtain a textile with significantly improved air permeability due to moisture absorption. &#x394;TC is more preferably 5-12% and even more preferably 6-11%.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to obtain high crimping properties for the aforementioned false twisted yarn, it is preferred to sufficiently increase the orientation for high-strength false twisted yarn. Specifically, the tensile strength of the false twisted yarn is 2.2-3.6 cN/dtex, preferably 2.4-3.4 cN/dtex and more preferably 2.5-3.2 cN/dtex. If the tensile strength is less than 2.2 cN/dtex, the stretching effect during formation of the fibers will be inadequate, resulting in a percentage of crimp (DC) of less than 10% and preventing production of a fabric with excellent bulk. On the other hand, if the tensile strength is greater than 3.6 cN/dtex, yarn breakage may become more frequent during the draw-hot treatment step or false twisting step.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The false twisted yarn described above may be produced by false twisting composite fibers spun by the method explained above. The method of false twisting is preferably a method for high-strength-type false twisted yarn, and an outdraw method is preferred wherein a filament with sufficiently increased strength by stretching is produced and then subjected to false twisting. As regards the twisting apparatus used for the false twisting, a disk-type or belt-type friction twisting apparatus will facilitate threading, but it may also be a pin-type twisting apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The number of false twists is represented by the following formula: Number of twists (T/m)=34000/&#x221a;(Dtex&#xd7;1.11)&#xd7;&#x3b1;, wherein &#x3b1; is preferably 0.7-1.1 and normally a value of 0.9. Also, the temperature for the false twisting will basically differ depending on the apparatus used and may be optimized from the standpoint of crimping performance and yarn breakage during the false twisting step, but for a pin-type twisting apparatus it is preferably 120-200&#xb0; C., more preferably 140-180&#xb0; C. and even more preferably 145-175&#xb0; C., in order to allow stable production of false twisted yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The composite fibers, combined filament yarn and false twisted yarn of the invention may be used for various purposes for clothing, and for example, they are particularly preferred for purposes which demand comfort, such as sportswear, inner materials, uniforms and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Combinations of the composite fibers with natural fibers can exhibit additional effects, and for example, combination with urethane or polytrimethylene terephthalate may be employed to further impart stretch properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0116">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a composite fiber, which expresses crimping upon boiling water treatment, wherein humidity produces reversible variation in the percentage of crimp. The composite fibers of the invention can yield highly comfortable fabrics with no stuffy feeling. Notably, while conventional composite fibers have considerably reduced variation in percentage of crimp after the processes of dyeing and finishing, the composite fiber of the invention maintains high percentage of crimp variation properties even after such processes and is highly practical, exhibiting a high level of comfort in final products such as clothing which has not been achieved in the prior art and, therefore, its industrial value is very high.</p>
