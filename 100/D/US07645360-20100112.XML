<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of PCT Appln. No. PCT/EP2006/004948 filed May 24, 2006 which claims priority to German application DE 10 2005 025 450.0 filed Jun. 2, 2005.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to defoamer formulations comprising (A) siloxane-based antifoams and (B) polysiloxane copolymers, and also to their application to the defoaming of aqueous media, particularly aqueous media obtained in pulp production.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many liquid systems, especially aqueous systems, which include surface-active compounds purposefully or as unwanted constituents, it is possible for problems to occur as a result of foaming if these systems are contacted more or less intensively with gaseous substances, such as during the gassing of waste waters, during the intensive stirring of liquids, during distillation, washing or coloring operations or during dispensing processes, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This foam can be controlled by mechanical means or through the addition of defoamers. Siloxane-based defoamers have proven particularly appropriate here.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Siloxane-based defoamers are prepared in accordance with DD-A 056 762, for example, by heating hydrophilic silica in polydimethylsiloxanes. This process is very costly and inconvenient, and in spite of this, the activity of the defoamers thus prepared is unsatisfactory. The dispersion of hydrophobized silica in a polydimethylsiloxane, in accordance for example with DE A 29 25 722, is a more rational process, but again the activity of the resulting defoamers is capable of improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Likewise known is the use of modified polyorganosiloxanes in defoamer preparations. Thus, for example, the use of branched siloxane defoamers in combination with polyether-polysiloxane copolymers is recommended as defoamers, for example, for pulp production (EP-A 341 952). In combination with mineral oils as a carrier oil, as well, polyether-polysiloxane copolymers are said to have a positive effect (U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,019). According to WO 98/000216, siloxanes having dimethyl-3-hydroxypropylpolyoxyethylenepolyoxy-propylene groups are particularly suitable surfactants in defoamer formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP-A 633 225 and EP-A 1076073 claim crosslinked or branched polyorganosiloxanes, respectively, which carry at least one polyether moiety, as one of the two components of a defoamer formulation. The crosslinking in these cases is via alkylene groups, via poly-dimethylsiloxanes or via polyether groups. As a result of the Si&#x2014;C linkage, the products are stable to hydrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In contrast to this, the process proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,024 also leads to Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;C-group linkages, which particularly in acidic or basic media are not stable to hydrolysis and therefore lose their activity in foaming aqueous medium.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">DE 102 55 649 &#x212b; describes defoamer formulations in which specially branched polyether-polysiloxane copolymers are added to known antifoam compositions. In the presence of water, however, defoamer formulations of this kind become less active.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The defoamer formulations prepared in accordance with the prior art either do not always have adequate activity or are not stable to hydrolysis.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It was an object of the invention, therefore, to avoid the disadvantages specified above and to provide siloxane-based defoamer formulations which exhibit an improved activity particularly in highly foaming, hot, alkaline media which are obtained, for example, in pulp production. These and other objects are achieved by defoamer compositions containing a siloxane-based antifoam and coupling a polysiloxane bearing active-hydrogen-containing hydrophilic polymer moieties by means of a di- or polyisocyanate.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0094">Branched viscoelastic polyorganosiloxanes of this kind can be obtained, for example, by reacting the product of dimethyldichlorosilane hydrolysis or by reacting hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes with a trimethylsilyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane and with a compound selected from a silyl having at least three hydrolyzable groups, such as tetraethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane or methyltriacetoxysilane, or with a silicone resin which is constructed substantially of (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2 </sub>and SiO<sub>2 </sub>units in a ratio of 2:1 to 1:2, in the presence of a catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095">A further variant for the preparation of branched viscoelastic polyorganosiloxanes is the reaction of an organosiloxane X<sup>1 </sup>having on average less than 2, randomly distributed functional groups per molecule with an organosiloxane X<sup>2 </sup>having on average more than 2, randomly distributed functional groups per molecule, there being only one kind of functional groups per siloxane X<sup>1 </sup>or X<sup>2 </sup>in each case, in the presence of a catalyst that promotes hydrosilylations, such as platinum or platinum compounds, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0096">The siloxane-based antifoam may further contain 0.1% to 10% by weight, preferably 0.5% to 5% by weight, of at least one polyorganosiloxane (ab&#x2032;) of the general formula (XIV), in which R<sup>8 </sup>denotes a methyl radical and R<sup>9 </sup>denotes a linear and/or branched hydrocarbon radical having at least 6 carbon atoms, d adopts a value of 0.005 to 0.5, and the sum (d+e) adopts a value of 1.9 to 2.1. Products of this kind are accessible, for example, through alkali-catalyzed condensation of silanol-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes with a viscosity of 50 to 50,000 mPa&#xb7;s at 25&#xb0; C. and aliphatic alcohols having more than 6 carbon atoms, such as isotridecyl alcohol, n-octanol, stearyl alcohol, 4-ethylhexadecanol or eicosanol.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0097">In the defoamer formulations of the invention there may be further known additions or auxiliaries present, examples being further fillers such as alumina, metal soaps, hydrophobized, finely ground quartz, or finely divided hydrophobic polyurethanes. Also possible, however, is the addition of substances which act as defoamer oils, such as mineral oils, liquid paraffins, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, and waxes, in amounts of 1% to 99% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation. In addition it is possible to add compounds known as thickeners, such as polyacrylic acid, polyacrylates, cellulose ethers such as carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose, natural gums such as xanthan gum, and polyurethanes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">The defoamer formulation of the invention is produced by known processes, as for example by employing high shearing forces in colloid mills or rotor-stator homogenizers. This mixing operation may take place under reduced pressure, in order to prevent air which is present in highly dispersed fillers being incorporated by mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">Preference is given to the use of the defoamer formulations of the invention in oil-in-water emulsions (O/W emulsions). The specific polysiloxane copolymers used in the defoamer formulations of the invention have surfactant properties, and are therefore also suitable for use as emulsifiers for the formation of oil-in-water emulsions, starting from antifoams based on siloxanes. The defoamer formulations, if used as emulsions, can further be admixed with additional organic emulsifiers which are able to form o/W emulsions on the basis of siloxanes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">The polysiloxane copolymers (B) can be emulsified together with the antifoam (A), or the polysiloxane copolymers (B) can simply be added, after the preparation of an emulsion from the antifoam (A) to the antifoam emulsion directly or in the form of an emulsion, in order to achieve an improved activity.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">The defoamer formulations of the invention in the form of O/W emulsions preferably contain</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(A) 5% to 50% by weight of siloxane-based antifoams,</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(B) 0.1% to 30% by weight of the polysiloxane copolymer of the invention,</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(C) 2% to 20% by weight of an emulsifier, and</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(D) 50% to 95% by weight of water, based in each case on the total weight of the defoamer formulations, and optionally</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(E) preservatives, thickeners, and further additives.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0102">The emulsifiers needed for the preparation of the emulsions may be anionic, cationic or nonionic and are known to the skilled worker for the purpose of preparing stable silicone emulsions. Preference is given to using emulsifier mixtures, which ought to contain at least one nonionic emulsifier, such as sorbitan fatty acid esters, ethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, ethoxylated fatty acids, ethoxylated linear or branched alcohols having 10 to 20 carbon atoms and/or glycerol esters, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0103">Technologies for the preparation of silicone emulsions are known. Typically the preparation takes place by the simple stirring together of all of the ingredients and their subsequent homogenization using rotor-stator homogenizers, colloid mills or high-pressure homogenizers.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104">The defoamer formulations of the invention can be employed wherever operations are subject to disruptive foaming which is to be lessened or eliminated completely. Such applications are, for example, in laundry and cleaning detergents, the control of foam in waste water plants, textile dye processes, in connection with the scrubbing of natural gas, in dispersions, and in hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0105">More particularly the defoamer formulations of the invention can be employed to outstanding effect for defoaming aqueous media that are obtained during pulp production.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0108">A2: 400 parts of a hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane with a viscosity of 65 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, 40 parts of trimethylsiloxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane with a viscosity of 40 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, 4 parts of methyltrimethoxysilane, and 1 part of a 0.5% phosphorus nitride chloride catalyst were heated to 100&#xb0; C. Over the course of 20 minutes the pressure was lowered to 35 mbar. Thereafter the catalyst was neutralized with 0.03 part of triisooctylamine. The polyorganosiloxane obtained had a viscosity of 19,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s.

The hydrosilylation is initiated by adding 0.5 ml of a 2% strength solution of hexachloroplatinic acid and isopropanol, and is manifested in a slightly exothermic reaction. The reaction mixture is held at 100-110&#xb0; C. until a clear copolymer is obtained and until active hydrogen is no longer detectable. The intermediate has a viscosity of 870 mm<sup>2</sup>/s (25&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0111">Heating takes place further to 130&#xb0; C., and traces of water are removed under reduced pressure. Thereafter 7 g of hexamethylene diisocyanate are metered in and the mixture is homogenized for 20 minutes. The isocyanate reaction is initiated with one drop of DBTL. After 2 hours the NCO content has fallen below the detection limit (IR: 20 ppm), and so 120 g of Emulan&#xae; HE 50 emulsifier (BASF) are metered in. The 80% strength copolymer solution has a viscosity after cooling to 25&#xb0; C. of 2100 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and a urethane content of 0.139 meq/g.</p>
