<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a composite tubing, more particularly to a composite tubing having an outer tubing and a fiber-based rope.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Materials for woven furniture and articles, e.g., chairs and seat cushions, include natural materials, e.g., rattan, and synthetic materials, e.g., plastics. The disadvantages of using rattan as a weaving material reside in high material cost, limited rattan resources, and relative discomfort due to the rigid property of rattan. Although plastics are relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain, they do not have sufficient durability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a composite tubing that can overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this invention, a composite tubing includes: an outer tubing which is prepared by seaming along a lengthwise direction two lateral sides of a lengthwise-extending strip made from a deformable material, the lateral sides being disposed opposite to each other in a transverse direction relative to the lengthwise direction, and being superimposed on each other so as to form a tubular body and a seamed ridge, the tubular body including a force-bearing-side half and a ridge-side half opposite to each other in the transverse direction and cooperating with each other to define a compressible tubular chamber, the seamed ridge extending from the ridge-side half radially and lengthwise to thereby render deformability of the ridge-side half less than that of the force-bearing-side half; and a fiber-based rope disposed to extend lengthwise in the compressible tubular chamber, and being of a dimension such that, when the force-bearing-side half is pressed and deformed, the fiber-based rope is shiftable against the ridge-side half so as to vest the tubular body with an increased strength while preserving the padding effect of the force-bearing-side half.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the preferred embodiment of a composite tubing <b>1</b> according to the present invention is shown to include a fiber-based rope <b>2</b> and an outer tubing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer tubing <b>3</b> is prepared by seaming along a lengthwise direction (X) two lateral sides <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of a lengthwise-extending strip. The lateral sides <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> are disposed opposite to each other in a transverse direction (Y) relative to the lengthwise direction (X), and are superimposed on each other so as to form a tubular body <b>31</b> and a seamed ridge <b>32</b>. The lengthwise-extending strip is made from a deformable material, e.g., a plastic material or artificial leather.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The tubular body <b>31</b> includes a force-bearing-side half <b>311</b> and a ridge-side half <b>312</b> opposite to each other in the transverse direction (Y) and cooperating with each other to define a compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b>. The seamed ridge <b>32</b> extends from the ridge-side half <b>312</b> radially and lengthwise to thereby render deformability of the ridge-side half <b>312</b> less than that of the force-bearing-side half <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fiber-based rope <b>2</b> is disposed to extend lengthwise in the compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b>. The fiber-based rope <b>2</b> is of a dimension such that, when the force-bearing-side half <b>311</b> is pressed and deformed, the fiber-based rope <b>2</b> is shiftable against the ridge-side half <b>312</b> so as to vest the tubular body <b>31</b> with an increased strength while preserving the padding effect of the force-bearing-side half <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Suitable materials for the fiber-based rope <b>2</b> include a natural fiber and a synthetic fiber. Examples of the natural fiber include hemp, linen, cotton, coir, jute, flax, and sisal. Examples of the synthetic fiber include polypropylene, nylon, polyester, and polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, preferably, the seamed ridge <b>32</b> radially extends from the ridge-side half <b>312</b> into the compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the composite tubings <b>1</b> according to this invention can be interlaced to form an article or an item of furniture having padding/cushioning effect. In particular, the force-bearing-side half <b>311</b> of the outer tubings <b>31</b> serve as a padding surface of the article. As described above, when the force-bearing-side half <b>311</b> are subjected to an external force (e.g., sitting force), the fiber-based rope <b>2</b> is shiftable against the ridge-side half <b>312</b> so as to vest the tubular body <b>31</b> with an increased strength. In addition, the space between the outer tubing <b>3</b> and the fiber-based rope <b>2</b> in the compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b> improves the softness for the padded article.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the structure of the composite tubing <b>1</b>, the seamed ridge <b>32</b> formed at the ridge-side half <b>312</b> and the fiber-based rope <b>2</b> disposed in the compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b> can provide superior tensile strength for the composite tubing <b>1</b>. In addition, the space in the compressible tubular chamber <b>36</b> improves the softness of the interlaced padded article.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretation and equivalent arrangements.</p>
