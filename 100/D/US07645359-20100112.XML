<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for making fibrous structures comprising cellulose fibers and synthetic fibers in combination, and more specifically to fibrous structures having cellulose fibers distributed generally randomly and synthetic fibers distributed in a non-random pattern.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fibrous structures, such as paper webs, are well known in the art and are in common use today for paper towels, toilet tissue, facial tissue, napkins, wet wipes, and the like. Typical tissue paper is comprised predominantly of cellulosic fibers, often wood-based. Despite a broad range of cellulosic fiber types, such fibers are generally high in dry modulus and relatively large in diameter, which may cause their flexural rigidity to be higher than desired. Further, wood fibers can have a relatively high stiffness when dry, which may negatively affect the softness of the product and may have low stiffness when wet, which may cause poor absorbency of the resulting product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To form a web, the fibers in typical disposable paper products are bonded to one another through chemical interaction and often the bonding is limited to the naturally occurring hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups on the cellulose molecules. If greater temporary or permanent wet strength is desired, strengthening additives can be used. These additives typically work by either covalently reacting with the cellulose or by forming protective molecular films around the existing hydrogen bonds. However, they can also produce relatively rigid and inelastic bonds, which may detrimentally affect softness and absorption properties of the products.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of synthetic fibers along with cellulose fibers can help overcome some of the previously mentioned limitations. Synthetic polymers can be formed into fibers with very small fiber diameters and are generally lower in modulus than cellulose. Thus, a fiber can be made with very low flexural rigidity, which facilitates good product softness. In addition, functional cross-sections of the synthetic fibers can be micro-engineered as desired. Synthetic fibers can also be designed to maintain modulus when wetted, and hence webs made with such fibers resist collapse during absorbency tasks. Accordingly, the use of thermally bonded synthetic fibers in tissue products can result in a strong network of highly flexible fibers (good for softness) joined with water-resistant high-stretch bonds (good for softness and wet strength). However, synthetic fibers can be relatively expensive as compared to cellulose fibers. Thus, it may be desired to include only as many synthetic fibers as are necessary to gain the desired benefits that the fibers provide.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, it would be advantageous to provide improved fibrous structures including cellulosic and synthetic fibers in combination, and processes for making such fibrous structures. It would also be advantageous to provide a product that has synthetic fibers concentrated in certain desired portions of the resulting web and a method to allow for such non-random placement of such fibers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To address the problems with respect to the prior art, certain methods are provided for making unitary fibrous structures including a plurality of synthetic fibers and a plurality of cellulosic fibers. The methods include providing a first aqueous slurry comprising a plurality of synthetic fibers and providing a second aqueous slurry comprising a plurality of cellulosic fibers. The methods also include depositing the first and second aqueous slurries onto a fluid-permeable forming member having a pattern of channels and partially dewatering the deposited first and second slurries to form a fibrous web comprising a plurality of cellulosic fibers randomly distributed throughout at least a portion of the fibrous web and a plurality of synthetic fibers at least partially non-randomly distributed in the channels. A fluid pressure differential is applied to the fibrous web disposed on the forming member, thereby molding the fibrous web according to the pattern of channels, wherein the fibrous web disposed on the forming member comprises a first plurality of micro-regions corresponding to a plurality of fluid-permeable areas of the forming member and a second plurality of micro-regions corresponding to a plurality of fluid-impermeable areas of the forming member. The methods also include forming a unitary fibrous structure in which at least some of the plurality of synthetic fibers are disposed in a predetermined pattern and the plurality of cellulosic fibers remain generally randomly distributed throughout at least one layer of the fibrous structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">&#x201c;Unitary fibrous structure&#x201d; is an arrangement comprising a plurality of cellulosic fibers and synthetic fibers that are inter-entangled or otherwise joined to form a sheet product having certain pre-determined microscopic geometric, physical, and aesthetic properties. The cellulosic and/or synthetic fibers may be layered or otherwise arranged in the unitary fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;Micro-geometry&#x201d; or permutations thereof, refers to relatively small (i.e., &#x201c;microscopical&#x201d;) details of the fibrous structure, such as, for example, surface texture, without regard to the structure's overall configuration, as opposed to its overall (i.e., &#x201c;macroscopical&#x201d;) geometry. For example, in the molding member of the present invention, the fluid-permeable areas and the fluid-impermeable areas in combination comprise the micro-geometry of the molding member. Terms containing &#x201c;macroscopical&#x201d; or &#x201c;macroscopically&#x201d; refer to a &#x201c;macro-geometry,&#x201d; or an overall geometry, of a structure or a portion thereof, under consideration when it is placed in a two-dimensional configuration, such as the X-Y plane. For example, on a macroscopical level, a fibrous structure, when disposed on a flat surface, comprises a flat sheet. On a microscopical level, however, the fibrous structure may comprise a plurality of micro-regions that form differential elevations, such as, for example, a network region having a first elevation, and a plurality of fibrous &#x201c;pillows&#x201d; dispersed throughout and outwardly extending from the framework region to form a second elevation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Basis weight&#x201d; is the weight (measured in grams) of a unit area (typically measured in square meters) of the fibrous structure, which unit area is taken in the plane of the fibrous structure. The size and shape of the unit area from which the basis weight is measured is dependent upon the relative and absolute sizes and shapes of the regions having differential basis weights. Basis weight is measured as described in the test method section, below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x201c;Caliper&#x201d; is the macroscopic thickness of a sample. Caliper should be distinguished from the elevation of differential regions, which is a microscopical characteristic of the regions. Most typically, a caliper is measured under a uniformly applied load of 95 grams per square centimeter (g/cm<sup>2</sup>). Caliper is measured as described in the test method section, below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Density&#x201d; is the ratio of the basis weight to a thickness (taken normal to the plane of the fibrous structure) of a region. Apparent density is the basis weight of the sample divided by the caliper with appropriate unit conversions incorporated therein. Apparent density used herein has the units of grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x201c;Machine direction&#x201d; (or &#x201c;MD&#x201d;) is the direction parallel to the flow of the fibrous structure being made through the manufacturing equipment. &#x201c;Cross-machine direction&#x201d; (or &#x201c;CD&#x201d;) is the direction perpendicular to the machine direction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;X,&#x201d; &#x201c;Y,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Z&#x201d; designate a conventional system of Cartesian coordinates, wherein mutually perpendicular coordinates &#x201c;X&#x201d; and &#x201c;Y&#x201d; define a reference X-Y plane, and &#x201c;Z&#x201d; defines an orthogonal to the X-Y plane. When an element, such as, for example, a molding member curves or otherwise deplanes, the X-Y plane follows the configuration of the element.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Substantially continuous&#x201d; region (area/network/framework) refers to an area within which one can connect any two points by an uninterrupted line running entirely within that area throughout the line's length. That is, a substantially continuous region or pattern has a substantial &#x201c;continuity&#x201d; in all directions parallel to the X-Y plane and is terminated only at edges of that region. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in conjunction with &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; is intended to indicate that while an absolute continuity is contemplated, minor deviations from the absolute continuity may be tolerable as long as those deviations do not appreciably affect the performance of the fibrous structure or a molding member as designed and intended.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;Substantially semi-continuous&#x201d; region (area/network/framework) refers to an area which may have &#x201c;continuity&#x201d; in all, but at least one, directions parallel to the X-Y plane, and in which area one cannot connect every set of two points by an uninterrupted line running entirely within that area throughout the line's length. Of course, minor deviations from such continuity may be tolerable as long as those deviations do not appreciably affect the performance of the structure or the molding member.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">&#x201c;Discontinuous&#x201d; regions (or patterns) refer to discrete, and separated from one another areas that are discontinuous in all directions parallel to the X-Y plane.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x201c;Redistribution&#x201d; means at least some of the plurality of fibers comprised in the unitary fibrous structure of the present invention at least partially melt, move, shrink, and/or otherwise change their initial position, condition, and/or shape in the web.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">&#x201c;Co-joined fibers&#x201d; means two or more fibers that have been fused or adhered to one another by melting, gluing, wrapping around, chemical or mechanical bonds, or otherwise joined together while at least partially retaining their respective individual fiber characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Generally, the process of the present invention for making a unitary fibrous structure will be described in terms of forming a web having a plurality of synthetic fibers disposed in a generally non-random pattern and a plurality of cellulosic fibers disposed generally randomly (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). However, as noted above, the method and apparatus of the present invention are also suitable for forming a web having a plurality of cellulosic fibers disposed in a generally non-random pattern and a plurality of synthetic fibers disposed generally randomly (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) and for webs where the cellulosic fibers and the synthetic fibers are disposed in non-random patterns that are different from each other. In embodiments wherein the synthetic fibers are disposed non-randomly, the method may include the steps of: providing a plurality of synthetic fibers onto a forming member such that the synthetic fibers are located at least in predetermined regions or channels; providing a plurality of cellulosic fibers generally randomly on the forming member containing the synthetic fibers; and forming a unitary fibrous structure including the randomly disposed cellulosic fibers and the non-randomly disposed synthetic fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one exemplary embodiment of a continuous process of the present invention in which an aqueous mixture, or aqueous slurry <b>11</b> of cellulosic and synthetic fibers, from a headbox <b>12</b> is deposited on a forming member <b>13</b> to form an embryonic web <b>10</b>. In this particular embodiment, the forming member <b>13</b> is supported by and continuously traveling around rolls <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and <b>13</b><i>c </i>in a direction of the arrow A. The synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be deposited prior to the deposition of the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> and directly onto the forming member <b>13</b>. In certain embodiments, more than one headbox <b>12</b> can be employed and/or the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be deposited onto a forming member <b>13</b> and then transferred to a different forming member where the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> are then deposited. Alternatively, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> could be one of several layers that are deposited onto the forming member <b>13</b> at about the same time as other types of fibers, such as, for example using a multi-layer headbox. In such embodiments, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be disposed adjacent the forming member <b>13</b> and the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> may be provided onto at least some of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. In any case, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> should be deposited in such a way that at least some of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> are directed into predetermined regions, such as channels <b>53</b> present in forming member <b>13</b> (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment of the present invention, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> are provided so as to be predominantly disposed in the channels <b>53</b> of the forming member <b>13</b>. That is, more than half of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> are disposed in the channels <b>53</b> when the web <b>10</b> is being formed. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable for at least about 60%, about 75%, about 80% or substantially all of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> to be disposed in the channels <b>53</b> when the web <b>10</b> is being formed. In addition, it may be desired that the resulting product, web <b>100</b>, includes a certain percentage of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> disposed in one or more layers. For example, it may be desirable that the layer formed by fibers deposited first or closest to the forming member <b>13</b> have a concentration of greater than about 50%, greater than about 60% or greater than about 75% synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. (A suitable method for measuring the percentage of a particular type of fiber in a layer of a web product is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,729 issued to Bruce Janda on Jan. 12, 1993.) Further, in certain embodiments, it may be desired that the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> be provided so as to be disposed predominantly in at least one layer adjacent the layer including the non-randomly disposed synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. In other embodiments, it may be desired that at least a certain percentage of the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> are disposed in at least one layer of the web <b>100</b>, such as for example, greater than about 55%, greater than about 60% or greater than about 75%. Typically, at least one layer of the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> will be disposed generally randomly. Thus, the resulting web <b>100</b> can be provided with a non-random pattern of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> joined to one or more layers of generally randomly distributed cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>). Further, a fibrous structure can be formed that has micro-regions of different basis weight.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The forming member <b>13</b> may be any suitable structure and is typically at least partially fluid-permeable. For example, the forming member <b>13</b> may comprise a plurality of fluid-permeable areas <b>54</b> and a plurality of fluid-impermeable areas <b>55</b>, as shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>. The fluid-permeable areas or apertures <b>54</b> may extend through a thickness H of the forming member <b>13</b>, from the web-side <b>51</b> to the backside <b>52</b>. In certain embodiments, some of the fluid-permeable areas <b>54</b> comprising apertures may be &#x201c;blind,&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d;, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,813, issued to Polat et al. on Oct. 26, 1999. The fluid permeable areas <b>54</b>, whether open, blind or closed form channels <b>53</b> into which fibers can be directed. At least one of the plurality of fluid-permeable areas <b>54</b> and the plurality of fluid-impermeable areas <b>55</b> typically forms a pattern throughout the molding member <b>50</b>. Such a pattern can comprise a random pattern or a non-random pattern and can be substantially continuous (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), substantially semi-continuous (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), discrete (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The forming member <b>13</b> may have any suitable thickness H and, in fact, the thickness H can be made to vary throughout the forming member <b>13</b>, as desired. Further, the channels <b>53</b> may be any shape or combination of different shapes and may have any depth D, which can vary throughout the forming member <b>13</b>. Also, the channels <b>53</b> can have any desired volume. The depth D and volume of the channels <b>53</b> can be varied, as desired, to help ensure the desired concentration of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> in the channels <b>53</b>. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable for the depth D of the channels <b>53</b> to be less than about 254 micrometers or less than about 127 micrometers. Further, the amount of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> deposited onto the forming member <b>13</b> can be varied so as to ensure the desired ratio or percentage of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> and/or cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> are disposed in the channels <b>53</b> of a particular depth D or volume. For example, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to provide enough synthetic fibers <b>101</b> to substantially fill channels <b>53</b> such that virtually no cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> will be located in the channels <b>53</b> during the web making process, while in other embodiments, it may be desirable to provide only enough synthetic fibers <b>101</b> to fill a portion of the channels <b>53</b> such that at least some cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> can also be directed into the channels <b>53</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A vacuum apparatus such as vacuum apparatus <b>14</b> located under the forming member <b>13</b> may be used to apply fluid pressure differential to the slurry disposed on the forming member <b>13</b> to facilitate at least partial dewatering of the embryonic web <b>10</b>. This fluid pressure differential can also help direct the desired fibers, e.g. the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> into the channels <b>53</b> of the forming member <b>13</b>. Other known methods may be used in addition to or as an alternative to the vacuum apparatus <b>14</b> to dewater the web <b>10</b> and/or to help direct the fibers into the channels <b>53</b> of the forming member <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If desired, the embryonic web <b>10</b>, formed on the forming member <b>13</b>, can be transferred from the forming member <b>13</b>, to a felt or other structure such as a molding member. A molding member is a structural element that can be used as a support for the an embryonic web, as well as a forming unit to form, or &#x201c;mold,&#x201d; a desired microscopical geometry of the fibrous structure. The molding member may comprise any element that has the ability to impart a microscopical three-dimensional pattern to the structure being produced thereon, and includes, without limitation, single-layer and multi-layer structures comprising a stationary plate, a belt, a woven fabric (including Jacquard-type and the like woven patterns), a band, and a roll.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the molding member <b>50</b> is fluid permeable and vacuum shoe <b>15</b> applies vacuum pressure that is sufficient to cause the embryonic web <b>10</b> disposed on the forming member <b>13</b> to separate there from and adhere to the molding member <b>50</b>. The molding member <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a belt supported by and traveling around rolls <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>c</i>, and <b>50</b><i>d </i>in the direction of the arrow B. The molding member <b>50</b> has a web-contacting side <b>151</b> and a backside <b>152</b> opposite to the web-contacting side <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The molding member <b>50</b> can take on any suitable form and can be made of any suitable materials. The molding member <b>50</b> may include any structure and be made by any of the methods described herein with respect to the forming member <b>13</b>, although the molding member <b>50</b> is not limited to such structures or methods. For example, the molding member <b>50</b> comprises a resinous framework <b>160</b> joined to a reinforcing element <b>170</b>, as shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>. Further, various designs of Jacquard-weave patterns may be utilized as the molding member <b>50</b>, and/or a pressing surface <b>210</b>. If desired, the molding member <b>50</b> may be or include a press felt. Suitable press felts for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to those described herein with respect to the forming member <b>13</b></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain embodiments, the molding member <b>50</b> may comprise a plurality of fluid-permeable areas <b>154</b> and a plurality of fluid-impermeable areas <b>155</b>, as shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. The fluid-permeable areas or apertures <b>154</b> extend through a thickness H<b>1</b> of the molding member <b>50</b>, from the web-side <b>151</b> to the backside <b>152</b>. As noted above with respect to the forming member <b>13</b>, the thickness H<b>1</b> of the molding member can be any desired thickness. Further, the depth D<b>1</b> and volume of the channels <b>153</b> can vary, as desired. Further, one or more of the fluid-permeable areas <b>154</b> comprising apertures may be &#x201c;blind,&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d;, as described above with respect to the forming member <b>13</b>. At least one of the plurality of fluid-permeable areas <b>154</b> and the plurality of fluid-impermeable areas <b>155</b> typically forms a pattern throughout the molding member <b>50</b>. Such a pattern can comprise a random pattern or a non-random pattern and can be substantially continuous, substantially semi-continuous, discrete or any combination thereof. The portions of the reinforcing element <b>170</b> registered with apertures <b>154</b> in the molding member <b>50</b> may provide support for fibers that are deflected into the fluid-permeable areas of the molding member <b>50</b> during the process of making the unitary fibrous structure <b>100</b>. The reinforcing element can help prevent the fibers of the web being made from passing through the molding member <b>50</b>, thereby reducing occurrences of pinholes in the resulting structure <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain embodiments, the molding member <b>50</b> may comprise a plurality of suspended portions extending from a plurality of base portions, as is taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6,576,090 issued Jun. 10, 2003 to Trokhan et al. In such embodiments, the suspended portions may be elevated from the reinforcing element <b>170</b> to form void spaces between the suspended portions and the reinforcing element <b>170</b>, into which spaces the fibers of the embryonic web <b>10</b> can be deflected to form cantilever portions of the fibrous structure <b>100</b>. The molding member <b>50</b> having suspended portions may comprise a multi-layer structure formed by at least two layers and joined together in a face-to-face relationship. The joined layers may be positioned such that the apertures of one layer are superimposed (in the direction perpendicular to the general plane of the molding member <b>50</b>) with a portion of the framework of the other layer, which portion forms the suspended portion described above. Another embodiment of the molding member <b>50</b> comprising a plurality of suspended portions can be made by a process involving differential curing of a layer of a photosensitive resin, or other curable material, through a mask comprising transparent regions and opaque regions. The opaque regions comprise regions having differential opacity, for example, regions having a relatively high opacity (non-transparent) and regions having a relatively low, partial, opacity (some transparency).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the embryonic web <b>10</b> is disposed on the web-contacting side <b>151</b> of the molding member <b>50</b>, the web <b>10</b> at least partially conforms to the three-dimensional pattern of the molding member <b>50</b>. In addition, various means can be utilized to cause or encourage the cellulosic and/or synthetic fibers of the embryonic web <b>10</b> to conform to the three-dimensional pattern of the molding member <b>50</b> and to become a molded web designated as &#x201c;<b>20</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. (It is to be understood, that the referral numerals &#x201c;<b>10</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>20</b>&#x201d; can be used herein interchangeably, as well as the terms &#x201c;embryonic web&#x201d; and &#x201c;molded web&#x201d;). One method includes applying a fluid pressure differential to the plurality of fibers. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, vacuum apparatuses <b>16</b> and/or <b>17</b> disposed at the backside <b>152</b> of the molding member <b>50</b> can be arranged to apply a vacuum pressure to the molding member <b>50</b> and thus to the plurality of fibers disposed thereon. Under the influence of fluid pressure differential &#x394;P<b>1</b> and/or &#x394;P<b>2</b> created by the vacuum pressure of the vacuum apparatuses <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, respectively, portions of the embryonic web <b>10</b> can be deflected into the channels <b>153</b> of the molding member <b>50</b> and conform to the three-dimensional pattern thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By deflecting portions of the web <b>10</b> into the channels <b>153</b> of the molding member <b>50</b>, one can decrease the density of resulting pillows <b>150</b> formed in the channels <b>153</b> of the molding member <b>50</b>, relative to the density of the rest of the molded web <b>20</b>. Regions <b>168</b> that are not deflected into the apertures may later be imprinted by impressing the web <b>20</b> between a pressing surface <b>218</b> and the molding member <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), such as, for example, in a compression nip formed between a surface <b>210</b> of a drying drum <b>200</b> and the roll <b>50</b><i>c</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. If imprinted, the density of the regions <b>168</b> may increase even more relative to the density of the pillows <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The micro-regions (high and low density) of the fibrous structure <b>100</b> may be thought of as being disposed at two different elevations. As used herein, the elevation of a region refers to its distance from a reference plane (i.e., X-Y plane). The reference plane can be visualized as horizontal, wherein the elevational distance from the reference plane is vertical (i.e., Z-directional). The elevation of a particular micro-region of the structure <b>100</b> may be measured using any non-contacting measurement device suitable for such purpose as is well known in the art. The fibrous structure <b>100</b> according to the present invention can be placed on the reference plane with the imprinted region <b>168</b> in contact with the reference plane. The pillows <b>150</b> extend vertically away from the reference plane. The plurality of pillows <b>150</b> may comprise symmetrical pillows, asymmetrical pillows, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Differential elevations of the micro-regions can also be formed by using the molding member <b>50</b> having differential depths or elevations of its three-dimensional pattern. Such three-dimensional patterns having differential depths/elevations can be made by sanding pre-selected portions of the molding member <b>50</b> to reduce their elevation. Alternatively, a three-dimensional mask comprising differential depths/elevations of its depressions/protrusions, can be used to form a corresponding framework <b>160</b> having differential elevations. Other conventional techniques of forming surfaces with differential elevation can also be used for the foregoing purposes. It should be recognized that the techniques described herein for forming the molding member are also applicable to the formation of the forming member <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To ameliorate possible negative effects of a sudden application of a fluid pressure differential to the fibrous structure made by a vacuum apparatuses <b>16</b> and/or <b>17</b> and/or a vacuum pick-up shoe <b>15</b> that could force some of the filaments or portions thereof all the way through the molding member <b>50</b> and thus lead to forming so-called pin-holes in the resultant fibrous structure, the backside <b>152</b> of the molding member <b>50</b> can be &#x201c;textured&#x201d; to form microscopical surface irregularities. Such surface irregularities can help prevent formation of a vacuum seal between the backside <b>52</b> of the molding member <b>50</b> and a surface of the papermaking equipment (such as, for example, a surface of the vacuum apparatus), creating &#x201c;leakage&#x201d; there between and thus, mitigating certain undesirable consequences of an application of a vacuum pressure in a through-air-drying process. Other methods of creating such leakage are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,718,806; 5,741,402; 5,744,007; 5,776,311 and 5,885,421.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Leakage can also be created using so-called &#x201c;differential light transmission techniques&#x201d; as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,790; 5,554,467; 5,529,664; 5,514,523 and 5,334,289. The molding member <b>50</b> can be made by applying a coating of photosensitive resin to a reinforcing element that has opaque portions, and then exposing the coating to light of an activating wavelength through a mask having transparent and opaque regions, and also through the reinforcing element. Another way of creating backside surface irregularities comprises the use of a textured forming surface, or a textured barrier film, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,504; 5,260,171 and 5,098,522. The molding member <b>50</b> may be made by casting a photosensitive resin over and through the reinforcing element while the reinforcing element travels over a textured surface, and then exposing the coating to light of an activating wavelength through a mask, which has transparent and opaque regions. It should be understood that the methods and structures described in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph may also be applicable to the structure and formation of the forming member <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The process of the present invention may also include a step wherein the embryonic web <b>10</b> (or molded web <b>20</b>) is overlaid with a flexible sheet of material comprising an endless band traveling along with the molding member <b>50</b> so that the embryonic web <b>10</b> is sandwiched, for a certain period of time, between the molding member <b>50</b> and the flexible sheet of material. The flexible sheet of material can have air-permeability less than that of the molding member <b>50</b>, and in some embodiments can be air-impermeable. An application of a fluid pressure differential to the flexible sheet through the molding member <b>50</b> can cause deflection of at least a portion of the flexible sheet towards, and in some instances into, the three-dimensional pattern of the molding member <b>50</b>, thereby forcing portions of the web <b>20</b> disposed on the molding member <b>50</b> to closely conform to the three-dimensional pattern of the molding member <b>50</b>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,965 describes one arrangement of a process and equipment utilizing the flexible sheet of material.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally or alternatively to the fluid pressure differential, mechanical pressure can be used to facilitate formation of a microscopical three-dimensional pattern on the fibrous structure <b>100</b> of the present invention. Such a mechanical pressure can be created by any suitable press surface <b>218</b>, comprising, for example a surface of a roll or a surface of a band. The press surface <b>218</b> can be smooth or have a three-dimensional pattern of its own. In the latter instance, the press surface <b>218</b> can be used as an embossing device, to form a distinctive micro-pattern of protrusions and/or depressions in the fibrous structure <b>100</b> being made, in cooperation with or independently from the three-dimensional pattern of the molding member <b>50</b>. Furthermore, the press surface can be used to deposit a variety of additives, such for example, as softeners, and ink, to the fibrous structure being made. Various other conventional techniques, such as, for example, ink roll, or spraying device, or shower, may be used to directly or indirectly deposit a variety of additives to the fibrous structure being made.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to foreshorten the fibrous structure <b>100</b> of the present invention as it is being formed. For example, the molding member <b>50</b> may be configured to have a linear velocity that is less that that of the forming member <b>13</b>. The use of such a velocity differential at the transfer point from the forming member <b>13</b> to the molding member <b>50</b> can be used to achieve &#x201c;microcontraction&#x201d;. U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,597 describes in detail one example of wet-microcontraction. Such wet-microcontraction may involve transferring the web having a low fiber-consistency from any first member (such as, for example, a foraminous forming member) to any second member (such as, for example, an open-weave fabric) moving slower than the first member. The difference in velocity between the first member and the second member can vary depending on the desired end characteristics of the fibrous structure <b>100</b>. Other patents that describe methods for achieving microcontraction include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,321; 6,361,654 and 6,171,442.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The fibrous structure <b>100</b> may additionally or alternatively be foreshortened after it has been formed and/or substantially dried. For example, foreshortening can be accomplished by creping the structure <b>100</b> from a rigid surface, such as, for example, a surface <b>210</b> of a drying drum <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This and other forms of creping are known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,756, issued Apr. 24, 1992 to Sawdai describes one suitable method for creping a web. Of course, fibrous structures <b>100</b> that are not creped (e.g. uncreped) and/or otherwise foreshortened are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention as are fibrous structures <b>100</b> that are not creped, but are otherwise foreshortened.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to at least partially melt or soften at least some of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. As the synthetic fibers at least partially melt or soften, they may become capable of co-joining with adjacent fibers, whether cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> or other synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. Co-joining of fibers can comprise mechanical co-joining and chemical co-joining. Chemical co-joining occurs when at least two adjacent fibers join together on a molecular level such that the identity of the individual co-joined fibers is substantially lost in the co-joined area. Mechanical co-joining of fibers takes place when one fiber merely conforms to the shape of the adjacent fiber, and there is no chemical reaction between the co-joined fibers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows one embodiment of mechanical co-joining, wherein a fiber <b>111</b> is physically entrapped by an adjacent synthetic fiber <b>112</b>. The fiber <b>111</b> can be a synthetic fiber or a cellulosic fiber. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the synthetic fiber <b>112</b> has a bi-component structure, comprising a core <b>112</b><i>a </i>and a sheath, or shell, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, wherein the melting temperature of the core <b>112</b><i>a </i>is greater than the melting temperature of the sheath <b>112</b><i>b</i>, so that when heated, only the sheath <b>112</b><i>b </i>melts, while the core <b>112</b><i>a </i>retains its integrity. However, it is to be understood that different types of bi-component fibers and/or multi-component fibers comprising more than two components can be used in the present invention, as can single component fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to redistribute at least some of the synthetic fibers in the web <b>100</b> after the web <b>100</b> is formed. Such redistribution can occur while the web <b>100</b> is disposed on the molding member <b>50</b> or at a different time and/or location in the process. For example, a heating apparatus <b>90</b>, the drying surface <b>210</b> and/or a drying drum's hood (such as, for example, a Yankee's drying hood <b>80</b>) can be used to heat the web <b>100</b> after it is formed to redistribute at least some of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can move after application of a sufficiently high temperature, under the influence of at least one of two phenomena. If the temperature is sufficiently high to melt the synthetic fiber <b>101</b>, the resulting liquid polymer will tend to minimize its surface area/mass, due to surface tension forces, and form a sphere-like shape at the end of the portion of fiber that is less affected thermally. On the other hand, if the temperature is below the melting point, fibers with high residual stresses will soften to the point where the stress is relieved by shrinking or coiling of the fiber. This is believed to occur because polymer molecules typically prefer to be in a non-linear coiled state. Fibers that have been highly drawn and then cooled during their manufacture are comprised of polymer molecules that have been stretched into a meta-stable configuration. Upon subsequent heating, the fibers attempt to return to the minimum free energy coiled state.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Redistribution may be accomplished in any number of steps. For example, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can first be redistributed while the fibrous web <b>100</b> is disposed on the molding member <b>50</b>, for example, by blowing hot gas through the pillows of the web <b>100</b>, so that the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> are redistributed according to a first pattern. Then, the web <b>100</b> can be transferred to another molding member <b>50</b> wherein the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can be further redistributed according to a second pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Heating the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> in the web <b>100</b> can be accomplished by heating the plurality of micro-regions corresponding to the fluid-permeable areas <b>154</b> of the molding member <b>50</b>. For example, a hot gas from the heating apparatus <b>90</b> can be forced through the web <b>100</b>. Pre-dryers can also be used as the source of heat energy. In any case, it is to be understood that depending on the process, the direction of the flow of hot gas can be reversed relative to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that the hot gas penetrates the web through the molding member <b>50</b>. Then, the pillow portions <b>150</b> of the web that are disposed in the fluid-permeable areas <b>154</b> of the molding member <b>50</b> will be primarily affected by the hot gas. The rest of the web <b>100</b> will be shielded from the hot gas by the molding member <b>50</b>. Consequently, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> will be softened or melted predominantly in the pillow portions <b>150</b> of the web <b>10</b>. Further, this region is where co-joining of the fibers due to melting or softening of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> is most likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although the redistribution of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> has been described above as having been affected by passage of hot gas over at least a portion of some of the fibers <b>101</b>, any suitable means for heating the fibers <b>101</b> can be implemented. For example, hot fluids may be used, as well as microwaves, radio waves, ultrasonic energy, laser or other light energy, heated belts or rolls, hot pins, magnetic energy, or any combination of these or other known means for heating. Further, although redistribution of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> has generally been referred to as having been affected by heating the fibers <b>101</b>, redistribution may also take place as a result of cooling a portion of the web <b>10</b>. As with heating, cooling of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may cause the fibers <b>101</b> to change shape and/or reorient themselves with respect to the rest of the web. Further yet, the synthetic fibers may be redistributed due to a reaction with a redistribution material. For example, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be targeted with a chemical composition that softens or otherwise manipulates the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> so as to affect some change in their shape, orientation or location within the web <b>10</b>. Further yet, the redistribution can be affected by mechanical and/or other means such as magnetics, static electricity, etc. Accordingly, redistribution of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>, as described herein, should not be considered to be limited to just heat redistribution of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>, but should be considered to encompass all known means for redistributing (e.g. altering the shape, orientation or location) of any portion of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> within the web <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be redistributed in a manner and by means described herein, the process for producing the web can be selected such that the random distribution of the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> is not significantly affected by the means used to redistribute the synthetic fibers <b>101</b>. Thus, the resulting fibrous structure <b>100</b> whether redistributed or not comprises a plurality of cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> randomly distributed throughout the fibrous structure and a plurality of synthetic fibers <b>101</b> distributed throughout the fibrous structure in a non-random pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> schematically shows one embodiment of the fibrous structure <b>100</b> wherein the cellulosic fibers <b>102</b> are randomly distributed throughout the structure, and the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> are distributed in a non-random repeating pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one example, the method for making the unitary fibrous structure of the present invention comprises a step of redistributing at least some of the synthetic fibers to form a unitary fibrous structure in which at least some of the plurality of synthetic fibers are distributed in a pattern different from the pattern formed by the pattern of channels.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can be any material, for example, those selected from the group consisting of polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polysaccharides, and any combination thereof. More specifically, the material of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can be selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, polyethylene, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate), isophthalic acid copolymers, ethylene glycol copolymers, polycaprolactone, poly(hydroxy ether ester), poly(hydroxy ether amide), polyesteramide, poly(lactic acid), polyhydroxybutyrate, starch, cellulose, glycogen and any combination thereof. Further, the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> can be single component (i.e. single synthetic material or mixture makes up entire fiber), bi-component (i.e. fiber is divided into regions, the regions including two different synthetic materials or mixtures thereof) or multi-component fibers (i.e. fiber is divided into regions, the regions including two or more different synthetic materials or mixtures thereof) or any combination thereof. Also, any or all of the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> may be treated before, during or after the process of the present invention to change any desired property of the fibers. For example, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to treat the synthetic fibers <b>101</b> before or during the papermaking process to make them more hydrophilic, more wettable, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method of making the web of the present invention may also include any other desired steps. For example, the method may include converting steps such as winding the web onto a roll, calendering the web, embossing the web, perforating the web, printing the web and/or joining the web to one or more other webs or materials to form multi-ply structures. Some exemplary patents describing embossing include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,414,459; 3,556,907; 5,294,475 and 6,030,690. In addition, the method may include one or more steps to add or enhance the properties of the web such as adding softening, strengthening and/or other treatments to the surface of the product or as the web is being formed. Further, the web may be provided with latex, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,879,257 or other materials or resins to provide beneficial properties to the web.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A variety of products can be made using the fibrous structure <b>100</b> of the present invention. For example, the resultant products may find use in filters for air, oil and water; vacuum cleaner filters; furnace filters; face masks; coffee filters, tea or coffee bags; thermal insulation materials and sound insulation materials; nonwovens for one-time use sanitary products such as diapers, feminine pads, and incontinence articles; textile fabrics for moisture absorption and softness of wear such as microfiber or breathable fabrics; an electrostatically charged, structured web for collecting and removing dust; reinforcements and webs for hard grades of paper, such as wrapping paper, writing paper, newsprint, corrugated paper board, and webs for tissue grades of paper such as toilet paper, paper towel, napkins and facial tissue; medical uses such as surgical drapes, wound dressing, bandages, and dermal patches. The fibrous structure <b>100</b> may also include odor absorbents, termite repellents, insecticides, rodenticides, and the like, for specific uses. The resultant product may absorb water and oil and may find use in oil or water spill clean-up, or controlled water retention and release for agricultural or horticultural applications.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Test Methods:</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Caliper is measured according to the following procedure, without considering the micro-deviations from absolute planarity inherent to the multi-density tissues made according to the aforementioned incorporated patents.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The tissue paper is preconditioned at 71&#xb0; to 75&#xb0; F. and 48 to 52 percent relative humidity for at least two hours prior to the caliper measurement. If the caliper of toilet tissue or other rolled products is being measured, 15 to 20 sheets are first removed from the outside of the roll and discarded. If the caliper of facial tissue or other boxed products is being measured, the sample is taken from near the center of the package. The sample is selected and then conditioned for an additional 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Caliper is measured using a low load Thwing-Albert Progage micrometer, Model 89-2012, available from the Thwing-Albert Instrument Company of Philadelphia, Pa. The micrometer loads the sample with a pressure of 95 grams per square inch using a 2.0 inch diameter presser foot and a 2.5 inch diameter support anvil. The micrometer has a measurement capability range of 0 to 0.0400 inches. Decorated regions, perforations, edge effects, etc., of the tissue should be avoided if possible.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Basis weight is measured according to the following procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The tissue sample is selected as described above, and conditioned at 71&#xb0; to 75&#xb0; F. and 48 to 52 percent humidity for a minimum of 2 hours. Twelve finished product sheets are carefully selected, which are clean, free of holes, tears, wrinkles, folds, and other defects. To be clear, finished product sheets should include the number of plies that the particular finished product to be tested has. Thus, one ply product sample sets will contain 12 one-ply sheets; two ply product sample sets will contain 12 two ply sheets; and so on. The sample sets are split into two stacks each containing 6 finished product sheets. A stack of six finished product sheets is placed on top of a cutting die. The die is square, having dimensions of 3.5 inches by 3.5 inches and may have soft polyurethane rubber within the square to ease removal of the sample from the die after cutting. The six finished product sheets are cut using the die, and a suitable pressure plate cutter, such as a Thwing-Albert Alfa Hydraulic Pressure Sample Cutter, Model 240-7A. The second set of six finished product sheets is cut in the same manner. The two stacks of cut finished product sheets are combined into a 12 finished product sheet stack and conditioned for at least 15 additional minutes at 71&#xb0; to 75&#xb0; F. and 48 to 52 percent humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The stack of 12 finished product sheets cut as described above is then weighed on a calibrated analytical balance having a resolution of at least 0.0001 grams. The balance is maintained in the same room in which the samples were conditioned. A suitable balance is made by Sartorius Instrument Company, Model A200S.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The basis weight, in units of pounds per 3,000 square feet, is calculated according to the following equation:</p>
