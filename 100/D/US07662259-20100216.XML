<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the manufacture of paper, various fabrics are used to form, dewater, mold, dry, support, and/or transfer the paper web from the headbox to the reel. During the operation of the paper machine, these fabrics often become dirty, contaminated with residual fibers, or contaminated with residual chemicals. As a result, fabric cleaning apparatuses such as flooded nip showers, scarfing showers, high pressure fan jets, needle showers, and the like are used to remove the contaminants. This process can leave the fabric relatively wet after being sprayed by water, which is typically used as the cleaning agent. For applications where the fabric operates in a wet environment, such as the forming section, the retained moisture on the fabric after the cleaning process poses few, if any, issues. However, for fabrics which need to be relatively dry to carry out their intended function, or for fabrics that carry the paper web through the drying section, the retained water can cause operational issues or significantly increase the drying costs required to evaporate the retained moisture on the fabric after the cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, fabrics operating in the dryer section of the paper machine are dewatered after cleaning by the use of a vacuum box, an air knife, or an air shower to blow the excess water from the fabric. Vacuum has the disadvantage of being the most expensive of these options to produce and is limited in differential pressure obtainable by the available atmospheric pressure. The air knife can have several drawbacks when used for dewatering the cleaned fabric. First, compressed air is relatively expensive and the operation of one or more air knives can consume a large amount of energy when used to dewater the fabric. Second, an air knife is only partially effective in removing all of the retained water in the fabric after cleaning. Additionally, air knives and vacuum boxes can create drag on the fabric surface, which increases the fabric's wear rate, thereby reducing the fabric's life.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, what is needed is a fabric dewatering apparatus and method that consumes less energy. Also, what is needed is a fabric dewatering apparatus and method that removes more retained moisture from the fabric.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventors have determined that the above problems and needs can be met by a fabric dewatering device that uses a wicking substrate, such as a felt, that is brought into contact with the wet fabric after the fabric has been cleaned. The felt can be used as the only method of dewatering the cleaned fabric, or the felt can be used in conjunction with an air knife or other apparatus for removing water from the cleaned fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in one embodiment, the invention resides in a fabric dewatering apparatus for use after a fabric cleaning apparatus in a paper machine including: an endless wicking substrate disposed for rotation about a dryer roll; the endless wicking substrate and the fabric brought into surface contact as the fabric traverses at least a portion of the dryer roll's circumference; and a wicking substrate dewatering apparatus disposed along the wicking substrate's travel path after the dryer roll.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in another embodiment, the invention resides in a method of dewatering a fabric comprising contacting the fabric with an endless wicking substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention, which broader aspects are embodied in the exemplary construction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> is illustrated. Prior to being dewatered, a fabric <b>22</b> is cleaned by a fabric cleaning apparatus <b>24</b> such as a flooded nip shower, a scarfing shower, a high pressure fan jet, a needle shower, or combinations of various showers and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, a flooded nip shower <b>25</b> is utilized, but other fabric cleaning apparatus as known to those of skill in the art can be used. Sometime after the fabric <b>22</b> leaves the fabric cleaning apparatus <b>24</b>, the fabric <b>22</b> is brought into surface contact with an endless wicking substrate <b>26</b> such as a felt. One method of accomplishing the surface contact is by wrapping both the fabric <b>22</b> and the felt <b>26</b> about a drying roll <b>28</b> with the felt contacting the surface of the dryer roll. While the felt and fabric are in surface contact, the fabric is dewatered by the felt. Thereafter, the felt and fabric diverge as the fabric is returned to the start of its run through the paper machine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">After the fabric and felt diverge, the felt is dried by a wicking substrate dewatering apparatus <b>30</b> disposed along the wicking substrate's travel path after the dryer roll <b>28</b>. The felt dewatering apparatus <b>30</b> can be any commonly known device for removing water from the felt <b>26</b>, such as a dryer, a blower, a vacuum device, an air knife, or a pressure roll nip. A preferred felt dewatering apparatus is a pressure roll nip <b>32</b> having a felt pressure roll <b>34</b> and a felt vacuum roll <b>36</b>. A pressure roll nip is a relatively low cost method of dewatering the felt as compared to other methods. However, depending on whether the objective is to save energy in dewatering the fabric <b>22</b> or to increase productivity of the paper machine by removing as much water from the fabric <b>22</b> as possible, more expensive methods of drying the felt can be used. After the felt dewatering apparatus <b>30</b>, the felt <b>26</b> is guided and tensioned by suitable rolls, as known to those of skill in the art, to return the felt to its entry point on the drying roll <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the invention, the fabric's pressure alone, by being wrapped about the drying roll <b>28</b>, is sufficient to dewater the fabric <b>22</b>. For example, a typical fabric tension can be on the order of 20 pounds per inch while a typical drying roll can have a radius of approximately 18 inches. Thus, the surface pressure the fabric <b>22</b> exerts on the felt <b>26</b> as it is directed about the drying roll <b>28</b> is equal to T/R or approximately 1 psi. The felt and the fabric can be brought into contact for a sufficient period of time by providing a sufficient wrap angle on the drying roll <b>28</b>. The wrap angle can be varied from a relatively small angle to a substantially large angle to achieve the desired dwell time by varying the both the wrap angle and the drying roll's radius. During the fabric's surface contact with the felt, the fabric is dewatered as it traverses the periphery of the drying roll <b>28</b> as determined by the wrap angle.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Surprisingly, the inventors have determined that a felt can be used to dewater a fabric. Previously, felts have been used to dewater a paper web by sandwiching the paper web between a Yankee dryer on one side and a felt backed by a pressure roll on the opposite side. In the wet pressed process, an extremely high nip load such as 400 pli is used to force the water from the paper web into the felt. The high nip load compresses the weak paper web and squeezes the water from the paper web into the felt. In contrast, the fabric wrap on the dryer roll used by the inventors has a significantly lower loading pressure. Additionally, the fabric is relatively incompressible when compared to the water saturated paper web of the wet pressed process. Since the fabric pressure on the felt is so low and since the fabric is relatively incompressible in comparison to the wet pressed process, it was unexpected that the felt in surface contact with the fabric would adequately dewater the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The endless wicking substrate <b>26</b> can contact either side or even both sides of the fabric <b>22</b> (paper web contacting surface or paper machine contacting surface) and will generally be placed to contact the side of the fabric side having more retained water. For example, gravity may bias more water to one side, or an air knife or vacuum box may bias more water to one side. Centrifugal force may bias more water to one side of the fabric as disclosed in U.S. patent application 2005/0204580 dated Sep. 22, 2005, by Jewitt entitled Apparatus For Conditioning A Fabric In A Papermaking Machine And Associated Method, herein incorporated by reference. As such, it is possible to reverse the orientation of the fabric <b>22</b> and the endless wicking substrate <b>26</b> as they traverse the periphery of the drying roll <b>28</b> by using a lead in and/or an exit roll, or other method, to wrap both the fabric and the wicking substrate about the circumference of the drying roll similar to the path of the fabric about a through air dryer in a paper machine. In this manner, the fabric will contact the drying roll's <b>28</b> surface and the wicking substrate will wrap the fabric under tension dewatering the fabric with the aid of centrifugal force, thereby moving the water towards the wicking substrate. The endless wicking substrate may also be selected to contact the more open or coarse side of the fabric and the retained water may be preferentially directed to this side by the above methods.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment of the invention, an optional fabric pressure roll <b>38</b> can be used to create a fabric nip <b>40</b> to increase the fabric's pressure contact with the felt on the drying roll <b>28</b>. The fabric pressure roll <b>38</b> can be used to promote increased surface contact between the felt and fabric. The fabric pressure roll can be especially helpful for highly three-dimensional fabrics having an undulating surface topography to ensure the wicking substrate <b>26</b> engages more surface area of the fabric. Suitable loads for the fabric pressure roll <b>38</b> to enhance dewatering are between about 50 lb/in to about 400 lb/in, or between about 50 lb/in to about 200 lb/in.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A doctor blade <b>39</b> can be provided to doctor the fabric pressure roll <b>38</b> to remove loose fibers and/or water from the roll, reducing rewet of the fabric <b>22</b> and/or felt <b>26</b>. A suitable pan <b>41</b> can be provided to capture and divert the water and fibers from dripping onto the fabric <b>22</b>, the paper web, or other portions of the paper machine, which can cause operational issues, such as holes in the paper web, leading to web breaks.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment of the invention, a second drying roll <b>29</b> can be used in place of the fabric pressure roll <b>38</b> and a second wicking substrate (felt) <b>27</b> can be wrapped about the second drying roll and brought into contact with the opposite surface of the fabric <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The two drying rolls and felts can be nipped together with the fabric <b>22</b> disposed between them to dewater both sides of the fabric. The nip load can be the same ranges as discussed above for the fabric pressure roll <b>38</b>. The fabric <b>22</b> can be sent through the fabric nip <b>40</b> with little to no wrap about the drying rolls. Alternatively, the fabric may wrap only one of the drying rolls and be in line contact with the other felt similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Desirably, the fabric <b>22</b> also wraps at least a portion of the second drying roll <b>29</b> as shown. In this mode, the fabric <b>22</b> will have an S-wrap as it traverses the path through the nipped drying rolls (<b>28</b>, <b>29</b>). The amount of wrap on each drying roll may be dictated by the relative two-sidedness of the fabric and need not be approximately equal as shown. More wrap may be desired on the side of the fabric that is coarser to promote more dwell time for water removal. Both felts would then be subsequently dewatered by the felt dewatering apparatus <b>30</b>, guided and returned to the fabric nip <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various embodiments of the invention, the wrap angle of the fabric <b>22</b> about the dryer roll <b>28</b> or rolls (<b>28</b> and <b>29</b>) can be between about 0 degrees to about 300 degrees, or between about 10 degrees to about 270 degrees, or between about 10 degrees to about 200 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment of the invention, an air knife <b>42</b> and/or vacuum box can be retained for use in dewatering the fabric <b>22</b> along with the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b>. The air knife and/or vacuum box can be used either before or after the fabric dewatering apparatus along the fabric's travel path. In one embodiment, the air knife <b>42</b> is located after the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> since the fabric dewatering apparatus may be more efficient in removing larger quantities of water immediately after the flooded nip shower <b>25</b> than the air knife. However, depending on the fabric's design or texture, it can be beneficial to locate the air knife <b>42</b> before the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> and to operate the air knife at a reduced pressure. Each fabric dewatering element (fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b>, air knife <b>42</b>, or vacuum box) needs to be evaluated to determine the best location and operating condition of the element that results in the lowest water content of the fabric and/or lowest energy usage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Without the help of the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b>, an air knife <b>42</b> can consume about 400-500 kW of electricity for a typical 140-inch wide tissue machine. Dewatering the fabric <b>22</b> using only an air knife <b>42</b> without the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> can be an expensive solution. The fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> can be used as a low cost method to remove water from the fabric <b>22</b>. This may be desirable for paper machines that are not dryer limited in order to save energy in the form of compressed air. For paper machines that are dryer limited, an air knife <b>42</b> may also be employed along with the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> to remove as much water as possible from the fabric <b>22</b> in order to gain additional paper tons by reducing the dryer load required to dry the retained moisture in the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The endless wicking substrate <b>26</b> can be any substrate that pulls or absorbs water from the fabric <b>22</b>. In general, the pore size of the wicking substrate will be smaller than the effective channel size of the fabric <b>22</b> to remove water by capillary action when brought into contact with the fabric. As fabrics can have complex weaves, the effective channel size refers to the between-yarn openings in the fabric adjacent to the wicking substrate that can serve to hold water due to capillary forces. A preferred wicking substrate would have a large void volume for holding water and small pores in contact with the fabric. Suitable wicking substrates can include fabrics with the correct pore size, felts typically used in the paper industry such as press felts, press felts with additional nap on the surface, and capillary membranes as referred to in the following patents: U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,643, U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,626 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,682, all herein incorporated by reference. Preferred wicking substrates include felts having a small pore size in contact with the fabric and high water carrying capability that are moldable, or have additional nap to allow intimate contact between the felt and the fabric, and that are resistant to the desired operating nip loads. The ability of the felt to better conform to the topographical features of a fabric is beneficial as this allows more opportunity for the water to move into the felt in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The drying roll <b>28</b> can be any suitable roll for wrapping the fabric <b>22</b> about the felt <b>26</b> supported by the drying roll and to bring the two into surface contact as the fabric traverses at least a portion of the dryer roll's circumference. In general, the diameter of the drying roll will be dictated by the loads imposed on the roll, the length of the roll, the desired dwell time for the fabric to contact the felt, and the wrap angle of the fabric about the roll. Suitable roll diameters are selected to limit deflection of the roll, which is influenced by the fabric's tension and the machine's width. Typical roll diameters can be between about 18 inches to about 36 inches in diameter. Since dryer roll <b>28</b> is wrapped by both the fabric <b>22</b> and the felt <b>26</b>, the tension of the two together needs to be taken into consideration in the design of the roll. Doctoring by use of a doctor blade <b>39</b> and optional pan <b>41</b> may be required on fabric pressure roll <b>38</b>, depending on the amount of water that is required to be removed from the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> is shown installed in one possible location in a paper machine <b>44</b>. As mentioned, the dewatering apparatus can be used on any desired fabric in the paper machine, but will ordinarily be used on the fabric that transports the paper web through the dryer. Furthermore, use of the dewatering apparatus is not limited to the specific paper machine shown as it can be used with any type of paper machine.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, the paper machine includes a forming section <b>46</b>, a drying section <b>48</b>, and a creping section <b>50</b>. The forming section includes a headbox <b>52</b> and one or more forming fabrics <b>54</b>. After formation, the tissue web is transferred by a transfer shoe <b>55</b> to a dryer fabric <b>56</b> that carries the tissue web through a through air dryer <b>58</b>. The through air dryer is used to dry the tissue web to its final consistency prior to being creped.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The dryer fabric <b>56</b>, after being cleaned by a flooded nip shower and dewatered by conventional equipment, such as an air knife, can carry on the order of approximately 10 gsm to about 80 gsm of water into the through air dryer <b>58</b>. A typical paper web entering the through air dyer, after being formed and dewatered by vacuum boxes, can have approximately 20 gsm of fiber and 60 gsm of retained water. Thus, for some paper machines, the dryer load imposed by the retained water in the dryer fabric can be a significant portion of the total energy used to dry the paper web. Reducing the amount of retained water in the dryer fabric <b>56</b> can save a significant amount of energy per year or allow for a significant increase in speed for paper machines that are dryer limited.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After being through air dried, the paper web is applied to a Yankee dryer <b>60</b> by a pressure roll <b>62</b>. The paper web is then creped off of the surface of the Yankee dryer by a creping blade <b>64</b> to form a creped tissue web <b>66</b>. The dryer fabric <b>56</b> is then sent through the flooded nip shower <b>25</b> to remove residual fibers and creping chemicals that are sprayed onto the Yankee dryer to adhere the tissue web to the dryer's surface. The dryer fabric <b>56</b> is then dewatered by the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. After being dewatered, the dryer fabric <b>56</b> is advanced to the transfer shoe <b>55</b> to begin its cycle again.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Experimental Fabric Dewatering Test Results</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To test the ability of a felt to dewater a fabric, several bench tests were conducted. A WeaveXX Millennium 1C felt sample, with chemical resistant B treatment, available from WeaveXX Corporation of Westborough, Mass., having an area of approximately 30 in<sup>2 </sup>(6.75 inch by 4.5 inch) was utilized. The felt sample had the following approximate properties: A finished weight of 4.58 oz/ft<sup>2</sup>, a caliper of 0.102 inches, a permeability of 18.1 cfm (per square foot of sample tested at 0.5 inches water column), and a needle code of 0412-T1T3T4. The first substrate layer was composed of 15 denier yarns that weighed about 85 gsm. The second substrate layer was composed of a 6/15 denier mix that weighed about 255 gsm. The cap layer was composed of 3 denier yarns that weighed about 300 gsm.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A TissueMax M fabric sample available from Voith Paper Fabrics, Forming Fabric Division, 3040 Blackcreek Rd., Wilson, N.C. 27893, having an area of approximately 30 in<sup>2 </sup>(6.75 inch by 4.5 inch) was used for the fabric sample in the dewatering experiments. The fabric was stacked on top of the felt by aligning all four edges of each sample. A thin sheet of film, such as a clear overhead transparency sheet, was then placed over the fabric sample. Prior to conducting each test, the dry weights of the felt and fabric samples were recorded. Then the fabric and/or felt samples were wetted to the indicated moisture content by uniformly spraying the surface of each with water. The wet weights of the felt and fabric samples were recorded. For the wetted felt samples, the felt was saturated to approximately 100% moisture content by spraying with about 30 grams of water. For the fabric samples, the moisture content was varied as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Shortly after wetting the felt and fabric samples, the felt was placed on a moisture impermeable surface, the fabric sample stacked directly on top of the felt, the moisture impermeable film placed over the fabric, and a weight was placed onto the stack for approximately 1 sec. The weight was then removed and the final weight of the fabric sample was recorded. The weight weighed approximately 8.8 lbs and loaded the fabric into the felt at approximately 0.3 psi, a loading pressure less than or equal to a possible loading pressure in a commercial situation utilizing only the fabric's tension to bring the fabric and felt into surface contact.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For each test, the percent water removed was determined by subtracting the fabric's final weight from the initial wet weight and then dividing the result by the initial wet weight. Table 1 shows the results obtained by various retained moisture levels of the fabric and using either a pre-moistened or bone dry felt.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As seen in Table 1, a wicking substrate <b>26</b>, such as a felt, is an effective means for removing water from a fabric, without consuming an appreciable amount of energy. Additionally, a moist or wet felt was more effective in removing water from the fabric sample than a bone dry felt. Also as illustrated in the table, the wet felt was more effective in removing water from the fabric when the fabric contained higher amounts of water. Thus, the fabric dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> may be better suited to being located immediately after the flooded nip shower <b>25</b> to remove water from the fabric when it is at its highest amount. If additional water removal is needed, an air knife, vacuum box, or other device can be located after the dewatering apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various embodiments of the invention, the dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> can be used to remove greater than about 10 gsm, about 25 gsm, about 35 gsm, or about 45 gsm of the showering water from the fabric <b>22</b>. In various embodiments of the invention, the dewatering apparatus can be used to remove between about 10 gsm to about 70 gsm, or between about 20 gsm to about 70 gsm, or between about 30 gsm to about 70 gsm of the showering water. In various embodiments of the invention, the dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> can be used to remove at least 15 percent, at least 25 percent, or at least 35 percent of the showering water from the fabric. In various embodiments of the invention, the dewatering apparatus <b>20</b> can be used to remove between about 15 percent to about 50 percent, or between about 25 percent to about 50 percent, or between about 35 percent to about 50 percent of the showering water.</p>
