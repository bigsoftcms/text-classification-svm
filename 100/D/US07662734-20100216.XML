<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a woven belt which is made by weaving a plurality of fiber bundles, which are substantially perpendicular to each other, into a band shape and, more particularly, to a woven belt having high load bearing capacity and a seat belt apparatus using the same as a webbing thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, woven belt which is made by weaving high strength fibers has been frequently used as a band for restraining heavy goods or for bundling a plurality of materials. A well known example of use of such a woven belt is a webbing of a seat belt apparatus for restraining the body of an occupant in a seat of a vehicle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The webbing of the seat belt apparatus is required to have not only basic performance such as load bearing characteristic capable of restraining the body of the occupant in the event of a vehicle collision but also various performances such as comfort during wearing thereof and easiness of withdrawing the webbing from a retractor which is a retractor device of the webbing. Therefore, various technologies have been proposed for improving fibers used for a woven belt and the weaving structure of the fibers (for example, see Patent document 1).
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent document 1: JP-A-2004-315984</li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">By its very nature, woven belt is generally is used repeatedly not single-use. For example, in the aforementioned case of the seat belt apparatus, the woven belt is put on after the occupant gets on the vehicle and the woven belt is put off before the occupant gets out of the vehicle. Also in case that the woven belt is used for carrying materials and for heavy goods, the woven belt is taken off after used to restrain or bundle the objects and is again put on for the next time of using.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">According to the nature of the woven belt which is repeatedly put on and off and on which a large tension is applied when used, the woven belt is desired to have a abrasion resistance as large as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide a woven belt which can have improved abrasion resistance and a seat belt apparatus using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">For achieving the object, the first invention is a woven belt which is made by weaving first fiber bundle(s) extending in substantially the longitudinal direction of webbing and second fiber bundle(s) extending in substantially the width direction of the webbing, wherein at least either of the first fiber bundle and the second fiber bundle is fiber bundle containing thermal adhesive yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">When the thermal adhesive yarns having a characteristic capable being welded by heating are used in the first fiber bundle or the second fiber bundle, the first fiber bundle or the second fiber bundle is welded and strongly bonded to the other fiber bundle by heating, thereby improving the strength. As a result, improved abrasion resistance is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">The second invention is the same woven belt as the aforementioned first invention and is characterized in that the first fiber bundle is fiber bundle containing a normal synthetic fiber yarn and the second fiber bundle is the fiber bundle containing a thermal adhesive yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The first fiber bundle is fiber bundle of normal synthetic fiber yarns, while the second fiber bundle uses the thermal adhesive yarns so as to increase the strength of the fiber bundle. Accordingly, the strength can be improved as compared to the case that the both fiber bundles are normal fiber bundles, thereby improving the abrasion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">The third invention is the woven belt as the aforementioned first or second invention and is characterized in that the thermal adhesive yarn comprises a low melting point filament component having a relatively low melting point and a high melting point filament component having a relatively high melting point.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">The low melting point filament component is melted by heating and is thus welded and strongly bonded to the other fiber bundle (the second fiber bundle or the first fiber bundle), thereby improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">The fourth invention is the same woven belt as the third invention and is characterized in that the low melting point filament component is arranged in a peripheral portion of the thermal adhesive yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">The low melting point filament component arranged in the peripheral portion is welded and strongly bonded to other single yarns or fiber bundles by heating process, thereby improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The fifth invention is the same woven belt as the third or fourth invention and is characterized in that the melting point of the high melting point filament component is in a range of from 250&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. and the melting point of the low melting point filament component is in a range of from 160&#xb0; C. to less than 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">Accordingly, by curing, for example, at a temperature of from 150&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. for a time period of from 300 seconds to 180 seconds, the low melting point filament component can be melted without loosing the strength of the high melting point filament component, that is, the bonding function by welding can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">The sixth invention is the same woven belt as one of the aforementioned first through fifth inventions and is characterized in that the thread count of one of the first fiber bundle and the second fiber bundle per 1 inch relative to the other fiber bundle is set to 20 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">By setting the thread count of one of the fiber bundles to 20 or less, the curves of the serpentine configuration of the other fiber bundle when woven becomes gentle so that the stress concentration on the curves can be reduced, thereby also improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The seventh invention is the same woven belt as one of the first through sixth invention and is characterized in that at least one of the first fiber bundle and the second fiber bundle is fiber bundle of non-twisted yarns provided with interlaced portions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The first fiber bundle or the second fiber bundle contains the thermal adhesion yarn and is further provided with the interlaced portions so as to ensure the strength and the abrasion resistance even though non-twisted yarns not expensive twisted yarns are employed. Therefore, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The eighth invention comprises: a woven belt for restraining an occupant; a retractor device capable of winding the woven belt; a buckle which is connected to a fixed side member; and a tongue which is attached to the woven belt and is latched with the buckle, wherein the woven belt is made by weaving first fiber bundle(s) extending in substantially the longitudinal direction of webbing and second fiber bundle(s) extending in substantially the width direction of the webbing, wherein at least either of the first fiber bundle and the second fiber bundle is fiber bundle containing thermal adhesive yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">In the seat belt apparatus of the eighth invention, the thermal adhesive yarns having a characteristic capable being welded by heating is used in the first fiber bundle or the second fiber bundle of the woven belt. The thermal adhesive yarns in the first fiber bundle or the second fiber bundle are welded and strongly bonded to the other fiber bundle (the second fiber bundle or the first fiber bundle) by heating, thereby improving the strength and thus improving the abrasion resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">The present invention provides a woven belt and a seat belt apparatus using the same, in which the strength of the woven belt is improved and the abrasion resistance is thus improved.</p>

One embodiment about the entire structure of the seat belt apparatus which can be commonly used and examples of woven belts as webbings which can be used in the seat belt apparatus will be described.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment of Seat Belt Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">First, an embodiment of a seat belt apparatus which can employ the woven belt will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view showing the entire structure of a seat belt apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention with an occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a seat belt apparatus <b>1</b> comprises a seat belt <b>2</b> as a webbing, a retractor device <b>3</b> for winding up one side of the seat belt <b>2</b> in such a manner as to allow the withdrawal of the seat belt <b>2</b>, a tongue <b>4</b> which is slidably attached to the seat belt <b>2</b>, and a buckle device <b>5</b> which can be latched with the tongue <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">The seat belt <b>2</b> is composed of a woven belt as a webbing in which a warp thread (first fiber bundle) extending substantially in the longitudinal direction thereof and a weft thread (second fiber bundle) extending substantially in the width direction thereof are woven. As mentioned above, the one side of the seat belt <b>2</b> is wound by the retractor device <b>3</b>, the middle portion of the seat belt <b>2</b> is inserted through a deflection fitting <b>6</b>, and the other side end of the seat belt <b>2</b> is pivotally connected to a vehicle body <b>8</b> by an anchor plate <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a vertical sectional view showing an example of the entire schematic structure of the retractor device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the retractor device <b>3</b> comprises a frame <b>9</b>, a spool <b>10</b> onto which the seat belt <b>2</b> is wound, a torsion bar <b>11</b> made of torsionally deformable material, a deceleration sensing means <b>12</b> which senses a large vehicle deceleration generated in the event of an emergency and is thus actuated, a locking mechanism <b>13</b> which blocks at least the rotation of the spool <b>10</b> in the belt withdrawing direction, a spring means <b>14</b> having a spiral spring, a pretensioner <b>15</b> which is actuated in the event of an emergency to generate belt winding torque, and a bush <b>16</b> for transmitting the belt winding torque of the pretensioner <b>15</b> to the spool <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">The locking mechanism <b>13</b> comprises a locking base <b>18</b> which holds a pawl <b>17</b> to allow the rocking action of the pawl <b>17</b>, and a lock gear <b>19</b>. The lock gear <b>19</b> may have the same structure as a heretofore known lock gear so that illustration of details of the structure is omitted. Though the lock gear <b>19</b> normally rotates together with the torsion bar <b>11</b>, the lock gear <b>19</b> is stopped by the actuation of the deceleration sensing means <b>12</b> so as to generate a rotational difference relative to the torsion bar <b>11</b> in the event of an emergency, thereby engaging the pawl <b>17</b> to inner teeth <b>20</b> formed in a side wall of the frame <b>9</b>. As a result, the rotation of the locking base <b>18</b> (i.e. the spool <b>10</b>) in the seat belt withdrawing direction is blocked. Also when the seat belt <b>2</b> is rapidly withdrawn, the locking base <b>18</b> of the locking mechanism <b>13</b> rotates in the seat belt withdrawing direction relative to the lock gear <b>19</b>, thereby blocking the withdrawal of the seat belt <b>2</b> in the same manner as the above, but the detailed illustration of this operation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">The torsion bar <b>11</b> is fitted in the inner side (more precisely, the center side in the radial direction) of the spool <b>10</b> with some looseness to extend in the axial direction. The torsion bar <b>11</b> comprises a torque transmitting section <b>21</b> which is located at one side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the axial direction and is engaged with the other side portion in the axial direction of the spool <b>10</b> not to allow the relative rotation thereof, and a torque transmission section <b>22</b> which is located at the other side (the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the axial direction and is engaged with the locking base <b>18</b> not to allow the relative rotation thereof (that is, which is supported on the locking base <b>18</b> such that the torque transmission section <b>22</b> rotates together with the locking base <b>18</b>). The torsion bar <b>11</b> serves as a function of rotationally connecting the spool <b>10</b> and the locking mechanism <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The spool <b>10</b> comprises a cylindrical body portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>onto which the seat belt <b>2</b> is wound, and a large-diameter cylindrical portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>having an outer diameter larger than that of the cylindrical body portion <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The spool <b>10</b> is rotatably supported between the side walls of the frame <b>9</b>. The spool <b>10</b> is always biased in the seat belt winding direction by the biasing force of the spiral spring of the spring means <b>14</b> through a bush <b>23</b>, the torsion bar <b>11</b>, the second torque transmitting section <b>21</b> of the torsion bar <b>11</b>, and a bush <b>16</b>. As a result of this arrangement, the one side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the torsion bar <b>11</b> in the axial direction is connected to the spool <b>10</b> in such a manner as to allow the rotation together with the spool <b>10</b>. When the pretensioner <b>15</b> is actuated, the belt winding torque generated by the pretensioner <b>15</b> is transmitted to the spool <b>10</b> through the bush <b>16</b>, whereby the spool <b>10</b> winds up a predetermined amount of the seat belt <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Disposed between the spool <b>10</b> and a shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the locking base <b>18</b> is an annular relative rotation locking member <b>24</b>. The relative rotation locking member <b>24</b> has an internal thread (not shown) which is formed in the inner surface thereof. The internal thread engages with an external thread (not shown) which is formed in the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the locking base <b>18</b>. In addition, the relative rotation locking member <b>24</b> is fitted into an axial hole of the spool <b>10</b> such that the relative rotation locking member <b>24</b> can not rotate relative to the spool <b>10</b> and can move in the axial direction. As the spool <b>10</b> rotates in the belt withdrawing direction relative to the locking base <b>18</b>, the relative rotation locking member <b>24</b> rotates together with the spool <b>10</b> and moves in a direction toward the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the seat belt apparatus <b>1</b> having the aforementioned basic structure, an occupant <b>25</b> withdraws the seat belt <b>2</b> from the retractor device <b>3</b> against the winding force thereof and latches the tongue <b>4</b>, attached to the seat belt <b>2</b>, to the buckle device <b>5</b>, thereby wearing the seat belt <b>2</b>. The state that the seat belt <b>2</b> is worn is shown by dashed-dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, the seat belt <b>2</b> extends across two regions, i.e. the chest region and the lower abdominal region of the occupant <b>25</b>. As a result of this, the occupant <b>25</b> is restrained in a seat <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">The most characterized point of the seat belt apparatus having the aforementioned structure is using a fiber bundle containing thermal adhesion yarns as at least either of the warp thread and the weft thread composing the seat belt <b>2</b> (webbing), i.e. the woven belt.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">When thermal adhesion yarns having such a characteristic that it is welded when heated are used in the warp thread or the weft thread, the thermal adhesion yarns are welded to and thus strongly bonded to the other thread (the warp thread or the weft thread) by the heating process, thereby improving the strength (as will be described later). In the seat belt apparatus of this embodiment, the thermal adhesion yarns as mentioned above are used, thereby improving the strength of the fiber bundles of the woven belt and improving the abrasion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the woven belt of the present invention containing the thermal adhesion yarns in the weft thread will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an external view of a woven belt of this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged side view of the woven belt of this embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the woven belt <b>101</b> according to this embodiment is a band-like cloth which is long in the vertical direction of this drawing. The woven belt <b>101</b> shown in this drawing is in a state without parts such as the tongue at it end.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the woven belt <b>101</b> is made by weaving a plurality of warp threads <b>102</b> extending substantially in the longitudinal direction and a weft thread <b>103</b> (hatched portions in this drawing) extending substantially in the width direction. The weft thread is arranged to reciprocate in the width direction of the woven belt <b>101</b> to extend substantially straight. The plurality of warp threads <b>102</b> are arranged to intersect with and enter between parallel lines of the weft thread <b>103</b> alternately so that the warp threads <b>102</b> extend in serpentine configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">The warp thread <b>102</b> and the weft thread <b>103</b> are each composed of a fiber bundle which is made by bundling a plurality of single yarns <b>104</b> (filament, single yarn of minimum unit). The warp thread <b>102</b> is made of normal synthetic fiber. A typical example of the synthetic fiber is a polymer of polyethylene terephthalate which is manufactured by esterification of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. On the other hand, the weft thread <b>103</b> contains thermal adhesion yarns. These are non-twisted yarns which were interlaced at regular intervals and thus gathered.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>5</b>(<i>c</i>) are illustrations showing examples of sectional structures of the aforementioned weft thread <b>103</b> for the woven belt of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">In any of these examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), the weft thread <b>103</b> is a non-twisted fiber bundle composed of a plurality of single yarns of which one third are thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> and the others are normal synthetic yarns <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> are arranged to huddle to one side (the right side in the drawing) and the normal synthetic yarns <b>205</b> are arranged to huddle to the other side (the left side in the drawing) in the sectional structure of the weft thread <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> are arranged to huddle to substantially the center in the lateral direction in the drawing and the normal synthetic yarns <b>205</b> are arranged to huddle equally to the both sides (the left side and the right side in the drawing) of the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> in the sectional structure of the weft thread <b>103</b>. This example is an example which is spun not to generate bias (unevenness) in the lateral direction in the drawing of the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> are arranged to huddle in the center both in the vertical direction and the lateral direction in the drawing and the normal synthetic yarns <b>205</b> are arranged to huddle equally to the peripheral side (outer side) of the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> in the sectional structure of the weft thread <b>103</b>. This example is an example, further improved from the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), which is spun not to generate bias (unevenness) not only in the lateral direction, but also in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an explanatory illustration as a perspective view schematically showing an example of detailed configuration of a bundle of the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each of the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> is typically structured to have a double layered form in which the entire outer surface of a high melting point filament component <b>207</b> having a relatively high melting point is covered and surrounded by a low melting point filament component <b>206</b> as a sheath having a relatively low melting point as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The high melting point filament component <b>207</b> is made of, for example, polyethylene terephthalate and the low melting point filament component <b>206</b> is made of, for example, copolymer of polyethylene isophthalate with the aforementioned polyethylene terephthalate (manufactured by esterification of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and ethylene glycol).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">In this embodiment, a fiber bundle which is made by bundling the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> (monofilaments), i.e. a multifilament is partially used in the weft thread. As the woven belt <b>101</b> manufactured using the weft thread as mentioned above is heated, the copolymer of polyethylene isophthalate with polyethylene terephthalate composing the low melting point filament components in the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> is melted so that the adjacent monofilaments and the adjacent multifilaments are welded to each other, thereby increasing the overall stiffness of the woven belt <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">In the thermal adhesion yarn <b>204</b>, the higher the ratio, i.e. the larger the amount, of polyethylene isophthalate in the copolymer of the low melting filament component <b>206</b>, the lower the melting point of the low melting filament component <b>206</b> is. For example, when the ratio of polyethylene isophthalate in the copolymer is 10% (the ratio of the polyethylene terephthalate is 90%), the obtained thermal adhesion yarn has a melting point of 230&#xb0; C. When the ratio of polyethylene isophthalate in the copolymer is 30% (the ratio of the polyethylene terephthalate is 70%), the obtained thermal adhesion yarn has a melting point of 160&#xb0; C. In this embodiment, the thermal adhesion yarn in which the ratio of polyethylene isophthalate in the copolymer is 30% and which has a melting point of 160&#xb0; C. is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart showing procedures of heating process (heat setting process) of the aforementioned thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b>. After the weft thread <b>103</b> having the aforementioned structure and the warp thread <b>102</b> are woven (step S<b>10</b>) and processed by a predetermined dip dyeing (step S<b>20</b>) and drying (step S<b>30</b>), it is cured, for example, at a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. for 200 seconds, thereby melting only the low melting point filament components <b>206</b> at the same time as the dyeing process (step S<b>40</b>). As a result, in the weft thread <b>103</b>, the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> are welded to each other or to the normal synthetic yarns <b>205</b> or further to the corresponding warp thread <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). After that, it is cooled to a predetermined temperature (step S<b>50</b>), is cut into a predetermined size (step S<b>60</b>), and is then packed (step S<b>70</b>). In this manner, the procedures are terminated. As mentioned above, since the fiber bundle contains the thermal adhesive yarns <b>204</b> having a characteristic capable being welded by heating, the thermal adhesive yarns <b>204</b> are welded and strongly bonded to the fiber bundle of the corresponding yarns by heating, thereby improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">On the other hand, non-twisted yarn will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) is an enlarged illustration showing a part of the weft thread <b>103</b> indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) is an illustration showing a portion where the weft thread <b>103</b> and the warp thread <b>102</b> cross each other. Because the interlaced portions <b>105</b> where yarns are snarled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) are provided at predetermined intervals, the single yarns <b>104</b> are not separated from each other so as to maintain the state of the fiber bundle. The interval for providing the interlaced portions <b>105</b> may be suitably set depending on the thickness and the number of single yarns. Also in the warp thread <b>102</b>, similarly to the weft thread <b>103</b>, interlaced portions where yarns are snarled are provided at predetermined intervals, but its enlarged illustration is omitted. By employing the aforementioned non-twisted yarn, a fiber bundle of which manufacturing cost is reduced because the twisting process is not required and having improved strength and improved abrasion resistance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">As described in the above, according to the woven belt <b>101</b> of this embodiment, the strength of the fiber bundle is improved by employing the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> in the weft thread <b>103</b> as mentioned above, thereby improving the abrasion resistance. Especially by setting the thread count of one of the weft thread <b>103</b> and the warp thread <b>102</b> per 1 inch relative to the other to 20 or less, the curves of the serpentine configuration of the other fiber bundles when woven becomes gentle so that the stress concentration on the curves can be reduced, thereby also improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Especially in this embodiment, the weft thread <b>103</b> contains the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> and is further provided with the interlaced portions <b>105</b> so as to ensure the strength and the abrasion resistance even though non-twisted yarns not expensive twisted yarns are used. Therefore, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">Especially in this embodiment, the thermal adhesive yarn <b>204</b> is provided around its periphery with the low melting point filament component <b>206</b>. The low melting point filament component <b>206</b> is welded and strongly bonded to the other single yarns or fiber bundles, thereby improving the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">By applying the increase in strength and increase in abrasion resistance as mentioned above, the number of the fiber bundles as the weft thread <b>103</b> or warp thread <b>102</b> can be reduced while maintaining the strength of the woven belt <b>101</b> to the normal level. For instance, to ensure the strength of the woven belt, usually the entire density of the woven belt must be increased by increasing the count of the weft thread <b>103</b> and narrowing the interval for insertion of the weft thread <b>103</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>). However, even though a woven belt has a reduced count of the weft thread <b>103</b> and widened interval for insertion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) and a reduced count of warp threads, it is possible to ensure the strength of the woven belt <b>101</b> of normal level. Therefore, the entire weight of the woven belt <b>101</b> can be reduced for the reduced number of fiber bundles without decreasing the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">When the thread count of fiber bundle as one of the weft thread <b>103</b> and the warp thread <b>102</b> per 1 inch relative to the other fiber bundle is set to 20 or less in this application example, the stress concentration on the curves can be reduced as mentioned above, thereby improving the strength. In addition, even when the thread count of the fiber bundle as the warp thread <b>102</b> is reduced for obtaining greater lightweight effect, the strength of the warp thread <b>102</b> can be maintained by reducing the thread count of the weft thread <b>103</b>. The reduction in stiffness of the webbing in the width direction due to the reduction in thread count of the weft thread <b>103</b> can be compensated to the normal level by including the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> in the weft thread <b>103</b>. In case that the woven belt is applied to a seat belt apparatus, the twisting, reversal, and jam of the belt can be prevented, thereby exhibiting the effect of improving the easiness of withdrawing.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">The respective melting points of the filament components <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> are not limited to the aforementioned values. The melting point of the high melting point filament component <b>207</b> is suitably in a range of from 250&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. and the melting point of the low melting point filament component <b>206</b> is suitably in a range of from 160&#xb0; C. to less than 250&#xb0; C. Accordingly, by curing, for example, at a temperature of from 150&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. for a time period of from 300 seconds to 180 seconds, the low melting point filament component <b>206</b> can be melted without loosing the strength of the high melting point filament component <b>207</b>, that is, the bonding effect by welding can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Especially in the embodiment, the increase in strength of fiber bundles is achieved by employing the thermal adhesion yarns <b>204</b> in the weft thread <b>103</b> while employing the fiber bundle of normal synthetic fiber yarns as the warp thread <b>102</b>. The strength can be improved as compared to the case that the weft thread and warp thread are both normal fiber bundles.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">According to the weaving structure, the weft thread <b>103</b> as the second fiber bundle may be fiber bundle of normal synthetic fiber yarns and the warp thread <b>102</b> as the first fiber bundle may contain the thermal adhesive yarns <b>204</b>. Further, the thermal adhesive yarns <b>204</b> may be employed both in the weft thread <b>103</b> and the warp thread <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the weft thread <b>103</b> and the warp thread <b>102</b> may partially contain the thermal adhesive yarns <b>204</b>, respectively. As for the non twisted yarn, both or either of the warp thread <b>102</b> and the weft thread <b>103</b> may be twisted yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">Now, the description of the embodiments of the woven belt and the seat belt apparatus of the present invention is terminated. The concrete structures of the aforementioned embodiments are not intended to strictly limit the subject matters of the present invention and the details may be altered variously without departing from the scope of the invention. Especially though the aforementioned embodiments have been described about examples in which the woven belt is used as a webbing of a seat belt apparatus in a vehicle, the application of the woven belt of the present invention is not limited thereto. The woven belt of the present invention can be suitably applied to general-purpose belts for hanging or carrying something, for example a belt for restraining together heavy goods such as building materials and a body restraining member such as a safety belt or a harness.</p>
