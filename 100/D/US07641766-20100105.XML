<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a method of enhancing paper machine dewatering using aldehyde-functionalized polymers having a specific level of functionalization.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Papermaking comprises taking a slurry of papermaking raw materials at a consistency (weight percent solids) in the range 0.1 to 1.0 weight percent and dewatering it to form a sheet with a final consistency of about 95 weight percent. Paper machines accomplish this dewatering through a series of different processes which include from the beginning to end: 1) gravity or inertial dewatering (early forming section of the machine); 2) vacuum dewatering (late forming section of the machine); 3) press dewatering (press section of the machine); and 4) thermally evaporating the water (dryer section of the machine). The cost of dewatering increases in going from 1 to 4, which makes it advantageous to remove as much water as possible in the earlier stages. The rate of paper production or, equivalently, the machine speed is dictated by the rate at which the water can be removed, and consequently, any chemical treatment which can increase the rate of water removal has value for the papermaker. Many grades of paper require the use of retention aid chemicals for their manufacture in order to retain the fine particles found in the raw materials used to make the paper. It is well known in the paper industry that these retention aids can also enhance the rate of gravity, inertial, and vacuum dewatering or drainage, as it is often called. Such retention chemicals include the well known flocculants, coagulants, and microparticles used in the industry. Existing laboratory free and vacuum drainage tests can readily identify the drainage effects of these retention aid chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The production rate for the vast majority of paper machines is limited by the drying capacity of the machine's dryer section. Consequently, the consistency of the paper sheet leaving the press section and going into the dryer section is most often critical in determining the paper machine speed or production rate. The effects of chemical additives on press dewatering are unclear with little information available on this topic. The effect of retention aid chemicals on press dewatering is often reported to be detrimental as a consequence of the decreased consistency entering the press as a result of increased water retention or reduction in press efficiency resulting from a loss in sheet formation. Both these factors arise from the flocculation of the papermaking particles by the retention chemicals. Because the consistency of the sheet leaving the press section is most often the most critical factor in determining machine speed, any treatment capable of increasing this consistency would obviously be highly desirable. Currently, no chemical treatments are known to be marketed as commercial press dewatering aids, although anecdotal reports suggest that some polymers can favorably effect out going press consistency. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need to develop compositions having effective press dewatering activity.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The aqueous phase is prepared by mixing together in water one or more water-soluble monomers, and any polymerization additives such as inorganic salts, chelants, pH buffers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The oil phase is prepared by mixing together an inert hydrocarbon liquid with one or more oil soluble surfactants. The surfactant mixture should have a low hydrophilic-lypophilic balance (HLB), to ensure the formation of an oil continuous emulsion. Appropriate surfactants for water-in-oil emulsion polymerizations, which are commercially available, are compiled in the North American Edition of McCutcheon's <i>Emulsifiers </i>&#x26; <i>Detergents</i>. The oil phase may need to be heated to ensure the formation of a homogeneous oil solution.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The oil phase is then charged into a reactor equipped with a mixer, a thermocouple, a nitrogen purge tube, and a condenser. The aqueous phase is added to the reactor containing the oil phase with vigorous stirring to form an emulsion.

The monomer solution is mixed vigorously, heated to the desired temperature, and then a free radical initiator is added. The solution is purged with nitrogen while maintaining temperature and mixing for several hours. After this time, the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and any post-polymerization additives are charged to the reactor. Water continuous dispersions of water-soluble polymers are free flowing liquids with product viscosities generally 100-10,000 cP, measured at low shear.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a typical procedure for preparing solution polymers, an aqueous solution containing one or more water-soluble monomers and any additional polymerization additives such as chelants, pH buffers, and the like, is prepared. This mixture is charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, a thermocouple, a nitrogen purging tube and a water condenser. The solution is mixed vigorously, heated to the desired temperature, and then one or more free radical polymerization initiators are added. The solution is purged with nitrogen while maintaining temperature and mixing for several hours. Typically, the viscosity of the solution increases during this period. After the polymerization is complete, the reactor contents are cooled to room temperature and then transferred to storage. Solution polymer viscosities vary widely, and are dependent upon the concentration and molecular weight of the active polymer component.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The polymerization reactions are initiated by any means which results in generation of a suitable free-radical. Thermally derived radicals, in which the radical species results from thermal, homolytic dissociation of an azo, peroxide, hydroperoxide and perester compound are preferred. Especially preferred initiators are azo compounds including 2,2&#x2032;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 2,2&#x2032;-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride, 2,2&#x2032;-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), 2,2&#x2032;-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AIVN), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The polymerization processes can be carried out as a batch process or in steps. In a batch process, all of the reactive monomers are reacted together, whereas in a step or semi-batch process, a portion of the reactive monomer is withheld from the main reaction and added over time to affect the compositional drift of the copolymer or the formation of the dispersion particles.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The polymerization and/or post polymerization reaction conditions are selected such that the resulting polymer comprising amino or amido groups has a molecular weight of at least about 1,000 g/mole, preferably about 2,000 to about 10,000,000 g/mole.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The polymer comprising amino or amido groups is then functionalized by reaction with one or more aldehydes. Suitable aldehydes include any compound containing at least one aldehyde (&#x2014;CHO) functional group having sufficient reactivity to react with the amino or amido groups of the polymer. Representative aldehydes include formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, and the like. Glyoxal is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The aldehyde-functionalized polymer is prepared by reacting the polyamide or polyamine with aldehyde at a pH between 4 to 12. The total concentration of polymer backbone plus aldehyde is between about 5 to about 35 weight percent. Generally, an aqueous solution of the polymer backbone is prepared for better reaction rate control and increased product stability. The pH of the aqueous polymer backbone solution is increased to between about 4 to about 12. The reaction temperature is generally about 20 to about 80&#xb0; C. preferably about 20 to about 40&#xb0; C. An aqueous aldehyde solution is added to the aqueous polymer backbone solution with good mixing to prevent gel formation. After the addition of aldehyde the pH is adjusted to about 4 to about 12 to achieve the desired reaction rate. After the adjustment of the pH generally the amount of monoreacted amide/amine is optimum for the given ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine and the amount of direacted amide/amine is low. The rate of viscosity increase is monitored during the reaction using a Brookfield viscometer. A viscosity increase of 0.5 cps indicates an increase in polymer molecular weight and an increase in the amount of direacted amide/amine. The amount of monoreacted amide/amine is generally maintained during the viscosity increase but the amount of direacted amide/amine increases with viscosity. Generally, the desired viscosity increase corresponds to a desired level of monoreacted amide/amine, direacted amide/amine and molecular weight. The rate of reaction depends on the temperature, total concentration of polymer and aldehyde, the ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine functional groups and pH. Higher rates of glyoxylation are expected when the temperature, total concentration of polymer and aldehyde, the ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine functional groups or pH is increased. The rate of reaction can be slowed down by decreasing the total concentration of polymer and aldehyde, temperature, the ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine functional groups or pH (to between about 2 to about 3.5). The amount of unreacted aldehyde at the end of the reaction increases as the ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine functional groups is increased. However, the total amount of monoreacted and direacted amide/amine becomes larger.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, reaction of a 95/5 mole percent diallyldimethylammonium chloride/acrylamide copolymer with glyoxal in a molar ratio of 0.4 to 1 glyoxal to acrylamide results in a 95/5 mole percent acrylamide/DADMAC copolymer with about 15 to 23 mole percent monoreacted and direacted acrylamide and with about 60 to 70 mole percent total unreacted glyoxal at the target product viscosity and molecular weight. A molar ratio of 0.8 to 1 glyoxal to acrylamide results in a 95/5 mole percent acrylamide/DADMAC copolymer with about 22 to 30 mole percent monoreacted and direacted acrylamide and with about 70 to 80 mole percent total unreacted glyoxal at the target product viscosity and molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The product shelf stability depends on the storage temperature, product viscosity, total amount of reacted amide/amine, total concentration of polymer and aldehyde, the ratio of aldehyde to amide/amine functional groups and pH. Generally, the pH of the product is maintained at a low pH (2 to 3.5) and the total concentration of polymer and aldehyde is optimized to extend shelf stability.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The reaction conditions are selected such that at least about 15 mole percent, preferably at least about 20 mole percent of the amino or amido groups in the polymer react with the aldehyde to form the aldehyde-functionalized polymer.

Recycle board grades using OCC (old corrugated containers) with or without mixed waste have been particularly responsive.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Useful increases in dewatering can be achieved with aldehyde-functionalized polymer doses in the range 0.05 to 15.0 lb polymer/ton of dry fiber with best results normally achieved in the range 0.5 to 3.0 lb/ton depending on the particular papermaking circumstances (papermachine equipment and papermaking raw materials used).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The aldehyde functionalized polymers of the invention can be added in traditional wet end locations used for conventional wet end additives. These include to thin stock or thick stock. The actual wet end location is not considered to be critical, but the aldehyde-functionalized polymers are preferably added prior to the addition of other cationic additives. Because the aldehyde-functionalized polymers are believed to act as pressing aids, their addition to the wet end is not necessary, and the option of adding them just prior to the press section after the formation of the sheet can also be practiced. For example, the polymer can be sprayed on the wet web prior to entering the press section, and this can be a preferred mode of addition to reduce dosages or the effects of interferences which might occur in the wet end. Other traditional wet end additives can be used in combination with the aldehyde functionalized polymers. These include retention aids, strength additives such as starches, sizing agents, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When using aldehyde-functionalized polymers as described herein having net anionic charge, a method of fixing the polymer to the fiber is needed. This fixing is typically accomplished by using cationic materials in conjunction with the polymers. Such cationic materials are most frequently coagulants, either inorganic (e.g. alum, polyaluminum chlorides, iron chloride or sulfate, and any other cationic hydrolyzing salt) or organic (e.g. p-DADMACs, EPI/DMAs, PEIs, modified PEIs or any other high charged density low to medium molecular weight polymers). Additionally, cationic materials added for other purposes like starch, wet strength, or retention additives can also serve to fix the anionic polymer. No additional additives are needed to fix cationic aldehyde-functionalized polymers to the filler.</p>

The Brookfield viscosity is monitored and upon achieving the desired viscosity increase of greater than or equal to 1 cps (5 to 200 cps, &#x3e;100,000 g/mole) the pH of the reaction mixture is decreased to 2 to 3.5 by adding sulfuric acid (93%) to substantially decrease the reaction rate. The rate of viscosity increase is dependent on the reaction pH and temperature. The higher the pH of the reaction mixture the faster the rate of viscosity increase. The rate of viscosity increase is controlled by decreasing the pH of the reaction mixture. The product is a clear to hazy, colorless to amber, fluid with a Brookfield viscosity greater than or equal to 5 cps. The resulting product is more stable upon storage when the Brookfield viscosity of the product is less than 40 cps and when the product is diluted with water to lower percent actives. The product can be prepared at higher or lower percent total actives by adjusting the desired target product viscosity. NMR analysis of the samples prepared indicate that about 70 to 80% of the glyoxal is unreacted and 15 to 35 mole percent of the acrylamide units reacted with glyoxal to from monoreacted and direacted acrylamide.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Dewatering Effectiveness of Representative Aldehyde-Functionalized Polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The dewatering effects of glyoxalated DADMAC/Acrylamide polymers prepared with glyoxal to acrylamide mole ratios (here after referred to as the G/A ratio) of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 are evaluated through paper machine trials. The relative performance of polymers prepared using the 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8 G/A ratios are compared to the polymer prepared with the 0.4 mole ratio. The trials are run on a dual headbox Fourdrinier papermachine using 100% OCC furnish manufacturing recycle linerboard and corrugating medium. Actual papermachine conditions varied depending on the specific grade of paperboard being made. In all cases, a retention program of polyaluminum chloride fed to the thick stock and a cationic flocculant fed to the thin stock is used. For linerboard grades, ASA sizing fed to the thin stock is also present. The glyoxalated acrylamide polymers are applied through a spray boom to the underside of the top ply prior to meshing with the bottom ply, although earlier trials demonstrated the dewatering effect could also be achieved by wet-end thick or thin stock addition.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The dewatering effect of the polymers is evaluated on the basis of steam pressure changes in the machine dryer section which are provided through the mills DCS (distributive control system) computer system. The sheet moisture at the reel is measured on-line and is maintained by adjustment of the steam pressure (a measure of steam usage or energy consumption). Lower sheet moisture at the reel reflects a lower sheet moisture going into the dryer section or equivalently, better dewatering through the machine sections preceding the dryer section. The lower steam demand, as measured by pressure, then reflects improved dewatering. If the steam pressure in these sections drops to a level where the operator feels comfortable that normal swings in steam demand can be handled, then he will increase the machine speed manually. When changes in polymer type or dose are made, the steam pressure from one of the steam sections is followed closely to see if any change occurs, with proper consideration given to changes in production rates when they occur. The initial effect of a drier sheet is observed by lower percent moisture detected at the reel. However, this drop in percent moisture is short lived because of the automatic regulation leaving only the steam reduction as a permanent reminder of any dewatering effect produced. Many factors other than addition of the aldehyde-functionalized polymer also affect the sheet moisture, but most, like stock changes, occur over a longer time frame than the steam reduction effect caused by the polymer additive, particularly when applied on the table through spray application. Consequently, the steam reduction is a better indicator of polymer dewatering than the average production rate or machine speed, as these measures are more easily confounded with the other factors which effect machine speed.</p>

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Comparison of Polymer with a 0.1 G/A Ratio with Polymer Having a 0.4 G/A Ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Comparison of these two polymers is conducted on 42 lb linerboard in the absence of wet-end starch. After a baseline is established with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer at 2.0 lb/ton, the 0.1 G/A ratio polymer is substituted at 2.2 lb/ton. Almost immediately, the sheet at the reel is consistently observed to be wetter and the steam demand increases to maximum in about 1 hr which necessitates the re-introduction of the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer to prevent slowing down the paper machine. To regain control of the machine, 3 lb/ton of the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer is needed, and its addition results in a dramatic reduction in steam pressure, 12 psi in 15 min. Subsequently, a baseline with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer is reestablished at 2 lb/ton whereupon substitution with 0.1 G/A ratio polymer at the higher dose of 3.4 lb/ton is initiated. At this much higher dose, the steam pressure progressively increases over a period of about an hour again to the point where it becomes necessary to revert back to the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer to prevent slowing the machine. Again, with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer added at 3.0 lb/ton the steam pressure is quickly reduced, 12 psi in 15 min. and this reduction could be maintained even when the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer's dose is reduced to 2 lb/ton. The 0.1 G/A ratio polymer could not maintain the steam pressure, and therefore the machine speed, achieved by 0.4 G/A ratio polymer even at a dose 70% higher. No change in the strength specifications for this grade (Mullen and Scott bond) could be detected when the 0.1 G/A ratio polymer is substituted for the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Comparison of Polymer with a 0.2 G/A Ratio with Polymer Having a 0.4 G/A Ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Comparison of these two polymers is conducted on 35 lb linerboard with 5 lb/ton wet-end starch fed to the thick stock. After a baseline is established with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer at 2.0 lb/ton, the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer is substituted at 2.2 lb/ton. At this dosage, a modest increase in steam pressure of 5 psi is measured over a period of about the hour. Reintroduction of the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer resulted in an immediate decrease in reel moisture and a quick decline in steam pressure of 3 psi in 10 min. Switching back to the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer at 2.2 lb/ton at this point keeps the steam reasonably constant for about an hour with only a 2 psi increase. Again, reintroduction of 2 lb of the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer results in a quick decline in steam pressure of 8 psi in 20 min. indicative of improve dewatering. Based on these results, the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer certainly demonstrates dewatering ability, but even at a 10% increase in dosage, it could not maintain the pressure achievable with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer. Additionally, unlike the 0.1 G/A ratio polymer, the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer is capable of keeping the machine running at the desired speed although at increased steam demand and dosage relative to the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer. The trial results with these three polymers indicated that the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer gives better dewatering than the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer and it in turn gives better dewatering than the 0.1 G/A ratio polymer. No change in the strength specifications for this grade (STFI) could be detected when the 0.2 G/A ratio polymer is substituted for the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer.</p>

<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Comparison of Polymer with a 0.8 G/A Ratio with Polymer having a 0.4 G/A Ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Based on the discovery that increasing the G/A ratio in the preparation of the polymers increases dewatering, an even higher G/A ratio of 0.8 is prepared and evaluated on the same papermachine. Comparison of the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer with the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer is conducted on 33 lb corrugating medium in the absence of wet-end starch. Addition of the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer at 2.0 lb/ton results in a very good reduction in steam pressure of 21 psi after about 2 hours at which time 1.5 lb/ton of the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer replaces the 2 lb/ton of 0.4 G/A ratio polymer. Even with the 25% reduction in dose, the addition of the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer results in an even further reduction in steam pressure by 3 psi and a dramatic increase in steam pressure of 12 psi occurs in 0.5 hour when it is removed. Further trialing is conducted on 26 lb corrugating medium in the absence of wet-end starch. Starting again with 2.0 lb/ton of 0.4 G/A ratio polymer to establish the baseline, a substitution of 2.0 lb/ton of 0.8 G/A ratio polymer results in a drop in steam pressure of 7 psi in 60 min., which further decreases by 4 psi when the dosage is increased to 3 lb/ton in 10 min. Reducing the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer to only 1.0 lb/ton relative to the 3 lb/ton results in an increase in steam pressure, but it remains 8 psi below the 2.0 lb/ton 0.4 G/A ratio polymer value even with an increase in machine speed of 30 ft/min. Based on these trial results the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer appears to yield equivalent dewatering at a dose 25 to 50% less than required by the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer. The strength specification for both medium grades (Concorra) made with the 0.8 G/A ratio polymer exhibit values equal to or greater than those obtained with for the 0.4 G/A ratio polymer even though the dosages are generally lower.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Based on these trial results, increasing the G/A ratio in the preparation of the aldehyde-functionalized polymers is found to provide increased dewatering activity with the preferred ratio being greater than 0.4.</p>
