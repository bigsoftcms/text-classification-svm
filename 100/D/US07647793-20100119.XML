<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device for selectively knitting reverse and face stitches using the needles of a common needle bed comprising a plurality of parallel tricks in which the needles slide.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order selectively to knit face stitches and reverse stitches, the knitting yarn is transferred from the needles of one bed to those of the other bed. However, this can only be done if the needles of both beds intersect, which is normally the case.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">If tubular knitted fabric is to be produced without sewing on a machine of this type, notably with the help of a rectilinear machine, it can only be done by knitting a single yarn alternating between one bed and the other, which makes the efficiency of such a solution unacceptable from an economical point of view.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,012 has proposed a solution to this problem, but the proposed solution is only capable of knitting face stitches.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to overcome this limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this purpose the present invention relates to a device for selectively knitting reverse and face stitches on the needles of a common needle bed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The proposed solution is therefore a valuable addition to the machine for knitting seamless tubular fabrics as proposed in the abovementioned patent.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a composite double needle belonging to the device for knitting face stitches and reverse stitches selectively. This double needle comprises a first needle <b>1</b> and a second needle <b>2</b>. These two needles <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are elongate and are formed through two flat stems mounted coplanar in one of the usual parallel tricks <b>4</b> of a bed <b>3</b> of a knitting machine as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The stem of the needle <b>1</b> is mounted in the bottom of the trick <b>4</b> and is the inner stem, while the stem of the second needle <b>2</b> which slides on the stem of the first needle <b>1</b> is the outer stem. In the case of the present invention, the tricks are however deeper than normal because they have to guide the double needle.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The upper end or first end of each needle stem <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> ends in a hook <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, respectively. In the embodiment illustrated, the two hooks <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are face to face. When they are in the relative positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base of the hook <b>5</b> of the inner stem forms, with the final edge of the first end of the outer stem <b>2</b>, a slope <b>7</b> on which the loop can slide, as will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On one of the faces of the needle stem <b>2</b>, close to its first end, is a displacing element <b>9</b> for pushing the loop of yarn away from the stem of the needle, for a purpose which will be explained later. This displacing element <b>9</b> is formed by a spring wire, one end of which is fixed while its other end can pass into a hole made through the stem of the needle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each needle stem <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> has two parallel parts <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, respectively, connected by a dogleg <b>1</b><i>c</i>, <b>2</b><i>c </i>respectively. The purpose of this is to make the upper part of the needle bed thin enough to reduce the spacing between this needle bed and the parallel needle bed (which is not shown) when forming a tubular knit in order to keep the transition between the fabrics knitted on the two beds as nearly invisible as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At their respective second ends, the stems <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> each have a butt <b>1</b><i>d</i>, <b>2</b><i>d</i>, respectively, on each of which an activator <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> respectively pivots in the plane of the trick <b>4</b>. Each activator <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> has two arms designed to engage alternately with two control cams <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> respectively of the needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>. These cams <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> are mounted on a carriage <b>17</b> connected to normal drive means (not shown) so that it can be moved in a direction perpendicular to the cutting plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. A selector <b>16</b>, mounted so as to slide in the trick <b>4</b>, has two cam grooves <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) each engaged with a pin projecting laterally from each of the activators <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. The selector <b>16</b> is moved between its two positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> by a selection mechanism (not shown), thus placing the arms of the actuators alternately in engagement with the cams <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, respectively, depending on whether face or reverse stitches are to be knitted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The knitting device according to the invention also comprises a pair of jacks (sinkers), one <b>18</b> of which is the main jack (loop holding sinkers) while the other <b>19</b> is the auxiliary jack (loop clearing sinker). This pair is formed of two adjacent strips. Each pair of 30 jacks is associated with each composite double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>. The main jack <b>18</b> is adjacent to one of the two large faces of the double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and passes to the right of the latter when viewing the needle bed <b>3</b> from the needle side. One of the two large faces of the <b>35</b> auxiliary jack <b>19</b> is placed against one of the large faces of the main jack <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). At its forward end, the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> has a part <b>19</b><i>c </i>which is separated from the adjacent face of the main jack <b>18</b> but still parallel to this adjacent face. At the same time, the width of the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> decreases toward its forward end, forming a slope <b>19</b><i>d</i>. At its forward end, the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> comes back into <b>5</b> contact with the adjacent face of the main jack <b>18</b>. This parallel part <b>19</b><i>c </i>is connected both to the strip of the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> and to its forward end, by two parts <b>19</b><i>e </i>which are inclined relative to the plane of the strip. This part <b>19</b><i>c </i>of the auxiliary jack thus <b>10</b> forms a channel through which the inner needle <b>1</b> can pass, as will be seen later.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As can be seen more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a</i>, the forward end of the slope <b>19</b><i>d </i>of the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> also has a bearing element <b>19</b><i>f </i>bent at 90&#xb0; to the plane of the strip forming the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> to come under the thickness of the strip of the main jack <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">These jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are mounted so as to slide at right angles to the direction of movement of the needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, through a holder <b>20</b> which is mounted on the needle bed <b>3</b> and on which a yarn guide <b>31</b> is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, each pair of jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> passes through a rectangular-section opening <b>21</b>, the width of which corresponds to the distance between two composite double needles. This is why the rectangular-section openings <b>21</b> through which the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> pass are distributed alternately in two rows, an upper and a lower, within the holder <b>20</b>. The remaining unoccupied space between the thicknesses of the two jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and the edges of the rectangular-section opening <b>21</b> parallel to these jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is occupied by two of the four shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>which belong to each pair of jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. These shims can be moved between two positions, in one of which it is engaged in and in the other disengaged from the rectangular-section opening <b>21</b>, thus allowing the three combinations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> respectively, which correspond to three positions of the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> relative to the rectangular-section opening <b>21</b>. These shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>thus allow a loop to be transferred from one composite double needle to another in order to make decreases. This transfer takes place between the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>j</i>-<b>9</b><i>k. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, each jack <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> has a pivot element <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>a</i>. The distance between the pivot elements <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the jacks of the upper row and the holder <b>20</b> is greater than between this same holder <b>20</b> and the pivot elements <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the jacks of the lower row. This is due to the fact that the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> of the upper row are longer than those of the lower row. This difference in length is intended to prevent interference between adjacent pairs of jacks when the jacks are moved laterally by the shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A series of cams J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b> is laid out on a surface of the carriage <b>17</b>, this surface being perpendicular to the needle bed <b>3</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>. Cams J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b> are for sliding the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> of the lower row and cams J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b> those of the upper row according to the type of stitch being knitted. Cams P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> are for sliding the four shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>of the lower row and cams P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b> the four shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>of the upper row.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The selective connection between the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and the cams J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b>, on the one hand and between the shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>on the other is created by a series of see-saws <b>24</b>, <b>27</b> respectively, only two of which <b>24</b> and <b>27</b> are illustrated to keep the drawing clear. Each of these see-saws <b>24</b>, <b>27</b> has an element at one end capable of being selectively engaged or not in respective cam tracks J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b> for the jacks depending on whether or not the jack is to be moved to form the desired type of stitch. To selectively engage the see-saws <b>24</b> with the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> with their respective cams, each see-saw is subjected on the one hand to the force of a return spring <b>25</b> which tends to engage it with the cam J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b> associated with the corresponding jack <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and on the other hand to an actuating member <b>26</b> in the form of a sliding wedge controlled by control means (not shown) in order to pivot it in opposition to the force of the return spring <b>25</b>, depending on the type of stitch to be knitted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The selective movement of the shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>is based on the same principle as that of the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, three possible movements with the aid of the four cams must be possible, whereas only two cams P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> are designed to slide the four shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>of the lower row and two cams P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b> the four shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>of the upper row.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To solve this problem, one possible way is to fit a see-saw <b>27</b> on the two shims <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c </i>adjacent to the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. These see-saws <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>c</i>) are similar to the see-saws <b>24</b> connected to the jacks, but the width of their end designed to engage in the cam tracks of the respective cams P<b>1</b>-P<b>4</b> extends across two adjacent shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>respectively. This end has a recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>designed to take one of the projections <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>d </i>connected to the shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>adjacent to the shims <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c </i>respectively, on which the see-saws <b>27</b> are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As in the case of the see-saws <b>24</b> associated with the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, these see-saws <b>27</b> are subjected on the one hand to the force of a return spring <b>29</b> which tends to place this see-saw <b>27</b> in engagement with that one of the cams P<b>1</b>-P<b>4</b> to which it is linked, and on the other hand to an actuating member <b>30</b> controlled by control means (not shown) for pivoting it against the force of the return spring <b>29</b>, according to the type of stitch to be knitted. Unlike the actuating member <b>26</b> of the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, the actuating member <b>30</b> of the shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>can occupy three positions which are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>14</b><i>c </i>respectively. When the actuating member <b>30</b> is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>, only shim <b>22</b><i>b </i>or shim <b>22</b><i>c </i>connected to a see-saw <b>27</b> is driven: shims <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>d </i>adjacent to shims <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>respectively are not driven because of the fact that the level of the recesses <b>27</b><i>a </i>at one of the ends of the see-saws <b>27</b> is now situated below the level of the projections <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>d</i>. When the actuating member <b>30</b> is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>, the end of the see-saw <b>27</b> is still engaged in the track of one of the cams P<b>1</b>-P<b>4</b> and the recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>is then in engagement with a projection <b>28</b><i>a </i>or <b>28</b><i>d</i>, such that in this position each cam P<b>1</b>-P<b>4</b> controls the movement of two adjacent shims <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>of the upper row or of the lower row. Consequently, between the position of the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the jacks have been moved by a distance corresponding to the distance between two adjacent composite double needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> on the needle bed <b>3</b>, so that the jack <b>18</b> can now transfer a loop from one composite double needle to another adjacent composite double needle, allowing a decrease to be made. It should be realized that this ability to decrease is obviously an important feature of the present invention, but that it is only a preferred feature, and that the invention per se relates to the formation of two types of stitches on the same needle bed, which will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The knitting device of the present invention having now been described sufficiently to enable a person skilled in the art to see how its various component parts can be actuated, we will now explain the various mechanisms which make it possible, using this device, selectively to knit face and reverse stitches on a common needle bed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>e </i>show the steps of forming a reverse stitch as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which shows what the observer marked O in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>sees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows the old loop <b>32</b> held between the hook <b>5</b> of the inner needle <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the comb <b>3</b><i>a </i>formed at the upper edge of the needle bed. The jack <b>18</b> is in its advanced position toward the needle bed <b>3</b>. In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>) the two needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> of the composite double needle have risen, causing the old loop <b>32</b> to slide down the slope <b>7</b> formed at the base of the hook <b>5</b> of the needle <b>1</b> and on the end of the needle <b>2</b>, until it is on the stem <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the needle <b>2</b>. The main jack remains in its advanced position and serves to prevent the old loop <b>32</b> rising with the needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>), the main jack <b>18</b> retreats and the yarn guide <b>31</b> places the yarn Y in the hook <b>5</b> of the inner needle <b>1</b>. Next (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>d</i>), the inner needle <b>1</b> descends until its hook <b>5</b> is in front of the hook <b>6</b> of the outer needle <b>2</b>. Finally, both needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> descend, pulling a loop <b>33</b> of yarn Y and causing the old loop <b>32</b> to ride up over the slope <b>7</b> of the outer needle <b>2</b>. This loop grips the loop <b>33</b> and passes onto the other side of the needle bed <b>3</b> through the teeth of the comb <b>3</b><i>a </i>formed by the upper edge of the needle bed <b>3</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>e</i>. The cycle described above can then repeat from the step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>. To knit a rib knit with one reverse stitch alternating with one face stitch, if two adjacent double needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> are observed, one of these double needles and its associated jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are operated through the sequences of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>l </i>and during this time the other adjacent double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and its associated jacks are operated through the sequences <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>e</i>, the movement between <b>8</b><i>d </i>and <b>8</b><i>e </i>being delayed to coincide with phases <b>9</b><i>g</i>-<b>9</b><i>j </i>of the other adjacent double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The formation of a face stitch will now be explained as viewed by the observer O in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a </i>with the help of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>l</i>. The starting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a </i>is practically the same as for a reverse stitch. To begin, the outer needle <b>2</b> rises, the yarn Y is placed on the jack <b>18</b> which retreats and pulls the yarn Y into the hook <b>6</b>. The outer needle <b>2</b> descends, pulling a loop of yarn <b>34</b> which is stretched between the needle and the main jack <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>c</i>). In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>d</i>), the main jack <b>18</b> is moved toward the rear and pulls the loop <b>34</b> in the hook <b>6</b>. The inner needle <b>1</b> rises until the base of the hook <b>5</b> is aligned with the loop-sliding slope <b>7</b> on the upper end of the needle <b>2</b>. In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>e</i>), both needles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> rise together. As the needles rise, the old loop <b>32</b> slides down that part of the hook <b>5</b> of the needle <b>1</b> which is in line with the loop-sliding slope <b>7</b>, until it is completely off the hook <b>5</b>. The double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> continues to rise until the old loop <b>32</b> catches the loop <b>34</b>, after which the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> is advanced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>f</i>), which causes the loop of yarn <b>34</b> to slide up its ramp <b>19</b><i>d </i>and off the main jack <b>18</b>. As a result, when it retreats, the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>g</i>) allows the old loop <b>32</b> to knock off the loop of yarn <b>34</b> that is to form the new loop against the stem <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the outer needle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At the end of the upward movement of the double needle <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, the main jack <b>18</b> is advanced toward the needle bed <b>3</b> between the outer needle <b>2</b> and the spacer element <b>8</b> and passes into the loop until the hook of the jack <b>18</b> closes the hook <b>6</b> and protects the loop during the descent of the hook <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>h</i>). The inner needle <b>1</b> then descends and the jack <b>18</b> advances (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>i</i>), allowing the loop <b>34</b> to slide along the main jack <b>18</b>. In the next step, the outer needle <b>2</b> moves back down (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>j</i>). Said outer needle <b>2</b> has a protrusion <b>2</b><i>e </i>to move the loop <b>34</b> away and protect it from the hook <b>6</b>. This descent of the needle <b>2</b> allows the old loop <b>32</b> to grip the new loop <b>34</b>. Depending on whether the loops are to be transferred, the jacks will be moved laterally toward the adjacent needle. The auxiliary jack <b>19</b> will then advance toward the needle bed <b>3</b>, causing the new loop <b>34</b> to slide along its slope <b>19</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>k</i>) and off the main jack <b>18</b> and the inner needle <b>1</b> moves up again, passing between the jacks <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> in the channel formed between the jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> by the part <b>19</b><i>c </i>of the auxiliary jack <b>19</b>. As it moves away from the needle bed <b>3</b>, the auxiliary jack allows the new loop <b>34</b> to slide along the slope <b>19</b><i>d </i>of the auxiliary jack <b>19</b> and be pulled by the old loop into the hook <b>5</b> of the inner needle <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>l</i>). The jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> move back into the starting position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Several variants may be envisioned as regards both the composite needle and their control as well as the control of the jacks. For example, the traditional control of knitting needles using cams could be replaced by other known controls, such as a linear motor, for example, described in EP 1 061 168.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As far as the knitting needles are concerned, a number of variants have been shown. Those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>correspond to the composite needle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> to which a third element <b>35</b> has been added to close the hook <b>6</b> of the outer needle <b>2</b>. This closing element <b>35</b> is controlled by a cam (not shown) on the carriage <b>17</b>, like cams <b>12</b>-<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>differs from the preceding variant in that the opening of the hook <b>6</b>&#x2032; of the outer needle <b>2</b>&#x2032; is not toward the inner needle <b>1</b> but opens on the opposite side. The opening of this hook <b>6</b>&#x2032; is also controlled by a closing element <b>35</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Lastly, the variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>differs essentially from the preceding variant in the shape of the hook <b>5</b>* of the inner needle <b>1</b>*, in the width of which the outer needle <b>2</b>* fits, so that the upper end of the outer needle <b>2</b>* can close or open the hook <b>5</b>* depending on its position relative to the inner needle <b>1</b>*.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In still another variant, the pairs of jacks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, which occur alternately in two rows of openings <b>21</b> with a spacing between adjacent openings of one row offset by a half interval relative to the openings of the other row, could also be distributed on more than two rows of offset openings.</p>
