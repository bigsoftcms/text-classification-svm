<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the filing benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/904,006 filed Feb. 28, 2007, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to bedding or seating products and, more particularly, to bedding mattresses.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The sewing of various components of a mattress together to form a finished product presents several sewing challenges. One such challenge is the sewing of the components at their respective corners. For example, pillow-top mattresses are constructed to appear as though a comforter or pillow has been placed on a conventional mattress to provide a more luxurious and comfortable appearance. The pillow-top is connected to the upper decking of the mattress by an intermediate gusset of folded material. Several different techniques are known to sew the edge of the pillow-top corners to corresponding corners of gusset so that the resulting sewn corners have a consistent and pleasing appearance. However, many of those techniques require various manual operations, and therefore, incorporating the gusset into pillow-top mattresses normally makes them more expensive to manufacture than conventional mattresses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to miter the gusset to form the gusset around a corner. With one system, the operator cuts an extended length of previously formed gusset material at measured locations where the corners of the cover are expected to be; and the mitered corner is formed on the gusset material before it is attached to the panel. However, due to the nature and construction of the mattress cover material and of the gusset material, often the gussets and panels shrink or change shape at different rates if left to sit, thus somewhat altering the location of the pre-mitered corner on the gusset material with respect to the corner on the mattress panel. This change occurs more frequently when the gusset is manufactured well in advance of the date of assembly of the mattress cover. Since the mitered corners on the gusset are not aligned precisely with the corners of the mattress cover panel, an accommodation has to be made by the operator at the time the gusset is attached to the mattress cover panel, such as by gathering the material or stretching where necessary to properly position the mitered corner. This adjustment results in extra operator time, as well as the possibility that the mitered corner is not properly positioned, or that the corner exhibits an uneven or undesired appearance. Even where the operator is able to properly position the mitered corner, the required stretching or gathering of the material produces a mattress cover which does not have the desired look and which night not be acceptable to all purchasers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With another known system, a single machine is provided for making the gusset and for attaching the flange material. This machine folds the gusset, stitches it together in its folded condition, and secures the flange material to the gusset. The finished gusset is then cut into lengths and bound to a mattress panel. In conjunction with that operation, a mitering station is provided closely adjacent the binding machine. When it is desired to miter a corner of the gusset, as the operator approaches a corner of the mattress cover panel, the binding machine is stopped, and the operator measures exactly the distance from that point to the corner of the panel. An equivalent distance is marked on the gusset material. The operator then pulls that part of the gusset material over to the closely adjacent mitering station. The gusset material is first folded transversely at that point. Next, two stitches are applied by a sewing machine to the gusset from the folded edge inwardly. Each stitch is at a 45 degree angle with respect to the folded edge of the gusset, so that the stitches form a 90 degree angle with respect to each other. The sewing machine preferably is preprogrammed to stitch precisely the desired number of stitches needed for the miter. All the operator must do is wait until the stitches have completed, rotate the gusset material through 90 degrees and start the machine again. Thereafter, the triangular section defined by the stitches and the folded edge is cut out of the gusset material either automatically, or manually, and the gusset material is removed from the mitering station. While more automated, the above operation still requires numerous steps by the operator to form a corner during the process of attaching the gusset to another piece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,834,603 discloses a system used to attach a gusset of an upper deck of a mattress like the one shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,815. However, in such a mattress the ruffled gusset must be attached to the border panel, the pillow-top and lastly to the upper deck of the mattress. These multiple sewing steps are time consuming, increase the chance of operator error and increase the cost of the resulting product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for an improved process for reliably manufacturing a pillow-top mattress and the apparatus to implement the process.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention which fulfills this need comprises a system for manufacturing a seating or bedding product and methods of using the system. In one embodiment, the system may be used to manufacture a one-sided pillow-top mattress. Such a mattress has a casing or bucket inside which is secured a spring core or its equivalent using flange material. The casing is covered with a cover sewn onto what is known in the industry as a gusset located around the perimeter of the mattress, the gusset being ruffled at the corners of the mattress. The casing further comprises a bottom panel and a side panel known in the industry as a border. The bottom panel is common made of a non-skid type of material but may be made of any material. Such a mattress may be manufactured more quickly and efficiently than prior art pillow-top mattresses because a mattress manufactured accordance with the present invention does not require the gusset to be sewn to an inner panel in multiple locations. The novel ruffled pillow-top mattress of this invention eliminates the need for an inner panel or upper deck, attaches the flange material to the gusset for support provided by the inner panel in prior art mattresses and ruffles the flange material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect of this invention, the system comprises multiple sewing stations or modules, each one of which has at least one sewing machine or head. The first sewing station comprises a first and second sewing table, each supported by a base having legs. Each sewing table has its own sewing machine. At the upstream end of the first sewing station, a roll support is adapted to support a roll of border material and another roll support is adapted to support a roll of gusset material. Each roll support is supported by a frame upstream of the first sewing table. However, the roll supports may be attached to any component or portion of the first module or alternatively, be stand alone components.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first sewing station further comprises a plurality of guide bars used to guide the webs of border and gusset material to the first sewing machine. Some of the guide bars have adjustable side guides which enable the module or stewing station to be used with different widths of gusset and/or border material. The guides are used to align common edges of the webs of gusset and border material prior to such webs being sewn together along a first seam, the unticked surfaces of such webs contacting each other. The gusset web is located above the border web, the tick side of the border web facing down and the tick side of the gusset web facing up. Kevlar thread may be used in any of the sewing machines of the system. A tape holder is secured to the first sewing table and is adapted to hold a roll of sewing tape which is folded by a binder into a generally U-shape and placed around the aligned edges of the webs of border and gusset material prior to the webs being sewn together with the first seam by the first sewing machine. Thus, the first seam has a tape edge which is visible around the perimeter of the mattress when the manufacturing process is over.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">First and second pullers, each driven by a servo motor, are secured to the first sewing table. Each puller comprises a pair of rotatable wheels which grip the webs of material and pull them to their desired location at a desired speed. The first puller is located upstream of the first sewing machine and the second puller is located downstream of the first sewing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first sewing station further comprises a first opener secured to the first sewing table which comprises a metal plate used to separate or open the webs of border and gusset material joined with the first seam. The first opener makes the webs of border and gusset material generally coplanar which exposes the other edge of the gusset material and enables a first web of flange material to be secured to this exposed edge of the web of gusset material at the second sewing table of the first sewing station or module. In this position, the webs of gusset and border material may be considered in an open position or condition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After being opened, the combined and opened webs of border and gusset material are pulled over an idle roller secured to the upstream portion of the second sewing table by a third puller attached to the second sewing table downstream of the second sewing machine or head. This opened web combination is then pulled past a second sewing machine located on the second sewing table which makes a second seam. A holder for a roll of flange material is secured to the second sewing table, as is a flange folder. The flange folder changes the direction of a first web of flange material as it comes off the roll so the first web of flange material flows or moves with the combined webs of border and gusset material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The second sewing machine sews the unrolled first web of flange material to the exposed edge of the web of gusset material to complete a border assembly web. In this condition, the first web of flange material lays on top of the web of gusset material, contacting the unticked side of the web of gusset material. This combination of webs is considered a border assembly web for purposes of this document. This border assembly web is rolled up in this condition. A third puller attached to the second sewing table pulls the border assembly web past the second sewing machine, over an idle roller at the downstream end of the second sewing table, over an end station downstream of the second sewing table and onto a motorized mechanism for rolling up the border assembly web.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The motorized mechanism for rolling up the border assembly web comprises motorized storage holder comprising a rotatable roller driven by a motor. Once a roll of border assembly web has been formed and the roll holder is full, the border assembly web is cut and the roll moved to the second sewing station or module of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The second sewing station or module comprises a roll holder mounted on a frame upstream of a sewing table. This non-motorized roll holder is adapted to receive and retain the roll of the web of border assembly from the first sewing station. A pair of guides are incorporated into the station to guide the unrolled border assembly web into a puller driven by a motor which is secured to the frame upstream of the sewing table. The puller pulls the web over an idle roller secured to the upstream edge of the sewing table and past a marker which is used to mark the unticked surface or side of the web of border material. The puller pulls the unrolled web past a sewing machine which sews the first web of flange material to the web of gusset material along a third seam spaced inwardly from aligned edges of the webs of gusset and flange material. In this manner, the first web of flange material is further joined to the web of gusset material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This third sewing machine of the system (the only one at the second station) has a ruffler which ruffles the first web of flange material and the web of gusset material at predetermined locations based on input received from an encoded mounted on the upstream side of the sewing table. This encoder additionally functions to send a signal to a marker which marks the unticked side of the web of border material at predetermined locations based on the length of material which has passed the encoder. A cutter assembly is located at the end of this second sewing station or module for cutting the ruffled and marked border assembly web to create a border assembly piece of a predetermined length. The cutter assembly includes a blade protected with a safety cage.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The third sewing station or module of the system comprises a sewing table on which is located another sewing machine, the fourth sewing machine of the system. This sewing machine is used to create a border assembly loop by sewing the ends of the border assembly piece together. A plurality of thread holders are mounted on a mounting assembly secured to the sewing table. A mitering table is also mounted to the sewing table for use in alternative embodiments, such as when a continental appearance is desired on the bottom surface of a mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One method of manufacturing a casing for use in the manufacture of a bedding or seating product using the system of this invention comprises first sewing the web of border material to the web of gusset material along a first seam using the first sewing machine of the first sewing station. A piece of tape may be incorporated in this first seam to create a tape edge.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second sewing machine of the first module is used to sew a first web of flange material to the web of gusset material along a second seam, the first web of flange material overlaying the web of gusset material while the second seam is being sewn. The combined webs of border and gusset material in combination with the first web of flange material make up an unfinished or unruffled border assembly web which is rolled up at the end of the first module or station of the system, the ticked sides of the webs of flange and border material facing outwardly in one embodiment. However, the assembly may be rolled up in any desired configuration with either side facing out.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At the second sewing station or module, a third sewing machine is used to sew the first web of flange material and the web of gusset material along a longitudinally extending third seam spaced inwardly from the second seam. This third sewing machine is also used to ruffle the webs of flange and gusset material at predetermined positions to complete the border assembly web.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At the second sewing station or module, the border assembly web, and more particularly, the unticked side of the web of border material is marked at predetermined locations to aid in sewing a bottom panel of the casing to the border assembly loop at the fourth and last station or module of the system. An encoder secured to the sewing table at the second sewing station is used to help the ruffler operate at the correct locations (at the corners of the casing) and ruffle the webs of flange and gusset material at predetermined locations. After being marked and ruffled with the third sewing machine, the ruffled border assembly web is cut to a predetermined length to create a marked and ruffled border assembly piece. The encoder sends a signal to a controller which operates a cutter assembly for cutting the ruffled and marked border assembly web at the correct predetermined location to create a piece of the proper length for a select size mattress, for example a queen size mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At the third sewing station or module, the ends of the border assembly piece are sewn together to create a border assembly loop. Before sewing begins, an operator aligns marks on the border assembly piece so that the correct size casing will be made.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the fourth sewing station or module, a bottom panel is sewn to the border assembly loop. At this last station or module, a second web of flange material may be inserted between the border assembly loop and the bottom panel to create a lower flange inside the mattress casing. Tape is introduced and formed to surround the aligned edges of the bottom panel, the second web of flange material and the border assembly loop prior to a seam being sewn. The result is an exposed tape edge around the perimeter of the mattress at the lower edge of the mattress casing and resultant mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the bottom panel has been secured to the border assembly loop of the casing, a spring, foam or equivalent core is inserted inside the interior of the casing and covered with one or more layers of padding such as foam or fiber pads. Lastly, a top piece is secured to the upper exposed edge of the casing and more particularly, the upper edge of the gusset to complete a one-sided pillow-top mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In summary, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a casing for use in the manufacture of a bedding or seating product, comprising the following steps: 1) sewing a web of border material to a web of gusset material along a first seam; 2) sewing a first web of flange material to the web of gusset material along a second seam, the first web of flange material overlaying the web of gusset material while the second seam is being sewn; 3) sewing the first web of flange material and the web of gusset material along a longitudinally extending third seam spaced inwardly from the second seam; 4) ruffling the webs of flange and gusset material at predetermined positions to complete a border assembly web; 5) cutting the border assembly web to a predetermined length to create a border assembly piece; 6) sewing the ends of the border assembly piece together to create a border assembly loop; and 7) sewing a bottom panel to the border assembly loop.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another summary of the method of manufacturing a casing for use in the manufacture of a mattress is as follows: 1) at a first sewing station: sewing a first web of border material to a web of gusset material along a first seam using a first sewing head and sewing a first web of flange material to the web of gusset material along a second seam using a second sewing head downstream of the first sewing head, the web of flange material overlaying the web of gusset material; 2) at a second sewing station remote from the first sewing station: sewing the webs of flange and gusset material along a longitudinally extending third seam spaced inwardly from the second seam using a third sewing head; ruffling the webs of flange and gusset material at predetermined positions to complete a border assembly web and cutting the border assembly web to a predetermined length to create a border assembly piece; 3) at a third sewing station remote from the first and second sewing stations: sewing the ends of the border assembly piece together along a fourth seam to create a border assembly loop using a fourth sewing head; and 4) at a fourth sewing station remote from the first and second sewing stations: sewing a bottom panel to the border assembly loop along a fifth seam using a fifth sewing head.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention includes a method of manufacturing a bedding or seating product comprising the following steps: 1) sewing a web of border material to a web of gusset material proximate aligned edges of the webs; 2) sewing a first web of flange material to the web of gusset material along an edge of the gusset material oppose the edge of the gusset material joined to the border material to create a three piece web, the web of flange material overlaying the web of gusset material; 3) sewing the webs of flange and gusset material along a longitudinally extending seam spaced inwardly from the sewn edges of the webs of flange and gusset material, the sewing including ruffling the webs of flange and gusset material at predetermined positions to complete a border assembly web; 4) cutting the border assembly web to a predetermined length to create a border assembly piece; 5) sewing the ends of the border assembly piece together to create a border assembly loop; 6) sewing a bottom panel to the border assembly loop to complete a casing; 7) inserting a spring core into the casing; 8) laying padding materials over the spring core; and 9) sewing a top panel to an outer edge of the gusset material of the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an another aspect of the invention, a box top mattress may by manufactured using the system. The first sewing station further comprises a roll holder adapted to receive and retain a roll of box top border material. A web of box top border is pulled off the roll and attached at the second sewing table by the second sewing machine to the web of gusset material simultaneously with the first web of flange material. Commonly a web of tape is using for this sewing operation to create a tape edge around the mattress where the box top border meets the upper edge of the gusset with a seam sewn by the second sewing machine. After the web of box top border and first web of flange material are secured to the web of gusset material using the second sewing machine, the web of box top border lays on top of the first web of flange material which lays on top of the web of gusset material. In combination with the web of border material, the assembly comprises a closed or unopened border assembly web. This unopened border assembly web is pulled by a third puller attached to the second sewing machine past a second opener attached to the second sewing table which opens the unopened border assembly web so that the webs of border, gusset and box top material are all generally coplanar. This opened border assembly web including a web of box top material is then rolled up by the motorized storage holder in an open condition or position as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One advantage of this system is that it provides flexibility to quickly repair one or more components of the system without shutting down the entire sewing operation. One or more of the modules may be replaced with another like module and the system continue to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">These and other objects and advantages of this invention will be more readily apparent from the following drawings, in which:</p>

If a mitered corner is needed the operator will find the corner mark and fold the material on the mark and sew/trim the material off using one of the miter guide lines on the sewing head.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, at the fourth sewing station or module <b>200</b>, the operator then takes the border assembly loop <b>248</b> which is turned inside out so now the unticked side <b>249</b> of the border assembly loop <b>248</b> is exposed. A roll <b>214</b> containing a second web of flange material <b>216</b> is put on roll holder <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 12</figref>. The second web of flange material <b>216</b> passes over bar <b>218</b> and is passed through flange folder <b>220</b> and inserted between the border assembly loop <b>248</b> and a generally rectangular piece of non-skid decking <b>250</b>. The border assembly loop <b>248</b> is suspended by loop holder <b>222</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the sewing machine <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The operator will match the corner of the non-skid decking <b>250</b> with a corner mark <b>288</b> on the border assembly loop <b>248</b>, more particularly on the unticked side <b>229</b> of the web of border material <b>56</b>. Then the sewing machine <b>204</b> sews the non-skid decking <b>250</b> to the border assembly loop <b>248</b> and second web of flange material <b>216</b> with a web of tape <b>282</b> in binder <b>282</b> to tape edge <b>258</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 18</figref>. The border assembly loop <b>248</b> is sewn around completely. The web of tape <b>282</b> is then cut and sewed back over. If the corners are mitered, the border is turned inside out. The corners are aligned and the backing is attached to the border then turned right side out.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> show a casing or bucket <b>252</b> made in accordance with the method described above on the system described above. The casing <b>252</b> comprises a bottom panel <b>250</b> made from non-skid material joined to a border or side panel <b>256</b> made from the web of border material <b>56</b> with a tape edge <b>258</b> around the perimeter of casing <b>252</b> sewn with fourth seam <b>260</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The fourth seam <b>260</b> also secures a lower flange <b>261</b> inside the casing <b>252</b> made from the second web of flange material <b>216</b>. The casing <b>252</b> further comprises a gusset <b>262</b> made from the web of gusset material <b>54</b> sewn to the top edge of the border panel <b>256</b> made from the web of border material <b>56</b> with first seam <b>234</b> and including an upper tape edge <b>264</b>. A second seam <b>236</b> joins the upper edge of the gusset <b>262</b> to an upper flange <b>266</b> made from the first web of flange material <b>100</b>. Third seam <b>268</b> further joins the upper flange <b>266</b> to the bend or mid-point of the gusset <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> after the casing <b>252</b> is completed, a spring core <b>270</b> is inserted into the interior of casing <b>252</b>. Although one type of spring core <b>270</b> is illustrated any other spring core may be used. Alternatively, a core having no springs, such as a foam core may be inserted into the interior of casing <b>252</b>. The upper and lower flanges <b>266</b>, <b>261</b> are secured to the spring core <b>270</b> with hog rings <b>267</b> or any other suitable way to prevent movement of the casing <b>252</b> relative to the spring core <b>270</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, once the spring core <b>270</b> is secured to the flanges <b>266</b>, <b>261</b>, suitable layers of padding <b>272</b>, such as foam or fiber, for example are placed over the spring core <b>270</b>. Lastly, a tape edge machine (not shown) is used to secure cover <b>274</b> to the upper edge <b>275</b> of the gusset <b>262</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> to complete a mattress <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to an alternative embodiment, a box top mattress <b>238</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may be manufactured. For the sake of simplicity, the same numbers will be used in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref> for the same parts as described above with regards to a non-box top mattress <b>300</b> but with a prime after the number. In the process of making box top mattress <b>238</b>, a web of box top border material <b>240</b> is rolled up into a roll, the roll being held by roll holder <b>242</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If such a mattress is desired, the second sewing machine <b>18</b>, while making the second seam <b>236</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) also attaches the web of box top border <b>240</b> to the exposed edge of the web of gusset material <b>54</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a web of tape <b>244</b> unwound from a tape roll holder is used in making the second seam <b>236</b>. The result is an upper tape edge <b>292</b> which extends the perimeter of the box top mattress <b>238</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If making a box top mattress <b>238</b>, opener <b>113</b> at the downstream end of the second sewing table <b>20</b> separates the web of box top border material <b>240</b> from the web of gusset material <b>54</b> so the unruffled border assembly <b>120</b>&#x2032; is in open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">While we have described only several embodiments of this invention, persons skilled in this art will appreciate that slightly different systems or machines may be utilized in the practice of this invention. Therefore, we do not intend to be limited except by the scope of the following appended claims.</p>
