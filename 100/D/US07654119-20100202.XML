<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the softener supplying part <b>406</b>, a softener siphon tube <b>409</b> is protruded, and the softener siphon tube <b>409</b> is covered with a softener siphon cap <b>409</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the prior art, the detergent supplying part <b>402</b>, bleach supplying part <b>404</b>, and softener supplying part <b>406</b> are arranged in the left and right direction and formed long in the front and rear direction, which causes the overall size of the drawer <b>400</b> to be greater, increases manufacturing cost, and makes it difficult to secure a space to install the drawer <b>400</b> in the commercial washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">By contrast, If the drawer <b>400</b> is formed small, the size of the detergent supplying part <b>402</b>, bleach supplying part <b>404</b>, and softener supplying part <b>404</b> becomes too small accordingly; there exist problems to cause insufficient accommodation amount of detergent, and fail to sufficiently secure the size of an input port for each of the detergent supplying part <b>402</b>, bleach supplying part <b>404</b>, and softener supplying part <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating another example of a drawer used in the conventional washing machine. A detergent supplying part <b>412</b> to house detergent is long provided in the front and rear direction at a right side of the drawer <b>410</b>. A bleach/softener supplying part <b>414</b> to separately house bleach and softener is long provided in the front and rear direction at a left side of the drawer <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bleach/softener supplying part <b>414</b> is provided with a box shaped bleach supplying part <b>416</b> at an inner and front part, and is provided with a box shaped softener supplying part <b>418</b> at an inner and rear part.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the bleach supplying part <b>416</b>, a bleach siphon tube <b>428</b> is protruded, and the bleach siphon tube <b>428</b> is covered with a bleach siphon cap <b>428</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the softener supplying part <b>418</b>, a softener siphon tube <b>429</b> is protruded, and the softener siphon tube <b>429</b> is covered with a softener siphon cap <b>429</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, in the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the prior art, the bleach supplying part <b>416</b> and softener supplying part <b>418</b> are arranged in the bleach/softener supplying part <b>414</b> to be spaced by each other in the front and rear direction, and thus, when softener is injected, the drawer <b>410</b> should be drawn until the bleach supplying part <b>416</b> and softener supplying part <b>418</b> are all open, causing the drawal distance of the drawer <b>410</b> to be greatly increased, which also makes the front and rear length of the drawer <b>410</b> greatly lengthened.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Although the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention is described with reference to the exemplary drawings, the invention is not limited to the embodiments and drawings set forth herein, rather it is limited only to the accompanying claims and many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention configured as above has effects as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, either of the softener supplying part and bleach supplying part is formed to be placed at a side and front of the other in the drawer, which allows for making the overall drawer compact while enlarging the size of the detergent supplying part, and allows softener and bleach to be injected while maintaining minimum drawn width of the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Moreover, in the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, each of the bleach supplying part and softener supplying part is formed so that the left and right width of its front side is greater than that of its rear side, which allows bleach and softener to be easily injected.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Besides, in the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, the overflowing parts are formed on the rear wall part of at least either of the bleach supplying part and softener supplying part, which have relatively lower height than the other parts of the rear wall part, and this allows for preventing bleach or softener from overflowing into other supplying part and making bleach or softener discharged through the rear wall side.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In addition, in the detergent supplying apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, the bleach siphon cap for covering the bleach siphon tube and softener siphon cap for covering the softener are formed together at the drawer cap, which allows for minimizing the number of parts and facilitating maintenance compared to a case where the bleach siphon cap and softener siphon cap are separately provided.</p>
