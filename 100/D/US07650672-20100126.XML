<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from German Patent Application No. 10 2005 009 159.8 dated Feb. 25, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an apparatus on a spinning preparation machine, for example, a flat card, draw frame or the like, for monitoring at least one sliver, having two rotating rollers that form a roller nip through which at least one sliver passes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Feeding of the sliver to the revolving plate of a can coiler is effected at the output of a flat card via take-off rollers. In a known apparatus, (DE 40 28 365 A), an optical sensor, which detects whether a fibre sliver is located in its field of vision or not, is arranged downstream of the take-off rollers. The sensor monitors the presence or absence of the sliver. Absence of the sliver is reported as a malfunction to a machine control. The sensor is arranged away from the roller nip at a distance from the take-off rollers. The optical path of the sensor runs perpendicular to the roller axles. The tension of the sliver changes at a distance from the take-off rollers, that is, the sliver sags to different depths. At relatively high and high sliver speeds, the sliver additionally oscillates parallel to the axles of the take-off rollers, that is, the sliver disappears from the optical path of the sensor, although no sliver funnel is present. Reliable monitoring of sliver breakage is not possible with the known apparatus. In addition, it is inconvenient that the spacing necessitates a separate holding device for the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an aim of the invention to produce an apparatus of the kind described initially that avoids or mitigates the said disadvantages, is in particular of simple construction and permits a reliable and trouble-free monitoring of sliver breakage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention provides an apparatus on a spinning preparation machine, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a pair of rotating rollers forming a nip through which at least one fibre sliver passes in use, each roller having a roller axle; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">a sensing arrangement defining an optical path in which the sliver can be monitored by the sensing arrangement;
<br/>
wherein the sensing arrangement is so arranged that the optical path extends, between the rollers, in a direction parallel to the axles of the rollers.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">Because the light beam of the sensor extends through the narrowing gap between the rollers, preferably close to the fibre material gripping point and parallel to the axles of the rollers, reliable sliver breakage monitoring can be ensured. In the narrowing gap between the rollers, especially at or in the region of the point of grip, there is a defined guidance of the fibre material, so interruption of the light beam of the sensor by the fibre material is at all times substantially certain. It is furthermore an advantage that the sensor can be mounted on holding or bearing elements that are already present, for example, for the take-off rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Advantageously, the monitoring arrangement comprises a non-contact sensor arrangement (sensor) that is capable of detecting unwanted sliver breakage. Advantageously, the rotating roller pair form a nip from which at least one sliver is discharged. In that case, it is preferred that the roller pair transfers the sliver to a downstream rotating roller pair. Preferably, the roller pair is part of a drafting system, for example, of a draw frame, or of a flat card drafting system. The fibre material may be present in, the form of a composite sliver comprising two or more slivers, or may instead be in the form of a single sliver. Advantageously, the optical path of the sensor is aligned in the direction of the working web of moving fibre material. Advantageously, the sensor is a sensor designed for non-contact sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Advantageously, the sensor is a photoelectric sensor, preferably a light sensor. Advantageously, the sensor is in the form of a reflex sensor. Advantageously, there is associated with the sensor a threshold value detector device, which, following a breakage of the sliver, responds to changes in the output signal of the sensor, preferably a photoreceptor of the photoelectric sensor, by emitting a breakage signal. Advantageously, the threshold value detector device signals a breakage in the sliver only when the exceeding or undershooting of its threshold value initiated by such a breakage continues uninterrupted for a predetermined duration. Advantageously, a display and/or switching device is controllable by the sensor. Preferably, recognition of sliver breakages is effected by means of optical sensors. Advantageously, the sensors are one-way photoelectric barriers with a highly focussed light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Advantageously, the photoelectric barriers are arranged parallel to the axles of the rollers. Advantageously, the photoelectric barriers use a laser beam as detection medium. Advantageously, the light is conducted to the monitoring points by means of light guides. Advantageously, pre-determined machine responses are initiated when a sliver breakage is recognised. Preferably, the responses are effected in dependence on plausibility controls. Preferably, a response is only initiated when the light beam is interrupted for a specific time. Advantageously, the intensity of the light beam emitted by the photoelectric barrier (transmitter) is adaptable to different criteria, for example, the production or the material. Advantageously, the sensitivity of the photoelectric barrier receiver can be adapted to different criteria, for example, the production or the material. Preferably, the sensitivity and/or intensity adjustments of the photoelectric barrier for different production conditions are stored and when conditions are the same are automatically recalled and can be used without manual intervention. As well as or instead of photoelectric barriers or other optical sensors, electronic cameras with illumination means may be used for detecting sliver breakage. The optical path of the sensor may advantageously run immediately adjacent to the peripheral surfaces in the wedge-shaped area of the rollers, or may advantageously run immediately adjacent to the grip line between the rollers. Advantageously, the optical path runs downstream of the roller pair in relation to the working direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Preferably, the optical sensor arrangement comprises a transmitter and a receiver. The optical sensor arrangement is advantageously mounted in a stationary holding device. Preferably, the holding device is provided in the region laterally of the roller pair. Preferably, the sensor arrangement is mounted on a framework or the like. Advantageously, the framework is of approximately C-shaped construction. Advantageously, the framework is of approximately forked construction. Advantageously, the framework is of approximately rectangular or square construction. In one embodiment, the sensor monitoring arrangement for sliver breakage and a sensor monitoring arrangement for fibre material build-up are present on the holding device. Advantageously, the sensor monitoring arrangement for sliver breakage is arranged on the holding device in the region between the shared tangents to the peripheral surfaces of the rollers. Advantageously, the optical path of the sensor monitoring arrangement runs parallel to the axle or axles of the roller pair. Advantageously, a shared electrical connection is present for the sensor arrangements for monitoring material build-up and for the sensor arrangement for monitoring sliver breakage. Advantageously, a shared electrical connection for the sensor arrangements is connected to an electrical evaluating arrangement. Advantageously, the evaluation of the electrical signals of the sensor arrangement for monitoring material build-up and of the sensor arrangement for monitoring sliver breakage may be carried out separately. The electrical signals may, having regard to hardware and/or software, be processable as an aggregate signal. The electronic signals may, having regard to hardware and/or software be processable in a single evaluation. Advantageously, on sliver breakage the optical path runs from the transmitter to the receiver. Advantageously, the transmitter and the receiver of the optical monitoring are arranged outside the end faces of the rollers. Advantageously, the transmitter and the receiver of the optical monitoring arrangement are arranged between the axles of the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">The invention also provides an apparatus on a spinning preparation machine, for example, a flat card, draw frame or the like, for monitoring at least one sliver, having two rotating rollers that form a roller nip through which at least one sliver passes, in which apparatus an optical monitoring arrangement (sensor) that monitors the presence of the sliver is provided in the vicinity of the rollers, characterised in that the sensor arrangement is arranged in the region between the shared tangents to the peripheral surfaces of the rollers, the tangents being arranged substantially perpendicular to the running direction of the sliver, and the optical path of the sensor runs parallel to the axles of the rollers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a card, for example, a flat card TC <b>03</b> (Trade Mark) made by Tr&#xfc;tzschler GmbH &#x26; Co. KG of M&#xf6;nchengladbach, Germany, has a feed roller <b>1</b>, feed table <b>2</b>, licker-ins <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c</i>, cylinder <b>4</b>, doffer <b>5</b>, stripping roller <b>6</b>, squeezing rollers <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, web-guide element <b>9</b>, web funnel <b>10</b>, take-off rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, revolving flat <b>13</b> with flat guide rollers and flat bars, can <b>15</b> and can coiler <b>16</b>. The directions of rotation of the rollers are shown by respective curved arrows. The letter M denotes the midpoint (axis) of the cylinder <b>4</b>. The reference numeral <b>4</b><i>a </i>denotes the clothing and <b>4</b><i>b </i>denotes the direction of rotation of the cylinder <b>4</b>. The arrow A denotes the working direction. A tuft feeder <b>17</b> is arranged upstream of the flat card. The coiling plate <b>19</b> is rotatably mounted in the delivery turntable block <b>18</b>. The coiling plate <b>19</b> comprises a sliver channel <b>20</b> having an entry and an exit (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for the sliver, and a rotary plate <b>21</b>. As shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a photoelectric barrier <b>64</b> for monitoring sliver breakage is arranged in the narrowing gap at the outlet between the take-off rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, that is, in the gap between the take-off rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, which narrows in cross-section in the direction towards the region in which the sliver is engaged between the rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. The barrier <b>64</b> is thus located between the nip of the rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, on the one hand, and the shared tangents of the rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> that extend perpendicular to the running direction of the sliver, on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a draw frame, for example a draw frame TD <b>03</b> made by Tr&#xfc;tzschler GmbH &#x26; Co. KG, comprises a drafting system <b>23</b> having a drafting system inlet and a drafting system outlet. The slivers <b>24</b>, coming from cans, not shown, enter a sliver guide and, drawn by take-off rollers, are transported past a measuring element. The drawing system, <b>23</b> is designed as a 4-over-3 drafting system, that is, it consists of three bottom rollers I, II, III (I being the bottom delivery roller, II being the middle bottom roller and III being the bottom feed roller) and four top rollers <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>. Drafting of the composite sliver <b>24</b> comprising a plurality of fibre slivers takes place in the drafting system <b>23</b>. The draft is made up of the preliminary draft and the main draft. The roller pairs <b>6</b>/III and <b>5</b>/II form the preliminary draft zone and the roller pairs <b>27</b>/II and <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>/I form the main draft zone. The drawn slivers (fibre web <b>29</b>) reach a web guide <b>30</b> at the drafting system outlet and are drawn by means of the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> through a sliver funnel <b>33</b>, in which they are condensed to a sliver <b>34</b>, which is subsequently laid by way of a can coiler and rotary plate <b>21</b> in sliver coils <b>35</b> in a can <b>36</b>. The reference number <b>63</b> denotes a photoelectric barrier, which is arranged at the outlet of the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> in the roller nip and serves to monitor sliver breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment in which a card drafting system <b>39</b> is arranged above the coiling plate <b>19</b> between the flat card (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the coiling plate <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The card drafting system <b>39</b> is designed as a 3-over-3 drafting system, that is, it consists of three bottom rollers I, II, III and three top rollers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>. An input-measuring funnel <b>44</b> is arranged at the entrance to the drafting system <b>39</b> and an output-measuring funnel <b>45</b> is arranged at the output of the drafting system. Downstream of the output funnel <b>45</b> are two take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, which rotate in the direction of the curved arrows and draw the stretched sliver <b>63</b> out of the output funnel <b>45</b>. A photoelectric barrier <b>48</b> is arranged between the roller nip of the take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> and the entry region <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the sliver channel <b>20</b>, and detects undesirable sliver build-up. The bottom delivery roller I, the take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> and the coiling plate <b>19</b> are driven by a main motor <b>49</b>, the bottom feed and bottom middle roller III respectively II are driven by a variable speed motor <b>50</b>. The motors <b>49</b> and <b>50</b> are connected to an electronic control and regulating device (not shown), to which all photoelectric barriers are also connected. The drafting system <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is driven in an analogous manner to the flat card drafting system <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (main and variable speed motors). A photoelectric barrier <b>61</b>, which serves to monitor the sliver <b>63</b> for breakage (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>), is arranged in the roller nip between the take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the case of a flat card (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) a photoelectric barrier <b>64</b> that serves to monitor the sliver <b>14</b> for breakage is arranged in the narrowing gap at the outlet of the take-off rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, show an arrangement suitable for use in the drafting system in a draw frame (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A photoelectric barrier <b>63</b> comprising a transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>and a receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>is arranged in the narrowing gap at the outlet of the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and serves to monitor the sliver <b>34</b> for breakage. The take-off rollers <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> rotate in the direction of the curved arrows <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>respectively. T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>denote shared tangents, which are arranged perpendicular to the running direction c of the sliver. The shared tangent T<sub>1 </sub>contacts the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> at the entrance to the narrowing gap at a point <b>31</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and the shared tangent T<sub>2 </sub>contacts the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> at the exit of the wedge-shaped area, at a point <b>31</b><i>c </i>and <b>31</b><i>c </i>respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, the transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>and the receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>are each arranged away from the end faces <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>31</b><i>e </i>and <b>32</b><i>d</i>, <b>32</b><i>e </i>respectively of the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. In this manner, it is possible to position the optical path between transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>and receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>as close as possible to the roller nip between the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. In the space (narrowing gap) between tangent T<sub>2 </sub>and the gripping point between the rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> there is only the highly focussed beam. The transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>and the receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>are also arranged away from the narrow gap owing to reasons of space. The transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>is arranged in the space between the axles <b>31</b><i>f </i>and <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the rollers <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> respectively and the receiver is arranged in the space between the axles <b>31</b><i>g </i>and <b>32</b><i>g </i>of the rollers <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> respectively. The transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>is mounted on a holding element <b>65</b><i>a </i>and the receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>is mounted on a holding element <b>65</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>shows the front view onto the roller nip at the outlet of the take-off rollers. <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> of the card drafting system <b>39</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An approximately fork-shaped holding element <b>60</b> is associated with the region at, and upstream of, the roller nip; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, this element comprises two parallel longitudinal struts <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>, forming an open, approximately U-shaped rectangle, which at one end are joined to one another by a cross strut <b>60</b><i>c</i>. Respective extensions <b>60</b><i>d </i>and <b>60</b><i>e </i>projecting at right angles are mounted at the two other ends of the longitudinal struts <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>. A photoelectric barrier <b>48</b> is arranged between the insides of the longitudinal struts <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>, such that the transmitter <b>48</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the longitudinal strut <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the receiver <b>48</b><i>b </i>is mounted on the longitudinal strut <b>60</b><i>b</i>. The optical path between transmitter <b>48</b><i>a </i>and receiver <b>48</b><i>b </i>is marked <b>48</b>&#x2032;. A photoelectric barrier <b>61</b> is arranged between the insides of the extensions <b>60</b><i>d </i>and <b>60</b><i>e</i>, such that the transmitter <b>61</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the extension <b>60</b><i>d </i>and the receiver <b>61</b><i>b </i>is mounted on the extension <b>60</b><i>e</i>. The optical path between transmitter <b>61</b><i>a </i>and receiver <b>61</b><i>b </i>is marked <b>61</b>&#x2032;. <b>62</b> denotes a shared electrical connection for the photoelectric barriers <b>48</b> and <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the holding element <b>60</b> is associated with the roller outlet of the take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> in such a way that the optical path <b>61</b>&#x2032;&#x2014;a highly focussed beam&#x2014;extends within the roller nip (wedge-shaped area) parallel to the axles of the take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>. The photoelectric barrier <b>61</b> forms a means monitoring sliver breakage. When the light beam <b>61</b>&#x2032; between transmitter <b>61</b><i>a </i>and receiver <b>61</b><i>b </i>is interrupted, a sliver <b>63</b> is present (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). When the light beam <b>61</b>&#x2032; runs from the transmitter <b>61</b><i>a </i>to the receiver <b>61</b><i>b </i>without interruption, no sliver <b>63</b> is present (fault). It is advantageous for the sliver <b>63</b> to be guided in a defined manner within the roller nip (narrowing gap) and especially in the vicinity of or even at the fibre material gripping point (nip) between the two take-off rollers <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, that is, there are no deviations, vibrations or the like-which could cause the sliver <b>63</b> to leave the optical path <b>61</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, show an arrangement suitable for use in the drafting system in a draw frame (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A photoelectric barrier <b>63</b> comprising a transmitter <b>63</b><i>a </i>and a receiver <b>63</b><i>b </i>is arranged in the narrowing gap at the outlet of the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and serves to monitor the sliver <b>34</b> for breakage. The take-off rollers <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> rotate in the direction of the curved arrows <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a</i>respectively. T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>denote shared tangents, which are arranged perpendicular to the running direction c of the sliver. The shared tangent T<sub>1 </sub>contacts the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> at the entrance to the narrowing gap at a point <b>31</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and the shared tangent T<sub>2 </sub>contacts the take-off rollers <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> at the exit of the wedge-shaped area, at a point <b>31</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
