<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to paper machine clothing, and, more particularly, to a fabric for use in a press section of a paper machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally speaking, a paper machine is made up of three sections, namely the forming section, press section and dryer section. In each section an endless engineered fabric is used to transport a continuous paper sheet through the paper machine. The structure of the fabrics for each section differs, as the functions of each section of the paper machine are different.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fiber suspension is discharged in a fine, even, cross-machine stream onto a porous wire in the forming section, typically known as a fourdrinier wire. Water drains via gravity through the wire from the fiber suspension. A press fabric for the press section must be capable of rapidly absorbing and expelling water while supporting the newly formed paper sheet. By the time the paper web enters the drying section from the press section as much as fifty percent of the water has been removed from the web. The remaining water removal is completed in the dryer section. The paper web is carried by dryer fabrics transferring the web in succession to rotating dryer cylinders arranged along the length of the dryer section and is heated by high pressure steam circulated within the dryer cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Endless woven fabrics as described above require special weaving looms, making the fabrics costly and slow to manufacture. The ends of the fabric are joined together using, e.g., thermoplastic welding; however, joining by thermoplastic welding may be unreliable, has a relatively high rate of failure, may result in a weak joint, has poor wear resistance, and has poor caliper and porosity variation. If the fabric ends are &#x201c;butted&#x201d; together, the join area is prone to gap open as the felt elongates, or stretches, on the paper machine during use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,063 (Schultz et al.) discloses a paper making felt and substrate which is bonded together with a fuse bonded joint using ultrasonic welding. Referring to FIG. 8, the ends of a substrate are clamped between stabilizing strips 64, and ultrasonic welder 75 welds the ends together. The heat generated by the ultrasonic welding renders the substrate substantially impermeable in the joint area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">PCT/GB89/00681 discloses a method for manufacturing a fabric for use in a paper making machine, wherein free ends 12, 13 of fabric <b>11</b> are folded over, butted together, and then sewn to the adjacent portion of the fabric (FIG. 2). The loops <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> at the opposite ends of the fabric created by folding ends 12, 13 are joined together by inserting a pintle wire 19 through the loops 17, 18. Pintle wire <b>19</b> of course increases the physical size of the fabric in the join area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed in the art is a method and corresponding apparatus for joining ends of a fabric together which is simple, reliable and cost effective.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a method and assembly for joining two ends of a fabric, in which the two ends are held in a join area by a pin plate and joined adhesively or mechanically to create an endless loop of fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, a method of joining two ends of a fabric for use in a paper machine, including the steps of: placing a first end of the fabric on a first portion of a pin plate, the pins in the first portion of the pin plate extending into the first end; placing a second end of the fabric on a second portion of the pin plate such that the first end and the second end are in close proximity to each other in a join area, the pins in the second portion of the pin plate extending into the second end; and joining the first end and the second end in the join area, thereby creating a join that is more homogeneous with the body of the fabric, as the pins prevent the adhesive from &#x201c;sealing&#x201d; the fabric to the joined area and with relatively uniform caliper.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention comprises, in another form thereof, a joining assembly for joining two ends of a fabric for use in a paper machine. A pin plate has a plurality of outwardly extending pins. The pin plate includes a first portion and a second portion. A first end of the fabric is placed on the first portion of the pin plate, whereby the pins in the first portion of the pin plate extend into the first end. A second end of the fabric is placed on the second portion of the pin plate such that the first end and the second end are in close proximity to each other in a join area. The pins in the second portion of the pin plate extend into the second end. A joining device joins the first end and the second end in the join area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantages of the present invention include an improved fabric join for woven and non-woven substrates having a uniform caliper, uniform density, uniform porosity, and superior strength and durability.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplification set out herein illustrates one preferred embodiment of the invention, in one form, and such exemplification is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the drawings, there is shown an embodiment of a joining assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention, used for joining a first end <b>12</b> of fabric <b>16</b> with a second end <b>14</b> of fabric <b>16</b> for use in a paper machine (not shown). Fabric <b>16</b>, shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, is in the form of a woven press fabric for use in a press section of the paper machine, but may be differently configured depending upon the application. For example, fabric <b>16</b> may be a different type of woven fabric, or may be a non-woven fabric depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Joining assembly <b>10</b> generally includes a pin plate <b>18</b> and a joining device <b>20</b> which are used for joining first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> together such that fabric <b>16</b> defines an endless loop.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fabric <b>16</b> has a machine direction (MD) <b>22</b> and a cross-machine direction (CD) <b>24</b>. Fabric <b>16</b> has a width in the cross-machine direction <b>24</b> which may vary depending upon the application. For example, fabric <b>16</b> may have a width in the cross-machine direction <b>24</b> of between approximately 1 meter in the case of a pilot paper machine to up to 10 meters in the case of a production paper machine.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Pin plate <b>18</b> has a width which is slightly wider than the corresponding width of fabric <b>16</b> in the cross-machine direction <b>24</b>. However, pin plate <b>18</b> may also have a width which is less than the width of fabric <b>16</b> in the cross-machine direction, and be used in an endwise sequential manner across the width in the cross-machine direction <b>24</b> of fabric <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Pin plate <b>18</b> includes a base <b>26</b> and a plurality of pins <b>28</b> which extend outwardly from base <b>26</b>. Base <b>26</b> may be made from any suitable material, such as metal, a suitable composite, nylon, etc. Pins <b>28</b> are preferably metal pins, but could be made from any suitable material such as plastic, etc. The exact configuration of pins <b>28</b>, as well as the attachment method between pins <b>28</b> and base <b>26</b> can vary, depending upon the application. Pin plate <b>18</b> is subdivided into a first portion <b>30</b> and a second portion <b>32</b>. First end <b>12</b> of fabric <b>16</b> is received in first portion <b>30</b>, and second end <b>14</b> of fabric <b>16</b> is received in second portion <b>32</b>. A join area <b>34</b> lying in coincidence with a sub-portion of each of first portion <b>30</b> and second portion <b>32</b> defines an area in which first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> are in close proximity to each other and permanently joined together, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Joining device <b>20</b> is schematically shown as a block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and either adhesively or mechanically bonds first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> together. When configured as an adhesive applicator, joining device <b>20</b> may apply an adhesive such as an elastomer, a thermal setting polymer or a thermal plastic to join area <b>34</b>. In one embodiment, joining device <b>20</b> is an adhesive applicator which applies an adhesive to join area <b>34</b>, and a mating cover <b>36</b> overlying pin plate <b>18</b> is used to set the correct thickness of the elastomer and cure the elastomer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the event that joining device <b>20</b> is configured to mechanically bond first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> together, then joining device <b>20</b> is preferably configured as a needle puncher for mechanically bonding first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> together. In this case, an optional scrim <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may also be used in joining first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> together. Scrim <b>38</b> is applied to join area <b>34</b> (as indicated by the dashed line) and needle punched together with first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> using joining device <b>20</b> in the form of a needle puncher.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An embodiment of the method of the present invention for joining first end <b>12</b> with second end <b>14</b> will now be described in greater detail. For the described joining method, it is assumed that fabric <b>16</b> is a woven press fabric, and joining device <b>20</b> is an adhesive applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">First end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> of fabric <b>16</b> are first fringed by removing fibers in the cross-machine direction <b>24</b> using a suitable fringing technique. First end <b>12</b> is placed on first portion <b>30</b> of pin plate <b>18</b> such that pins <b>28</b> extend into and through first end <b>12</b>. Similarly, second end <b>14</b> is placed on second portion <b>32</b> of pin plate <b>18</b> such that pins <b>28</b> extend into and through second end <b>14</b>. The fringed ends of first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> (i.e., the fibers of first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> extending in machine direction <b>22</b>) are positioned to overlap with each other in join area <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between approximately 1 mm to 12 mm, preferably approximately 3 mm (also corresponding to the width of join area <b>34</b>). Adhesive applicator <b>20</b> then applies an elastomer adhesive over joined area <b>34</b>. Cover <b>36</b> is placed over pin plate <b>18</b> and is positioned relative to pin plate <b>18</b> to provide a desired thickness of the elastomer. Cover <b>36</b> is held in place while the elastomer cures, and may also optionally be heated to assist in the curing process. Cover <b>36</b> and pin plate <b>18</b> are then removed from fabric <b>16</b>, which is then ready for use in the press section of a paper machine. After being joined, join area <b>34</b> has a maximum thickness of not more than 2.5 times the thickness of fabric <b>16</b> (outside join area <b>34</b>), and a minimum thickness of not less than the thickness of fabric <b>16</b> (outside join area <b>34</b>). Join area <b>34</b> is permeable to air and water.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment of the joining method described above, first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> are fringed prior to joining using joining assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention. However, it will be appreciate that first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> need not be fringed, depending upon the application. Further, in the embodiment of the joining method described above, pin plate <b>18</b> extends along cross-machine direction <b>24</b> of fabric <b>16</b>. It will also be appreciated that joining assembly <b>10</b> may be used for joining a fabric <b>16</b> along machine direction <b>22</b>, or may also be used at an angled bias to cross-machine direction <b>24</b> (such as if first end <b>12</b> and second end <b>14</b> are formed with a tail).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.</p>
