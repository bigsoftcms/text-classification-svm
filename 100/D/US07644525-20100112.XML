<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to irons comprising a soleplate surmounted by a heating unit equipped with a steam chamber and more particularly relates to an iron in which the steam chamber communicates with a reservoir by means of a supply circuit comprising a control valve whose opening is controlled by a thermally deformable element in thermal communication with the heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are steam irons known from the patents FR 2,358,498 and EP 1,000,192 comprising a water reservoir communicating with a steam chamber by means of a control valve whose opening is controlled by a bimetallic strip. Such irons offer the advantage of freeing the user from having to adjust the flow of steam, which is done automatically as a function of the temperature of the soleplate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, irons of this type have the disadvantage of having an automatic steam flow control device that is very sensitive to the relative positioning of the bimetallic strip with respect to the control valve, so that the adjustment of the steam obtained for a given temperature varies from one iron to another and depends, among other things, on the manufacturing tolerances and the assembly of the parts. In particular, the deformation range of a bimetallic strip for the operating temperatures of an iron is limited to approximately 3 mm, so the adjustment of the flow of steam is very sensitive to a deviation in the positioning of the bimetallic strip. Such irons therefore do not make it possible to obtain an optimized adjustment of the flow of steam for a given temperature of the soleplate, to the detriment of the ironing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the object of the present invention is to eliminate these drawbacks by proposing an iron comprising an automatic steam flow control device that is less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances and to the assembly of the parts so as to ensure, from one iron to another, a more constant adjustment of the flow of steam for a given temperature of the soleplate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another object of the present invention is to propose an iron comprising an automatic steam flow control device having very good reactivity at low temperatures in order to prevent the water from being admitted into the steam chamber when the latter is too cold to evaporate the water, which runs the risk of dripping out through the steam outlet holes in the soleplate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the invention is achieved by a steam iron comprising a soleplate in thermal communication with a heating unit equipped with a steam chamber, the steam chamber communicating with a reservoir by means of a supply circuit comprising a flow control valve whose degree of opening is controlled by a thermally deformable element in thermal communication with the heating unit, characterized in that the opening of the control valve is braked, beginning at an intermediate temperature, by a stabilizing element exerting a force that opposes the force generated by the thermally deformable element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a feature offers the advantage of making it possible to establish a plateau in the opening curve of the control valve as a function of the temperature. The degree of opening of the valve is thus stabilized, in a temperature range of several degrees beginning at the intermediate temperature, at a value that allows the flow of steam to be adapted to the intermediate temperature of the soleplate. Moreover, the fact that the stabilizing element does not affect the opening of the valve below the intermediate temperature makes it possible to retain high reactivity at the low operating temperatures of the iron, thus making it possible to ensure an efficient anti-drip function.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another feature of the invention, the intermediate temperature at which the thermally deformable element begins to be braked by the stabilizing element is between 130&#xb0; C. and 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another feature of the invention, the stabilizing element is constituted by a spring rod.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another feature of the invention, the force produced by the stabilizing element is exerted directly on a component of the control valve.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another feature of the invention, the force produced by the stabilizing element is exerted directly on the thermally deformable element.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to yet another feature of the invention, the stabilizing element and the control valve are borne by the same support piece.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another feature of the invention, the support piece is a thermal shield disposed on top of the heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another feature of the invention, the thermally deformable element is a bimetallic strip.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to yet another feature of the invention, the supply circuit also comprises a plug valve disposed in series with the control valve, which plug valve can occupy a closed position for dry ironing and at least one open position calibrated to allow the passage of a flow of water corresponding to the maximum steam rate that the steam chamber can provide.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another feature of the invention, the plug valve can occupy an additional position that allows a larger quantity of water to pass through abruptly in order to perform a self-cleaning operation.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the soleplate <b>1</b> is surmounted by a heating unit <b>5</b>, advantageously made of aluminum, conventionally comprising a heating element <b>51</b> bent into a horseshoe shape and a boss <b>52</b> provided for receiving a temperature control thermostat, not shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The heating unit <b>5</b> comprises, in its upper part, a steam chamber <b>53</b> of large dimensions, shown in dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, closed by a closing plate <b>54</b> having an opening <b>54</b>A near the front end of the steam chamber <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A thermal shield <b>6</b> is interposed between the top face of the heating unit <b>5</b> and the housing <b>2</b>, this thermal shield <b>6</b> incorporating a lateral skirt <b>61</b> having a lower edge that conforms to the external shape of the soleplate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing <b>2</b> encloses a water reservoir <b>7</b> whose bottom part is defined by the thermal shield <b>6</b>, the latter comprising an annular channel <b>62</b> that receives, with an interposed sealing strip, the walls of the housing <b>2</b> defining the top part of the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref>, the iron comprises a supply circuit that provides a passage for the water from the reservoir <b>7</b> to the steam chamber <b>53</b> and comprises a plug valve <b>8</b> that extends into the opening <b>54</b>A of the plate <b>54</b>, the plug valve <b>8</b> comprising a nozzle gasket <b>9</b> that rests on the closing plate <b>54</b> and a stem <b>80</b> whose axial movement is controlled by the control button <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By means of the control button <b>4</b>, the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve can be brought into three distinct positions, respectively for dry-ironing, for steam-ironing and for a self-cleaning operation for de-scaling the iron.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To this end, the stem <b>80</b> comprises a solid part that closes the opening of the nozzle gasket <b>9</b> when the stem <b>80</b> is moved into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The stem <b>80</b> also comprises a first notch <b>80</b>A having a flow cross-section that limits the maximum flow of water sent to the steam chamber <b>53</b> when the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve is moved into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> by rotating the control button <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Lastly, the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve comprises a second notch <b>80</b>B that provides a larger flow cross-section and allows the iron to be cleaned by the abrupt delivery of a large quantity of water into the superheated steam chamber <b>53</b> when the stem <b>80</b> is moved into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by rotating the control button <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The supply circuit comprises, upstream from the plug valve <b>8</b>, a control valve <b>10</b> and an intermediate chamber <b>15</b> disposed between the control valve <b>10</b> and the plug valve <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control valve <b>10</b> comprises a shaft <b>11</b> equipped with a conical part <b>11</b>B that extends through an opening <b>13</b> that opens into the bottom of the reservoir <b>7</b> so that the flow cross-section of the water from the reservoir to the intermediate chamber varies when the shaft <b>11</b> is moved axially through the opening <b>13</b>. The top part of the shaft <b>11</b> supports a closing element <b>12</b> constituted by a rubber bell that surrounds the shaft <b>11</b>, the periphery of the cap <b>12</b> coming into watertight contact with the perimeter of the opening <b>13</b> when the shaft <b>11</b> is moved axially downward, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The top end of the shaft <b>11</b> is connected to the end of a lever <b>14</b> pivot-mounted on a wall <b>63</b> borne by the thermal shield <b>6</b>, the other end of the lever <b>14</b> having an opening through which the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve passes, the latter comprising a pin <b>81</b> that comes to rest on the end of the lever <b>14</b> when the control button <b>4</b> is moved into the self-cleaning position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bottom part of the shaft <b>11</b> passes through a sealing diaphragm <b>90</b> and has a rounded end forming a tip <b>11</b>A that is aligned with the free end of an elongated bimetallic strip <b>16</b> borne by the heating unit <b>5</b>, the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> being attached to a boss <b>55</b> of the heating unit <b>5</b> by means of a screw <b>17</b>. Advantageously, the sealing diaphragm <b>90</b> is borne by the rubber piece attached to the thermal shield <b>6</b> that also defines the nozzle gasket <b>9</b>, this rubber piece delimiting the bottom part of the intermediate chamber <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More particularly according to the invention, the control valve <b>10</b> comprises a stabilizing element constituted by a spring rod <b>18</b> borne by the thermal shield <b>6</b>. This spring rod <b>18</b> is advantageously attached at one of its ends to the bottom face of the thermal shield <b>6</b> by means of a screw <b>19</b>, the other end of the spring rod <b>18</b> extending freely over the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> and coming to abut the tip <b>11</b>A of the control valve, as is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For example, the spring rod <b>18</b> will be made of stainless steel wire with a diameter on the order of 0.8 to 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The operation of the control device will now be described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents a sectional view of the supply circuit of the steam chamber <b>53</b> in which dot-and-dash lines represent the position of the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> for a cold soleplate and solid lines represent the position of the bimetallic strip for a soleplate temperature on the order of 120&#xb0; C. In this figure, the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve <b>8</b> is shown, by way of example, in the closed position for dry ironing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to this figure, when the temperature of the soleplate is lower than 120&#xb0; C., the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> is curved downward and is not in contact with the tip <b>11</b>A on the end of the stem of the control valve <b>10</b>, the weight of the shaft <b>11</b> and the elasticity of the diaphragm <b>90</b> ensuring the closing of the closing element <b>12</b>. Under these conditions, the water from the reservoir <b>7</b> cannot flow into the intermediate chamber <b>15</b>, so the steam chamber <b>53</b> does not receive any water, even if the plug valve <b>8</b> is in the open position, as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for steam ironing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bimetallic strip <b>16</b> thus provides an anti-drip function by preventing water from being sent into the steam chamber <b>53</b> when the temperature of the latter is not high enough to ensure its evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the temperature of the soleplate <b>1</b> reaches a temperature on the order of 120&#xb0; C., the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> again comes into contact with the tip <b>11</b>A on the end of the shaft of the control valve <b>10</b>, then acts on the latter with a vertical pressure that tends to lift the shaft <b>11</b> and the closing element <b>12</b> associated with it. Above that temperature, the pressure exerted on the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> lifts the closing element <b>12</b> and the water from the reservoir <b>7</b> can flow at a low rate through the opening <b>13</b> into the intermediate chamber <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the temperature of the soleplate reaches an intermediate temperature, around 140&#xb0; C., the bimetallic strip comes into contact with the spring rod <b>18</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which represents an enlarged view of the supply circuit. The bimetallic strip <b>16</b> is thus stabilized in a predefined position by the spring rod <b>18</b>, this stabilized position of the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> corresponding to an opening of the valve <b>10</b> adapted for supplying a low flow of steam, for example on the order of 10 g/min, the shaft <b>11</b> then being lifted by approximately 0.5 mm relative to its initial resting position corresponding to the closure of the closing element <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Beginning at this intermediate temperature, the deformation of the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> is braked by the forces generated by the spring rod <b>18</b> so that an additional lifting of the shaft <b>11</b> only occurs if the force generated by the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> is greater than the force generated by the spring rod <b>18</b>. This additional lifting advantageously occurs beginning at 160&#xb0; C. and the movement of the shaft <b>11</b> of the control valve <b>10</b>, braked by the spring rod <b>18</b>, is then substantially linear with the increase in the temperature until the maximum opening of the valve <b>10</b> is reached, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which corresponds to a temperature of the soleplate on the order of 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, between the temperature on the order of 160&#xb0; C. at which the force generated by the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> is greater than the force generated by the spring rod <b>18</b> and the maximum ironing temperature of the soleplate, a controlled movement of the shaft <b>11</b> of the control valve <b>10</b> is obtained, resulting in a progressive increase in the flow of water running into the steam chamber <b>53</b>, which is defined by the flow cross-section at the level of the conical part <b>11</b>B of the shaft passing through the opening <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Advantageously, the flow of water that can be sent into the steam chamber <b>53</b> is limited to a maximum value defined by the flow cross-section of the first notch <b>80</b>A of the stem of the plug valve, this first notch <b>80</b>A being dimensioned to correspond to the maximum flow of steam that can be produced by the steam chamber <b>53</b>, given the power of the heating element <b>51</b>. For example, the first groove <b>80</b>A will be dimensioned so as to allow a maximum flow of water corresponding to a steam production on the order of 35 g/min.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the supply circuit of the steam chamber <b>53</b> when the control button <b>4</b> is turned to the self-cleaning position. In this position of the button <b>4</b>, the stem <b>80</b> of the plug valve is moved downward and the second notch <b>80</b>B, of larger cross-section, is aligned with the nozzle gasket <b>9</b>, thus allowing the abrupt delivery of a large quantity of water into the steam chamber <b>53</b>. This self-cleaning operation, which is intrinsically known, takes place with the temperature thermostat of the soleplate <b>1</b> set to the maximum temperature. According to this figure, the downward movement of the stem <b>80</b> is accompanied by a push from the pin <b>81</b> on the end of the lever <b>14</b>, which causes the latter to pivot, the opposite end of the lever maintaining the shaft <b>11</b> of the control valve <b>10</b> in a raised position corresponding to the maximum degree of opening of the valve <b>10</b>. Such a feature makes it possible to maintain a large flow of water from the reservoir <b>7</b> to the steam chamber <b>53</b> when the temperature of the soleplate drops during the self-cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 15</figref> illustrate a variant of embodiment of the supply circuit of the steam chamber wherein the control valve and the stabilizing element constituted by the spring rod have been modified, the other elements of the iron remaining being similar to those described above for the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to these figures, the supply circuit comprises a control valve <b>110</b> comprising a substantially cylindrical shaft <b>111</b> extending through the opening <b>13</b> in the bottom of the reservoir, this shaft <b>111</b> supporting a closing element <b>112</b> constituted by a rubber bell capable of sealing the opening <b>13</b> when the shaft <b>111</b> is moved downward.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">More particularly according to the invention, the control valve <b>110</b> comprises a stabilizing element constituted by a spring rod <b>118</b> borne by the thermal shield <b>6</b>. This spring rod <b>118</b> has one of its ends attached to the top face of the thermal shield <b>6</b> by means of a screw <b>119</b>, the other end of the spring rod <b>118</b> having a bent portion that extends over the closing element <b>112</b> and exerts a downward pressure on the latter in order to close the closing element <b>112</b> and prevent the flow of water from the reservoir <b>7</b> to the opening <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a way that is similar to the first embodiment, the top end of the shaft <b>111</b> is connected to the lever <b>14</b> pivot-mounted to the wall <b>63</b> and the bottom end of the shaft <b>111</b> has a rounded end forming a tip <b>111</b>A that passes through the sealing diaphragm <b>90</b> and aligns with the free end of the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> borne by the heating unit <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More particularly according to this variant of embodiment, the shaft <b>111</b> of the valve <b>110</b> has four vanes <b>113</b> extending 90&#xb0; from one another between the closing element <b>112</b> and the diaphragm <b>90</b>, these vanes forming spacers which participate, in particular, in the immobilization of the diaphragm <b>90</b> on the shaft <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As may be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the closing element <b>112</b> has a center bore <b>112</b>A comprising in its bottom part a reduced diameter forming a lip <b>112</b>B that fits into a groove <b>111</b>B of the shaft <b>111</b> disposed just above the vanes <b>113</b>. The diameters of the center bore <b>112</b>A and the lip <b>112</b>B are larger than the external diameters of the parts of the shaft <b>111</b> that align with them, resulting in a radial space between the shaft <b>111</b> and the closing element <b>112</b>, advantageously on the order of several tens of millimeters, which allows the water to pass through.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The height of the groove <b>111</b>B is greater than the height of the lip <b>112</b>B so that the shaft <b>111</b> can move axially by several millimeters through the closing element <b>112</b> between a closed position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>, in which the lip <b>112</b>B rests against the top edge of the groove <b>111</b>B, and an open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>, in which the lip <b>112</b>B rests against the bottom edge of the groove <b>111</b>B. In the closed position, the water from the reservoir <b>7</b> cannot flow to the intermediate chamber <b>15</b> because of the watertight seal established between the top edge of the lip <b>112</b>B and the top edge of the groove <b>111</b>B. Conversely, in the open position, the water from the reservoir can pass into the radial space running between the shaft <b>111</b> and the lip <b>112</b>B and flow through a calibrated notch <b>111</b>C formed in the bottom edge of the groove <b>111</b>B, between two vanes <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operation of the control device according to the second embodiment will now be described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the supply circuit of the steam chamber <b>53</b> when the temperature of the soleplate <b>1</b> is cold, the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> being curved downward and the closing element <b>112</b> of the control valve <b>110</b> being returned by the spring rod <b>118</b> in contact with the wall of the thermal shield <b>6</b> defining the bottom of the reservoir. In this position, the closing element <b>112</b> forms a watertight seal around the opening <b>13</b> and the shaft <b>111</b> of the control valve is moved, by its weight and by the elastic return of the sealing diaphragm <b>90</b>, into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>in which the top edge of the lip <b>112</b>B of the closing element is in watertight contact with the top edge of the groove <b>111</b>B so that the water cannot flow into the steam chamber <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As the temperature of the soleplate <b>1</b> increases, the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> enters into contact with the tip <b>11</b>A of the shaft of the control valve and lifts the latter slightly so as to bring the bottom edge of the groove <b>111</b>B into contact with the bottom edge of the lip <b>112</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>b </i>and <b>14</b>, when the temperature of the soleplate reaches an intermediate temperature, advantageously on the order of 140&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, this lifting of the shaft <b>111</b> of the control valve first takes place without lifting the closing element <b>112</b>, which remains pressed against the bottom of the reservoir <b>7</b>, thus ensuring the seal around the opening <b>13</b>. In fact, preferably, the force generated by the spring rod <b>118</b> on the closing element <b>112</b> is greater than the force generated by the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> on the shaft <b>111</b> when the temperature of the soleplate <b>1</b> remains below a temperature threshold, advantageously on the order of 160&#xb0; C. In this position of the control valve <b>110</b>, the water can pass into the space running between the center bore <b>112</b>A, the lip <b>112</b>B of the closing element and the shaft <b>111</b> of the valve, then escape in the direction of the intermediate chamber <b>15</b> through the notch <b>111</b>C provided on the perimeter of the bottom edge of the groove <b>111</b>B prior to flowing through the plug valve <b>8</b> into the steam chamber <b>53</b>. Thus, for a temperature of the soleplate between 140&#xb0; C. and 160&#xb0; C., a substantially constant flow of water is obtained which is defined by the flow cross-section of the notch <b>111</b>C, the latter being adapted for producing a flow of steam on the order of 10 g/min.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the temperature of the soleplate reaches the temperature thresholds on the order of 160&#xb0; C., the force exerted by the bimetallic strip <b>16</b> on the tip <b>111</b>A of the shaft is greater than the force exerted by the spring rod <b>118</b> on the closing element <b>112</b> so that the closing element <b>112</b> is lifted off the bottom of the reservoir <b>7</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In this position, the control valve <b>110</b> allows a large quantity of water to pass under the closing element <b>112</b>, then through the opening <b>13</b> to the intermediate chamber <b>15</b>, the flow of water sent to the steam chamber <b>53</b> being limited by the flow cross-section of the first notch <b>80</b>A of the stem of the plug valve, which is dimensioned to allow the passage of a maximum flow of water corresponding to a steam production of 35 g/min.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This results in a steam iron equipped with a device for automatically controlling the steam as a function of the temperature of the soleplate wherein the opening of the valve for controlling the flow of water sent to the steam chamber at around an intermediate temperature, is stabilized at a predetermined value by the spring rod so that the opening of the valve is substantially constant in a temperature range of about ten degrees above that intermediate temperature. Such a control device thus makes it possible to considerably reduce the impact of the tolerances for the assembly of the thermal shield to the heating unit on the adjustment of the control device. Moreover, the fact that the spring rod is directly attached to the thermal shield makes it possible to reduce any imprecision due to variances in assembly, given that the control valve and the spring rod are borne by the same part.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Conversely, the free deformation of the bimetallic strip relative to the temperature below the reference temperature makes it possible to maintain a system that is highly reactive at low temperatures so that the system efficiently ensures the anti-drip function by ensuring the rapid blockage of the flow of water to the steam chamber when the latter is not at a high enough temperature to ensure the evaporation of the drops of water.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is understood that the invention is in no way limited to the embodiment described and illustrated, which is given only as an example. Certain modifications are possible, particularly from the standpoint of the arrangement of the various elements or the substitution of technical equivalents, without going beyond the scope of protection of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, in a variant of embodiment not represented, the bimetallic strip can, for example, take the form of a disk or a thermostatic spring.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, in another variant of embodiment not represented, the control valve can be a rotary valve.</p>
