<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to vapor-phase and hydraulic-phase digesters used to process cellulosic fibers into pulp. In particular, the invention relates to top separators for such digesters.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Digesters are pressure cooking vessels used to process cellulosic fibrous material, such as wood chips. The digester applies pressure and cooking liquor to process the chips into cellulose pulp from which paper products may be made. A digester vessel is generally a vertical column often having a height greater than 100 feet (about 30 meters). There are essentially two types of continuous digesters: a hydraulic digester and an dual-phase or vapor-phase digester (hereinafter referred to as a vapor-phase digester). A hydraulic digester is a pressure-resistant vessel which is filled with comminuted cellulosic fibrous material and liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vapor-phase digester includes a pressure vessel that is partially filled with a slurry of the cellulosic fiber and cooking liquor and has a super-atmospheric steam zone (also referred to as the gas zone) above the slurry. The gas in the vapor zone is compressible The pressure within a vapor-phase digester is typically determined by the pressure of the gas at the top of the digester.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, wood chips are introduced into hydraulic and vapor phase digesters via mechanical top separators. However, the top separator for a hydraulic digester have typically been different than top separators for vapor-phase digesters. The top separators for both types of digesters have an input port coupled to a feed system. Wood chips, or other comminuted cellulosic fibrous material, are typically fed to continuous digester via the feed system and top separator. The feed system typically includes equipment for de-aerating, heating, pressurizing, and introducing cooking liquor to the chips before transferring a slurry of chips and liquor to the digester. Top separators have conventionally served to introduce chips into a digester and to extract cooking liquor from the input chip slurry. Top separators are used in hydraulic and vapor phase digesters.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a hydraulic digester, the input slurry of chips and liquor is introduced to a top separator having a downward-directed screw-type conveyor. In the vapor-phase digester, the slurry of chips and liquor is transferred to a screw-type conveyor which moves the slurry upwards so that the chips and liquor overflow the top of the conveyor and fall freely in the steam-filled atmosphere of the digester. This upward flow and overflow of chips and liquid is suited to the vapor-phase digester because it prevents the escape of gas as the slurry is introduced to the digester while providing a weir-type reservoir for removing excess liquid. The top separator for a vapor-phase digester is known in the art as an &#x201c;inverted top separator&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a vapor-phase digester, the wood chips are typically heated by exposure to steam as the chips are introduced to the steam-filled zone at the top of the digester. A vapor-phase digester directly exposes chips to steam for heating by having a chip level that is above the level of the liquid in the digester. The chips are exposed to steam as they are distributed in the vessel by a top separator device and as they rest on the top of the chip pile.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a vapor phase digester, the chips are &#x201c;cooked&#x201d; as they move from the top of the chip pile and progress down into the slurry through the digester vessel. The inverted top separator is mounted in the top section of the digester. The top section of the vessel contains a vapor portion, and the portion of the vessel below the vapor is filled with a liquid-chip slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Top separators for hydraulic and vapor phase digesters remove excess liquid from the slurry. The removed liquid. e.g., liquor, is returned to the feed system (e.g. conventional high pressure feeder) as a source of slurrying liquid. The functions of the top separators for hydraulic and vapor phase digester are similar, but they have distinct applications to their respective type of digester.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The top separator is one of the few major components of a digester vessel that has conventionally had a substantially different construction depending on whether the separator is for a hydraulic or vapor phase digester. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,332,954 and 6,325,889. In a hydraulic digester, the top separator has an upper inlet for the chip slurry, a downwardly turning screw conveyor, a bottom chip discharge and the entire separator sits on top of a cone. The cone and the bottom of the separator form a top to the liquid and chip filled portion of the hydraulic digester vessel. In a vapor phase digester, the top separator is mounted directly in the gas filled portion of the vessel (without an underlying cone), has a bottom chip slurry inlet, an upwardly turning screw conveyor, and an annular chip discharge chute at the top of the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other than the top separator, the major components of the digester, e.g., vessel wall, screens, outlets and liquor piping, are generally common to both types of digesters. There are other differences between the structure of a vapor phase and hydraulic digesters, as is discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,174,411 and 5,882,477. In view of the differences between the top separators and other differences, vapor phase digesters have in the past not been interchangeable with or convertible to hydraulic digesters, and vice versa. However, there is a long felt need for commonality of components between the digester types and for an ability to convert one type of digester to another.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the top section of a continuous digester <b>10</b>. The digester may be the only digesting vessel in a pulping system, or may be one of two or more vessels, where another vessel may be an impregnation vessel. The digester <b>10</b> receives a slurry of comminuted cellulosic fibrous material, typically wood chips, mixed in with cooking liquor, such as kraft white liquor. The slurry is typically first treated in a chip feed system, for example, a Lo-Level&#x2122; feed system as sold by Andritz Inc. of Glens Falls, N.Y.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The digester includes a top separator <b>12</b> mounted in the top of the digester vessel <b>14</b>. The separator is within the vessel. Chips flow in a slurry with liquor into the digester through one or more inlet pipes <b>16</b>. Liquor extracted by the top separator flows out of the digester through one or more liquor outlet pipes <b>17</b>. The screw conveyor in the digester is turned by a transmission and motor that are coupled to the vertical shaft of the conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The digester <b>10</b> may be a vapor-phase digester or a hydraulic digester. In hydraulic mode, the digester is substantially filled with cooking liquor and chips up to the top of the vessel <b>14</b>. Vapor, such as steam or inert gas, may be injected at the top of the vapor-phase digester to provide pressure control, heat or other desired functions. When the separator <b>12</b> is in a hydraulic digester, the separator is substantially immersed in cooking liquor. The immersion is in contrast to earlier hydraulic digesters in which the separator was arranged on an internal cone in the vessel. Without a cone and when in hydraulic mode, the top separator allows cooking liquor and chips to flow around the outside of the separator, flow into the separator through an upper chip discharge chute and any opening in the bottom of the separator, and fill the interior of the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the digester is configured as a vapor-phase digester, there is a gas phase <b>18</b> above a liquid phase <b>20</b> in the vessel <b>14</b>. The separator <b>12</b> is generally entirely in the gas phase <b>18</b>. The separator is supported in the vessel by support beams (not shown) in both the hydraulic and vapor phase digesters. As chips leave the separator, the chips fall to the top of the chip pile <b>21</b>, the top of which may protrude into the gas phase <b>18</b>. The majority of the chip pile is immersed in the liquid phase <b>20</b> of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The chips and liquor discharged from separator <b>12</b> fall through a gas-filled zone <b>18</b> onto a chip pile <b>21</b>. Typically, steam is supplied to the gas zone <b>18</b> via a steam conduit <b>22</b>. Other gases may be combined with steam or used in substitution for steam. To continue the steam heating of the chips, the level of the chip pile <b>21</b> is maintained above the level of the cooking liquor <b>20</b>. After steam heating and as the chips sink down into the vessel, the chips are immersed in cooking liquor as they pass below the liquid level, where the cooking process continues. Screens <b>23</b> (at various levels in the liquid portion of the digester) may be used in a conventional manner to remove some black cooking liquor from the chips flowing downward through the vessel <b>14</b> of the digester <b>10</b>. Additional cooking liquor may be injected into the digester, usually at various screen levels. The chips may also be submerged in the liquor as is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,882,477; 6,024,837 and 6,174,411.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a close-up view of a first embodiment of an inverted the top separator <b>24</b>, shown in a cut-away view. The separator is attached to the top of the digester vessel and the separator shaft <b>25</b> is coaxial with the vessel. The shaft extends upward through the top of the vessel and into a drive mechanism <b>26</b> with a motor and transmission. The screw conveyor <b>28</b> normally rotates in a single rotational direction. However, the drive mechanism <b>26</b> may be configured to allow the rotational direction of the conveyor to be reversed, especially when the digester is converted from hydraulic phase to vapor phase or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The screw conveyor <b>28</b> is attached to the vertical shaft <b>25</b>. The conveyor <b>28</b> may be formed of a helical sheet of metal that is welded to the shaft. The helical sheet of the conveyor may have pumping holes <b>29</b>. These holes have, in the past, allowed liquor to flow upstream through the conveyor in a direction opposite to the turn of the screw. Cooking liquor can flow easily through the pumping holes <b>29</b> to distribute liquor throughout the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The top separator <b>24</b> includes a substantially cylindrical side screen <b>30</b> and a bottom screen <b>31</b>, that together form a screen drum. The drum blocks the passage of chips and fibers while allowing the passage of liquid from the chip slurry. Liquid passing through the screen drum is extracted through the outlet pipe <b>17</b>. The chips and remainder of the liquid flow are moved upward by the screw conveyor <b>28</b> to the chip outlet chute <b>34</b>. The screw conveyor rotates in the screen drum so as to move the chips upward as they are received through the bottom chip inlet <b>32</b>. Chips are discharged from the top of the top separator, as indicated by arrow <b>35</b>. As they are discharged, the chips are exposed to steam and fall onto the underlying chip pile <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The screen drum allows liquor to pass and prevents the passage of chips and wood fibers. As liquor passes through the screens <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, it flows into an annular volume <b>37</b> between the screens and a cylindrical container <b>33</b> that forms the outer housing of the separator. The container is connected to one or more outlet pipes <b>17</b> that feed extracted liquor to an outlet port on the exterior of the vessel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An annular discharge chute <b>34</b> forms an upper region of the container <b>33</b> and is above the screw conveyor <b>28</b>. A ring of paddles <b>36</b> on a disk rotate above the conveyor and move the chips flowing from the conveyor towards the discharge chute. Arrow <b>35</b> indicates the flow path of the chips being discharged from the separator. From the discharge chute, the chips flow into the open volume of the digester vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A chip inlet pipe <b>32</b> extends to the bottom of the separator, as is conventional with an inverted top separator. The inlet pipe includes a flange or other connection <b>40</b> between a straight portion <b>42</b> of the pipe and an elbow portion <b>44</b> that is adapted to connect to the bottom inlet <b>32</b> of the separator. The flange <b>40</b> allows the elbow <b>44</b> to be removed or inverted. The elbow may be removed or inverted in connection with converting the digester from a vapor phase to a hydraulic digester. With the elbow removed or inverted, the chip slurry discharges directly to the vessel interior. The chip slurry flows directly into the liquid that fills the hydraulic digester.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With the elbow <b>44</b> removed or inverted, the top separator <b>24</b> does not introduce chips into the digester. The bottom of the separator will have an aperture at the inlet <b>32</b> where the elbow <b>44</b> was previously connected. Cooking liquor and some chips may flow into the aperture of the inlet <b>32</b> and enter the separator. As the screw conveyor <b>28</b> turns, cooking liquid is driven through the screen and is extracted through the liquor outlet pipe <b>17</b>. Liquor <b>30</b> may also flow into the separator through the annular chip discharge chute <b>34</b> at the top of the separator. Liquor flows throughout the separator as the screw rotates and by flowing through the pumping holes in the screw. If chips enter the separator through the bottom inlet <b>32</b>, the rotation of the screw carries the chips up to the top of the separator where the rotating paddles <b>36</b> push the chips out the discharge chute <b>34</b>. The screw conveyor also scrapes and cleans the inside surface of the screen cylinder <b>30</b> as the conveyor rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The liquid level in a hydraulic digester is at the top of the digester. In an essentially hydraulic digester (such as a digester that can have a vapor space above the liquid level where the control scheme is one of a vapor digester but the pulp produced has the qualities of a hydraulic digester) the liquid level is at or above the chip discharge chute <b>34</b> of the separator. Accordingly, liquor also flows into the separator via the chip discharge chute. The pumping holes <b>29</b> allow the liquor entering the top of the separate to flow downward to the bottom of the separator. The screw conveyor is rotating to move liquor and chips upward. Because the pumping holes allow downward flow in the separator, the inlet <b>32</b> to the separator may be left open or closed. Alternatively, the entire bottom floor and bottom screen <b>31</b> of the separator may be removed so that liquor and chips may be pulled by the rotating conveyor <b>28</b> up into the separator. The liquor and chips are discharged <b>35</b> from the top of the separator, but a portion of the liquor is extracted through the cylindrical screen <b>33</b>. With the entire bottom floor removed, the screw conveyor can rotate so as to transport material either upward or downward.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The volume of liquor extracted by the separator should be sufficient for digester operation, even when the interior chip inlet pipe <b>38</b> discharges separately from the separator. Because the separator is immersed in the cooking liquor in the hydraulic phase digester, the separator will be filled with cooking liquor which can be screened. The amount of liquor removed from the immersed separator is believed to be comparable to the amount of liquor extracted with conventional top separators in hydraulic digesters with a chip inlet coupled to the separator. Accordingly, the separator can perform its function of removing excess liquor in a hydraulic digester even though relatively few chips move through the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a second embodiment of top separator <b>50</b> that may be converted for operation in a hydraulic or vapor-phase digester. The second top separator <b>50</b> is similar in construction as the first top separator <b>24</b>. The digester has a first chip inlet pipe <b>52</b> for vapor phase operation and a second inlet pipe <b>54</b> for hydraulic digester operation. The chip inlet for vapor phase operation is connected to a bottom inlet <b>32</b> of the separator. The vapor phase chip inlet pipe <b>52</b> is coupled to the separator so that all chips flow upward through the separator. Chips are moved through the separator to the upper discharge chute <b>34</b> so that the chips may be evenly and annularly distributed from high in the vapor portion of the vessel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The chip inlet pipe <b>54</b> for hydraulic phase operation extends to the center axis of the vessel <b>14</b> and projects the chip slurry downward into the vessel. The hydraulic inlet pipe <b>54</b> does not introduce chips into the separator <b>50</b>. When in hydraulic operation, the first chip inlet pipe <b>52</b> is turned off by a valve and does not introduce chips or liquor into the separator. The bottom inlet <b>32</b> to the separator is closed by a valve during hydraulic operation. Liquor flows into the separator through the top chip discharge chute <b>34</b>, in the manner described above in connection with the first separator embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a third embodiment of top separator <b>60</b> that may be converted for operation in a hydraulic or vapor-phase digester. The third top separator may be operated as an inverted top separator with a bottom chip slurry inlet <b>62</b> while the vessel <b>14</b> is in a vapor phase digester mode. In this vapor phase mode, the chip slurry enters the bottom inlet <b>32</b> of the separator and is moved upwards by the screw conveyor <b>28</b> through the screen drum <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> housed in the container <b>33</b>. The paddles <b>36</b> discharge the chips and liquor out through the annular chip discharge ring <b>34</b> in the direction of arrow <b>35</b>. A portion of the liquor in the slurry moving upwards through the screw is extracted through the screen drum and outputted through the liquor outlet <b>17</b>. This vapor phase operation of the top separator is common to the first, second and third embodiments of the top separator <b>24</b> and <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To convert to hydraulic phase operation, the inside of the vessel portion <b>64</b> of the bottom chip inlet pipe is removed. Similarly, the bottom floor <b>66</b> of the screen container <b>33</b> is removed, along with any bottom screen <b>31</b>. The removal of the inlet pipe <b>62</b> and bottom <b>66</b> leaves the bottom of the separator open to the flow chips and liquor. In addition, the rotational direction of the screw conveyor <b>28</b> is reversed so that the chip slurry is moved through the separator from top to bottom. In addition, a top chip slurry inlet pipe <b>68</b> is added to feed the slurry into the top <b>70</b> of the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Modifications may be needed to the upper portion of the digester and top separator to provide a flow passage for the chip slurry. However, top inlets for separators are well known and typically provide a chip flow passage to the center vertical axis of the separator. The inlet flow passage <b>68</b> is arranged to prevent the chip slurry from being discharged out the upper discharge chute <b>34</b>. However, it is not critical to disable the upper discharge chute <b>34</b> because chips discharged from the upper chute will directly enter the liquid filled portion of the hydraulic digester in a similar manner as the chips flowing out the bottom of the separator. Moreover, liquor will fill the interior of the separator regardless of whether some chips flow out the upper discharge chute <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During hydraulic phase operation, the chip slurry flows through the inlet pipe <b>68</b> into the top inlet <b>70</b> of the separator. A portion of the chips may or may not flow out the upper discharge chute <b>34</b>. If the upper discharge chute <b>34</b> is open, additional liquor and some chips may flow in through the chute into the interior of the top separator. The screw conveyor <b>28</b> turns so as to move the chip slurry downward through the separator. A portion of the liquor in the conveyor passes through the cylindrical screen <b>30</b> and flows into an annular chamber <b>37</b> between the screen <b>30</b> and cylindrical container <b>33</b>. The extracted liquor in the chamber <b>37</b> flows through the liquor outlet pipe <b>17</b> and may be reused in the chip feed system or in another application in the pulp processing plant. The majority of the chips and liquor flowing downward through the separator are discharged out the open bottom of the separator and into the liquid filled volume of the hydraulic phase digester vessel.</p>
