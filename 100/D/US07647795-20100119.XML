<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-363825, filed Dec. 16, 2004, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a washing clothes case for storing a laundry therein on washing the laundry labeled a hand washing or a weak water flow in treatment, without damaging a shape and a fabric material of the laundry in case of washing the laundry in a strong water flow by a clothes washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a conventional art will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In washing, easy-care instructions are labeled on laundry. The laundry, which is possible to do water washing, is grouped into one of &#x201c;hand-washing&#x201d;, &#x201c;weak water flow&#x201d;, and &#x201c;strong water flow&#x201d;. Inasmuch as a clothes washing machine cannot be usually used in the laundry labeled hand-washing instruction, you can not be bothered to do a hand-washing. It is uneasy to do a hand washing without damage a shape and a fabric material of the laundry. In addition, the laundry labeled a weak water flow instruction is washed in a manner of drifting in washing water in a few minutes by a weak water flow function of the clothes washing machine. It is difficult to remove dirt from clothes and the clothes may get out of shape on dehydration in some fabric materials. Although fabric clothes such as wool and silk increase which are possible to be washed with water, a washing fashion is still defined to the hand washing or the weak water flow. As a result, there are troubles in which the number of washing increases on the basis of classification and which dissatisfaction remains in removing dirt from clothes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inasmuch as the laundry rubs by a whisking operation in washing of strong water flow and snag and twist occur in the laundry, damage occurs in the clothes and the clothes get out of shape. In order to prevent the clothes from getting out of shape, the washing net is used on washing. Inasmuch as the washing net is shaped into a net shaped bag, the laundry put in the washing net is only collected in the bags and receives a mechanical force and the water flow in operation similar to other laundry which is not put in the washing net. Therefore, it is difficult to avoid the laundry from damage in case of washing the laundry labeled the hand washing or the weak water flow, under the strong water flow by using the washing net, although the washing, which prevents the clothes from getting out of shape, is effective in weak water flow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present applicant had invented the invention described in the patent publication 1, in order to dissolve the above-mentioned problems. The clothes washing case described in the patent publication 1 is composed of a lower cover portion, an upper cover portion, and a connecting hardware. The lower cover portion has a gradual U-character shaped shallow bowl shape which is directed upwardly. The upper cover portion has a gradual inversed U-character shaped shallow bowl shape which is directed downwardly. The connecting hardware is for use in connecting the lower cover portion with the upper cover portion with the lower cover portion and the upper cover portion being possible to open and close. Each of the lower cover portion and the upper cover portion has two-layer structure which has an inner layer and an outer layer. The inner layer is a net body which is made of hard lightweight plastic. The outer layer is made of a stock absorbing material having elasticity. The outer layer is dotted with water holes. In case where the laundry is stored in the above-mentioned washing clothes case, it is possible to wash delicate clothes by the clothes washing machine without damage, without separating the delicate clothes from other clothes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. 3,111,275</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the washing clothes case described in patent publication 1 has some troubles which are described hereinafter. Inasmuch as each of the lower cover portion and the upper cover portion has two-layer structure and one of layers is shaped into a net body made of hard lightweight plastic and a plurality of water holes are formed on another one of layers, the washing clothes case is expensive on manufacture and manufacturing process becomes complex.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Taking the above-mentioned problems into consideration, it is an object of the present invention to provide a washing clothes case having a structure capable of doing a washing with a strong water flow of a clothes washing machine and capable of being manufactured at a low cost, in order to sufficiently remove dirt from delicate clothes stored in the washing clothes case, without preventing the clothes from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a washing clothes case for storing laundry therein on washing by a clothes washing machine. The washing clothes case comprises a container made of hard plastics and having at least one opening portion capable of opening and closing, a floating member attached on one of an outer surface and an inner surface of the container, and a plurality of water holes formed on a region of the container at which the floating member is not attached.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Inasmuch as the washing clothes case comprises the container made of hard plastics and having at least one opening portion capable of opening and closing, the container is not twisted on washing and the strong water flow and the mechanical force do not directly act to the laundry stored in the washing clothes case. As a result, it is possible to wash the laundry with keeping the laundry to original shape and without getting out of shape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, inasmuch the floating member is partially attached on one of the outer surface and the inner surface of the container, it is easy to make the washing clothes case float near water surface. Therefore, it is possible to reduce influence and entanglement of other laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, inasmuch as the floating member is partially attached on the container and a plurality of water holes formed on the region of the container at which the floating member is not attached, it is possible to simplify a manufacturing process and to reduce a cost in comparison to Patent Publication 1 in which the container has the two-layer structure. In addition, inasmuch as washing water passes through only the water holes, it is possible to gradually wash the stored laundry by water passing operation even if water flow is strong. Inasmuch as the release of the water is restricted on dehydration, the dehydration weakly acts to the laundry and it is possible to prevent the laundry from wrinkle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect of the present invention, a concave portion is formed on the container. The concave portion is concave with directing from the outer surface to the inner surface of the container. The floating member is engaged in the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Inasmuch as the concave portion is formed on the container and the floating member is engaged in the concave portion, it is possible to strongly fix the floating member to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a third aspect of the present invention, a continuous surface is formed by a surface of the floating member engaged in the concave portion and the outer surface of the container except the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Inasmuch as the continuous surface is formed by a surface of the floating member engaged in the concave portion and the outer surface of the container except the concave portion, it is possible to make the entire outer surface of the container be smooth surface. As a result, it is possible to further reduce influence and entanglement of other laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, roundness is formed on a corner portion of a part projecting to inside of the container in correspondence to the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Inasmuch as roundness is formed on a corner portion of a part projecting to inside of the container in correspondence to the concave portion, it is possible to prevent the stored laundry from damage based on catching and rubbing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, a shock absorber is attached to a corner portion or projection portion which is positioned on the outer surface of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Inasmuch as the shock absorber is attached to a corner portion or projection portion which is positioned on the outer surface of the container, it is possible to prevent the washing tub from damage and to reduce a sonic boom even if the washing clothes case is contact with the washing tub. As a result, it is possible to secure safety.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the container is formed by a pair of bowl shaped members which are similar in shape to each other. The bowl shaped members are opposite to each other to arrange the circumference edges in order to form the container. The container comprises hinge member for connecting the bowl shaped members capable of opening and closing and a stopping member for fixing the bowl shaped members in a closed state. The floating member is attached to a bottom portion of each of the bowl shaped members. The water holes are formed on a side wall portion of each of the bowl shaped members.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As described above, the bowl shaped members are opposite to each other to arrange the circumference edges in order to form the container and the floating member is attached to a bottom portion of each of the bowl shaped members. Furthermore, the water holes are formed on a side wall portion of each of the bowl shaped members. As a result, the washing clothes case has a shape having roundness without existing a sharp corner portion and a projection on the outer surface of the washing clothes case. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the washing clothes case from deformation based on pressure. Even if the washing clothes case is put in the washing tub together with general laundry, friction does not occur between the washing clothes case and general laundry. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the general laundry from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Inasmuch as the floating member is attached to a bottom portion of each of the bowl shaped members, it is easy to keep the bottom portion to a parallel state with respect to the water surface when the washing clothes case floats on the water surface. Therefore, the water passing is not interfered through the water holes which are formed on the side wall portion. In addition, it is possible to further reduce influence and entanglement of other laundry. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce the shock to the laundry stored in the washing clothes case.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Inasmuch as the washing clothes case comprises a structure having a storing space in the container, it is possible to effectively remove the dirt from the laundry by the strong water flow of the clothes washing machine without damaging the laundry in comparison to hand washing, because the strong water flow effectively removes the dirt from the laundry in comparison to the weak water flow. Therefore, it is unnecessary to separately wash the laundry on the basis of strength of the water flow and to carry out the hand washing. Inasmuch as it is possible to put the washing clothes case in the washing tub together with the general laundry and to simplify washing, it is possible to reduce the number of washing reduces and it is unnecessary to carry out washing at much expense in time and effort. As a result, it is possible to reduce consumption of water and electric power and to effective use time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although it is difficult to remove an aqueous dirt such as sweat from the clothes labeled a dry-mark, in a dry-cleaning, it is possible to remove the aqueous dirt such as sweat from the clothes labeled a dry-mark by the clothes washing machine when using the washing clothes case under the suited detergent. As a result, it is possible to reduce the expense for cleaning. Inasmuch as it is possible to apply the washing clothes case to a sort of clothes without limiting the delicate clothes, it is possible to restrain degradation based on washing and the clothes wears well.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A washing clothes case of the present invention has a main body or container made of hard plastics. The main body is for storing a laundry and has at least one of opening portion which is capable of opening and closing. The external shape of the container is optional. More particularly, the container is shaped into a rectangular solid, a spherical body, an elliptic body, cylinder solid, shapes partially changing these objects, or shape combining these objects. The opening portion capable of opening and closing may have, for example, an opening and closing cover which is formed a part of wall of one container. Alternatively, one container is divided into two sections which are connected to each other by a hinge, in order to be capable of opening and closing, as another example of the opening portion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The hard plastics used as a material of the container usually has a bending elastic modulus of 7000 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more in a steady state. Therefore, it is possible to use a general thermosetting resin (melamine resin, phenol resin, unsaturated polyester resin or the like), styrol resin, acrylate resin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, the washing clothes case of the present invention has a floating member which is partially attached to an outer surface or an inner surface of the container. &#x201c;Partially&#x201d; means that the floating member is not attached to entire surface of the container. The floating member is shaped into a thin film which has a thickness which is nearly equal to the wall thickness of the container. The contour of the floating member is not defined. The floating member attached to the container may be one or may be divided into a plurality of parts when obtaining sufficient buoyancy. In case where the floating member is divided into a plurality of parts, the parts are optionally located on the container. Preferably, the floating member is evenly located on the entire container. More specifically, it is preferable to symmetrically locate the floating member on the container (referring to an illustrated embodiment hereinafter) in case where the container has a symmetrical shape. On attaching the floating member on the container, the floating member may be integrated on the outer surface or the inner surface of the container. Alternatively, the floating member may be inserted in a concave portion which is formed on the wall of the container. The floating member is attached in the concave portion by bond, fusion bond, mechanical inlet or the like. In case of inserting the floating member into the concave portion of the wall of the container, the inserted floating member may project from the surface of the container or the surface of the floating member may forms a continuous surface together with the surface of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The floating member is made of material exercising buoyancy which makes the washing clothes case float on the water surface or near. The floating member is made of plastics which has specific gravity less than one. For example, the floating member is made of expanded plastics such as polypropylene, polyethylene, hard polyurethane form, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Inasmuch as the above-mentioned floating member is partially attached one the outer surface or the inner surface of the container, the floating member does not exists one a part of surface of the container. In the washing clothes case of the present invention, a plurality of water holes are formed one the part at which the floating member does not exist. The size of each water hole is defined in an upper limit to a size in which the stored laundry slips out of the water hole. The size of each water hole is defined in a lower limit to a size in which washing water smoothly flows in and flows out. Incidentally, the volume of water, which flows in and flows out of a storing space, becomes great as the total area of the water holes becomes great. As a result, the water flow pressure becomes strong with respect to the stored clothes. Therefore, the total area of the water holes is defined to a area in which damage occurs in the clothes. For example, it is preferable to make the total area of the water holes be defined to a area which is not greater than 50% of total area of outer surface of the container. Each water hole may be shaped into circle, ellipse, square, slit, or the like. Although the water holes are located on the part at which the floating member is not inserted, it is preferable to evenly locate the water holes on the surface of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In case where a square portion or a projection portion exists on the outer surface of the container, it is preferable to attach a shock absorber on the square portion or the projection portion. The square portion or the projection portion on which the shock absorber is attached is not defined to a sharp projection. Even if the square portion or the projection portion has a slight roundness, the slight roundness is included in the square portion or the projection portion when the slight roundness has a convex surface which is directed to outside. The shock absorber is for preventing a washing tub from damage and is for restraining a sonic bang in case where the washing clothes case is contact with the inner wall of the washing tub or collides with the inner wall of the washing tub. The shock absorber is made of a material having elasticity that buffers a shock. For example, the shock absorber is made of polyethylene foam, EVA resin, ABS resin, thermoplastic elastomer, or the like.</p>

Edges of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> correspond to each other and adhere to each other, in order to form a storing space therein. Each of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> has a circumference edge of circular shape. Incidentally, the size of each of the bowl shaped member <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is determined on the basis of the amount of clothes which is stored in the storing space.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in the plane view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pair of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are connected to each other by a hinge portion <b>16</b> which is mounted on a part of each circumference edge. The bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are capable of opening and closing by using the hinge portion <b>16</b> as an axis, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, in order to form the opening portion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the plane view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a stopping portion <b>17</b> is mounted on an opposite circumference edge opposite to the circumference edge at which the hinge portion <b>16</b> is mounted. The stopping portion <b>17</b> is for fixing the pair of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> in the closed condition. Incidentally, it is preferable to evenly fix the bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> by a plurality of stopping portions <b>17</b>, in case where the size of each of the bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is large.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in X-X line sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> which are similar in shape to each other have about flat bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A and side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B, respectively. The side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B are bent from the circumferences of the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A, respectively, to be directed to a vertical direction. &#x201c;about flat&#x201d; means that the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A may have a gradual curve surfaces, respectively. Accordingly, the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A are approximately parallel to each other, when the washing clothes case <b>1</b> is closed. Strict boundaries do not exist between the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A and side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B and form gradual curve surface. The side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B extend to vertical directions near the circumference with respect to the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A, respectively. Therefore, both of the side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B are connected to each other so that the side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B form a continuous surface, when the bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are contact with each other at the circumference edges.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, concave portions <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>12</b>A<b>1</b> are formed on at least parts of the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A of the pair of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively. The concave portions <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>12</b>A<b>1</b> dent from the outer side to the inner side.

In the present embodiment, the outer surface of the washing clothes case <b>1</b> becomes smooth surface when the floating members <b>13</b> is engaged into the concave portions <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>12</b>A<b>1</b>, inasmuch as the floating members <b>13</b> are similar in shape to the concave portions <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>12</b>A<b>1</b>. The size of the floating member <b>13</b> is determined to a size in which sufficient buoyancy is obtained. Namely, the area and the depth of each of the concave portions <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>12</b>A<b>1</b> is determined to an area and a depth in which sufficient buoyancy is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present embodiment, the floating member <b>13</b> has a shape which is preferably symmetric with respect a center of each of the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A. As a result, balanced buoyancy is obtained which makes the washing clothes case <b>1</b> float in a level approximately parallel to the water surface. In addition, the floating members <b>13</b> may extend to the side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B without the locating range is not defined to the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A, although the floating members <b>13</b> are located on at least parts of the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A. The floating member <b>13</b> may be divided into a plurality of floating portions and the floating portions may be evenly located on the outer surface of the washing clothes case <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Inasmuch as the pair of floating members <b>13</b> are engaged into the pair of approximate flat bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A of the washing clothes case <b>1</b> as described above, each of the floating members <b>13</b> makes the washing clothes case <b>1</b> be positioned to approximately parallel to the water surface when the washing clothes case <b>1</b> is put in the washing tub. As a result, the washing clothes case <b>1</b> receives the water flow and floats on the water surface with maintaining a parallel state near the water surface.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, a plurality of water holes are formed on the pair of bowl shaped member <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> which are form the washing clothes case <b>1</b>. The water holes penetrate the region at which the floating members <b>13</b> are not engaged. For example, a plurality of water holes <b>15</b>A dot a central regions of the bottom portions <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A. A plurality of water holes <b>15</b>B dot the side wall portions <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A shock absorber <b>14</b> is mounted on the outer side of each circumference edge of the pair of bowl shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Remarks will be described hereinafter with respect to the washing conditions A to D.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A: Inasmuch as the washing net drifts on the washing water with water flow being very weak, it is difficult to remove the dirt from laundry. In addition, it is noted that the laundry is damaged on the mechanical force based on dehydration inasmuch as strong dehydration is carried out during a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">B: It is possible to remove the dirt from the laundry very well on the basis of operations of tossing, rubbing, and twisting. However, it is noted that the laundry is greatly damaged in comparison to dirt removal.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">C: When the laundry stored in the washing net is becomes a packed condition; it is difficult to evenly remove the dirt from the laundry. In addition, even if the laundry is collected in the bag, it is difficult to avoid the operations of tossing, rubbing, and twisting and it is difficult to buffer the mechanical force. The laundry gets out of shape.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">D: Inasmuch as dirt is removed from the laundry by the water flow without the operations of tossing, rubbing, and twisting, it is possible to remove thick dirt of starch shape from the laundry by the pretreatment. Inasmuch as the laundry stored in the washing clothes case directly receives the mechanical force and influence of other clothes till washing to dehydration, it is possible to prevent the laundry from getting out of shape.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, it is possible to obtain a good result with respect to both of the dirt removal and the shape, in case of storing the laundry in the washing clothes case of the present invention and washing the laundry under the strong water flow.</p>
