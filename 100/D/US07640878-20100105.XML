<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed generally toward devices and methods for coupling an embroidery accessory to an embroidery machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embroidery is generally used to create a decorative design or pattern on a piece of fabric. The fabric may be composed of any material, such as cotton, wool, polyester, plastic, silk, velvet, linen, or any other material capable of being stitched. A pattern may be embroidered onto the piece of fabric using an embroidery machine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embroidery machines lessen the amount of time and labor that is necessary to embroider an item by automating the embroidery process. For example, embroidery designs may be embedded in files that are loaded onto a computer. An embroidery machine may then communicate with the computer and embroider the designs that are contained on the files.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embroidery machines require the use of an embroidery accessory in order to embroider a pattern onto fabric. The fabric is mounted onto the embroidery accessory so that the head of the embroidery machine may embroider the pattern on the fabric. Stabilizer or other types of backing may also be mounted on the embroidery accessory. Some embroidery accessories that are currently available for use with embroidery machines include cap devices, frames, or a set of arms.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, attaching one of the currently available embroidery accessories to an embroidery machine can be cumbersome and time-consuming. For example, most current embroidery accessories must be bolted directly onto the pantograph of the embroidery machine. These types of embroidery accessories require an operator to bolt or unbolt embroidery accessories to and from the pantograph each time a new embroidery accessory is used, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. This cumbersome and time-consuming method decreases the efficiency at which patterns may be embroidered onto pieces of fabric. Current methods for attaching and detaching embroidery accessories to and from an embroidery machine also require the use of one or more tools, such as a screwdriver or wrench. The need for additional tools presents an additional inconvenience of the current method for coupling and decoupling an embroidery accessory to and from an embroidery machine.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The illustrative embodiments described herein are directed toward an apparatus and method for coupling an embroidery accessory to an embroidery machine. As used herein, the term &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; includes coupling via a separate object. For example, an embroidery accessory can be coupled to an embroidery machine if both the embroidery accessory and the embroidery machine are coupled to a third object. The term &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; also includes &#x201c;directly coupling,&#x201d; in which case the two objects touch each other in some way. The apparatus includes a support bar. The support bar is coupled to the embroidery machine. The apparatus also includes a set of acceptors. The set of acceptors includes one or more acceptors. The set of acceptors are attached to the support bar. The apparatus also includes an embroidery accessory. The embroidery accessory includes a set of attachment adapters. The set of attachment adapters include one or more attachment adapters, and are adapted to be coupled to the set of acceptors.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an apparatus for coupling an embroidery accessory to an embroidery machine is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b>, which is implemented on embroidery machine <b>212</b>, which is an example of embroidery machine <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> includes pantograph <b>210</b>, which is a non-limiting example of pantograph <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Pantograph <b>210</b> may be coupled to embroidery machine <b>212</b> in a similar manner as pantograph <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, pantograph <b>210</b> may be bolted, screwed, snapped, welded, or glued onto embroidery machine <b>212</b>. Pantograph <b>210</b> may be any length and may be composed of any material, such as metal or plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> includes support bar <b>215</b>, which may be coupled to embroidery machine <b>212</b>. In one embodiment, support bar <b>215</b> is coupled to embroidery machine <b>212</b> by pantograph <b>210</b>. Pantograph <b>210</b> includes pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b>, which is used for mounting support bar <b>215</b> onto pantograph <b>210</b>. Support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b>, which are attached to support bar <b>215</b>, may be adjoined to pantograph <b>210</b> using mounting bolts <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>. Support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> are used to couple support bar <b>215</b> to pantograph <b>210</b>. Mounting bolt <b>222</b> couples support bar mount <b>217</b> to pantograph <b>210</b> at pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b>. Similarly, mounting bolt <b>224</b> couples support bar mount <b>219</b> to pantograph <b>210</b> at pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b>, any number of support bar mounts may be attached to support bar <b>215</b>. For example, support bar <b>215</b> may include one, three, or ten support bar mounts that may be used to mount support bar <b>215</b> to pantograph <b>210</b>. Also, support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may be coupled to pantograph <b>210</b> in any of a variety of ways. For example, support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may be screwed, welded, glued, interlocked, magnetically coupled, or contiguous with pantograph <b>210</b>. The term &#x201c;contiguous,&#x201d; as used herein, includes two components that are connected without any visible boundary. For example, support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> and pantograph <b>210</b> may form part of the same structure and have no visible boundary between them.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may be slidably or hingably coupled to pantograph <b>210</b>. For example, support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may be shaped such that they may be inserted into pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b> and slid along the length of pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b>. Support bar <b>215</b> or support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may include a button, lever, latch, or other similar device to prevent support bar <b>215</b> from sliding or hinging relative to pantograph <b>210</b>. This button, lever, latch, or other similar device prevents support bar <b>215</b> from moving relative to pantograph <b>210</b> when the embroidery machine is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although support bar <b>215</b> is shown coupled to pantograph <b>210</b> via support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b>, support bar <b>215</b> may be coupled to pantograph <b>210</b> in a variety of ways. For example, support bar <b>215</b> may be directly attached to pantograph <b>210</b> without the use of support bar mounts <b>217</b> and <b>219</b>. In this example, support bar <b>215</b> may be directly bolted, screwed, welded, glued, interlocked, or magnetically coupled to pantograph <b>210</b>. In another example, pantograph <b>210</b> and support bar <b>215</b> form one contiguous device, thereby eliminating the need to couple support bar <b>215</b> to pantograph <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another example, support bar <b>215</b> may be slidably or hingably coupled to pantograph <b>210</b>. For example, support bar <b>215</b> may be shaped to allow insertion into pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b> and slid along the length of pantograph mounting notch <b>213</b>. In this example, support bar <b>215</b> may include a button, lever, latch, or other similar device to prevent support bar <b>215</b> from sliding or hinging relative to pantograph <b>210</b>. This button, lever, latch, or other similar device prevents support bar <b>215</b> from moving relative to pantograph <b>210</b> when the embroidery machine is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Support bar <b>215</b> may be composed of any material that is able to support embroidery accessory <b>225</b>, such as metal, plastic, wood, or any combination thereof. Support bar <b>215</b> may also be magnetic. In addition, support bar <b>215</b> may have any shape or length. For example, support bar <b>215</b> may have a square, elliptical, or triangular shape of any size. The material composition, shape, and length of support bar <b>215</b> may depend on a variety of factors, such as the structure of embroidery machine <b>212</b> and the ability of support bar <b>215</b> to support embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. For example, the material composition and length of support bar <b>215</b> may depend on the size, structure, and composition of pantograph <b>210</b> or embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. The material composition and length of support bar <b>215</b> may also depend on cost, labor, weight, durability, and shipping considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> also includes acceptor <b>230</b>. Acceptor <b>230</b> is attached to support bar <b>215</b>. Acceptor <b>230</b> may be attached to support bar <b>215</b> at any location along support bar <b>215</b>, such as the center or one of the ends of support bar <b>215</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a single acceptor <b>230</b>, any number of acceptors may be attached to support bar <b>215</b>, such as two, three, or five.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although acceptor <b>230</b> is shown as a rectangular prism, acceptor <b>230</b> may have any shape, such as cube, elliptical cylinder, circular cylinder, or triangular prism. Also, acceptor <b>230</b> may be composed of any of a variety of materials, such as metal, plastic, wood, or any combination thereof. Acceptor <b>230</b> may also be magnetic. Acceptor <b>230</b> may also be coupled to support bar <b>215</b> in a variety of ways. For example, acceptor <b>230</b> may be bolted, screwed, welded, glued, hinged, or snapped onto support bar <b>215</b>. In addition, acceptor <b>230</b> may be magnetically coupled to support bar <b>215</b>, such as in the example in which either or both acceptor <b>230</b> or support bar <b>215</b> are made of a magnetic material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The shape, composition, and method of attaching acceptor <b>230</b> may be based on a number of considerations, such as the structure of embroidery machine <b>212</b> or support bar <b>215</b> and the ability of acceptor <b>230</b> to support or receive embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. For example, the material composition and shape of acceptor <b>230</b> may depend on the size, structure, and composition of support bar <b>215</b> or embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. The material composition and length of acceptor <b>230</b> may also depend on cost, labor, weight, durability, and shipping considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> also includes magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>. In one embodiment, magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are disposed between support bar <b>215</b> and acceptor <b>230</b>. Magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> both have cylindrical shapes. However, magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> may have any shape, such as a cube, rectangular prism, ring, elliptical cylinder, or triangular prism. Magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> may be composed of any material that is capable of being magnetic.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> may have any number of magnets, such as one, six, or eleven. For example, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> may include two magnets for each acceptor that is attached to support bar <b>215</b>. Thus, in the example in which two acceptors are attached to support bar <b>215</b>, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> would include four magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> includes magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b>. Magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> are any structure capable of affecting the position of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>. In one embodiment, magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> are disposed on acceptor <b>230</b>. Each of magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> are adapted to hold or contain one of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>. For example, magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> restrain the movement of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> such that magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are disposed at a particular location relative to support bar <b>215</b> and acceptor <b>230</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that magnet notch <b>245</b> is adapted to hold magnet <b>235</b> into a particular position and that magnet notch <b>250</b> is adapted to hold magnet <b>240</b> into a particular position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although acceptor <b>230</b> is shown as including two magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b>, acceptor <b>230</b> may have any number of magnet notches. For example, acceptor <b>230</b> may have a single magnet notch that is adapted for holding any number of magnets into a particular position. Also, magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> may have any shape and size that is capable of maintaining the position of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> into a particular position. Hence, in one embodiment, the shape of magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> depends on the shape and structure of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> includes attachment adapter <b>255</b>. Specifically, attachment adapter <b>255</b> is attached to embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. In one embodiment, attachment adapter <b>255</b> is contiguous with the structure of embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. However, attachment adapter <b>255</b> may also be a separate structure that is coupled to embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. For example, attachment adapter <b>255</b> may be bolted, screwed, welded, glued, or hinged to embroidery accessory <b>225</b>. Attachment adapter <b>255</b> and embroidery accessory <b>225</b> may have complementary interlocking structures such that attachment adapter <b>255</b> may be snapped onto embroidery accessory <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Attachment adapter <b>255</b> includes adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>. Adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> are holes or grooves that allow embroidery accessory <b>225</b> to be held or gripped by acceptor <b>230</b> and magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>. Although adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> have rectangular shape, adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> have any shape, such as square, elliptical, circular, or triangular. In one embodiment, the shape of adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> has the same shape or follows the contours of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also, although attachment adapter <b>255</b> includes two adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>, attachment adapter <b>255</b> may include any number of adapter notches, such as one, three, or ten. In one embodiment, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> has the same number of magnets, magnet notches, and adapter notches. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> as having two magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>, two magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b>, and two adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>. In a different example, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> may have two magnets, one magnet notch, and one adapter notch.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are adapted to be inserted into adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>, respectively. The term &#x201c;inserted&#x201d; is here used to mean that all or a portion of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> cross into a space defined by adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>. In another embodiment, magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are &#x201c;inserted&#x201d; into adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> when magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are fitted or partially fitted into a space defined by adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Attachment adapter <b>255</b> may be inserted into acceptor notch <b>270</b>. Acceptor notch <b>270</b> is a space included in acceptor <b>230</b> that allows acceptor <b>230</b> to receive attachment adapter <b>255</b>. Upon inserting attachment adapter <b>255</b> into acceptor notch <b>270</b>, magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> are inserted into adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, the magnetic attraction between magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> and support bar <b>215</b>, which traverses the space defined by adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>, holds attachment adapter <b>255</b> firmly into place. The position of attachment adapter <b>255</b> may also be held into place by the magnetic attraction between magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>, acceptor <b>230</b> and attachment adapter <b>255</b>. Embroidery accessory <b>225</b> is also supported by lip <b>275</b>, which prevents embroidery accessory <b>225</b> from moving in a downward vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, embroidery accessory coupling system <b>200</b> allows embroidery accessory <b>225</b> to be quickly inserted into and held firmly into place by embroidery machine <b>212</b> without the use of tools, such as screwdrivers and wrenches. Embroidery accessory <b>225</b> may also be quickly decoupled from embroidery machine <b>212</b>. For example, attachment adapter <b>255</b> may be pulled with sufficient force to overcome the magnetic attraction of magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b>. In this example, sufficient room is provided by magnet notches <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> for magnets <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> to be removed from the space defined by adapter notches <b>260</b> and <b>265</b>, thereby allowing attachment adapter <b>255</b> to be removed from acceptor notch <b>270</b>.</p>
