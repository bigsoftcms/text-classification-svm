<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to washing machines, and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for rinsing washing machines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Washing machines typically include a cabinet that houses an outer tub for containing wash and rinse water, a perforated clothes basket within the tub, and an agitator within the basket. A drive and motor assembly is mounted underneath the stationary outer tub to rotate the clothes basket and the agitator relative to one another, and a pump assembly pumps water from the tub to a drain to execute a wash cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditionally, rinse portions of wash cycles include a deep-fill process wherein articles in the clothes basket are completely submerged in water and the water is agitated. As such, a large amount of water mixes with detergent remaining in the clothes after they are washed. While the concentration of detergent in the water is relatively small, a large amount of detergent can be removed from the clothes due to the large amount of water involved. It has become increasingly desirable, however, to reduce water consumption in washing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At least some types of washing machines have reduced water consumption in rinsing operation by using re-circulating rinse water flow. In this type of system, rinse water is collected in a bottom of the tub and pumped back to spray nozzles located above the basket. The rinse water is re-circulated for a predetermined length of time before being discharged to drain. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,722. While such systems are effective to reduce water consumption, they increase costs of the machine by employing valves, pumps, conduits, etc. that may result in additional material and assembly costs. In addition, such systems may not decrease the amount of detergent concentrations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a washing machine is provided. The washing machine includes a tub, a sensor operatively coupled to the tub and configured to sense a conductivity of a fluid in the tub and a controller operatively coupled to the sensor for controlling an amount of the fluid in the tub based on the conductivity of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a method for controlling the fluid level in a washing machine having a tub for holding a fluid is provided. The method includes sensing a conductivity of the fluid with a sensor during a wash cycle and rinsing the tub of the washing machine with the fluid based on the conductivity of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further aspect, a control system for a washing machine is provided. The washing machine includes a tub for holding a fluid. The control system is configured to sense the conductivity of the fluid, measure an average conductivity of the fluid, and rinse based on the conductivity of the fluid.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view partially broken away of an exemplary washing machine <b>50</b> including a cabinet <b>52</b> and a cover <b>54</b>. A backsplash <b>56</b> extends from cover <b>54</b>, and a control panel <b>58</b> including a plurality of input selectors <b>60</b> is coupled to backsplash <b>56</b>. Control panel <b>58</b> and input selectors <b>60</b> collectively form a user interface input for operator selection of machine cycles and features, and, in one embodiment, a display <b>61</b> indicates selected features, a countdown timer, and other items of interest to machine users. A lid <b>62</b> is mounted to cover <b>54</b> and is rotatable about a hinge (not shown) between an open position (not shown) facilitating access to a wash tub <b>64</b> located within cabinet <b>52</b>, and a closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) forming a sealed enclosure over wash tub <b>64</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, machine <b>50</b> is a vertical axis washing machine, however, it is contemplated that the benefit of the invention accrue to other types of washing machines indicating horizontal axis machines, and, therefore, as used herein, the term washing machine refers to both vertical axis and horizontal axis machines and the term tub refer to bath a tub for a vertical axis machine and a tab for a horizontal axis machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Tub <b>64</b> includes a bottom wall <b>66</b> and a sidewall <b>68</b>. A basket <b>70</b> is rotatably mounted within wash tub <b>64</b>. A pump assembly <b>72</b> is located beneath tub <b>64</b> and basket <b>70</b> for gravity assisted flow when draining tub <b>64</b>. Pump assembly <b>72</b> includes a pump <b>74</b> and a motor <b>76</b>. A pump inlet hose <b>80</b> extends from a wash tub outlet <b>82</b> in tub bottom wall <b>66</b> to a pump inlet <b>84</b>, and a pump outlet hose <b>86</b> extends from a pump outlet <b>88</b> to an appliance washing machine water outlet <b>90</b> and ultimately to a building plumbing system discharge line (not shown) in flow communication with outlet <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front elevational schematic view of washing machine <b>50</b> including wash basket <b>70</b> movably disposed and rotatably mounted in wash tub <b>64</b> in a spaced apart relationship from tub side wall <b>64</b> and tub bottom <b>66</b>. Basket <b>12</b> includes a plurality of perforations therein to facilitate fluid communication between an interior of basket <b>70</b> and wash tub <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A hot liquid valve <b>102</b> and a cold liquid valve <b>104</b> deliver fluid, such as water, to basket <b>70</b> and wash tub <b>64</b> through a respective hot liquid hose <b>106</b> and a cold liquid hose <b>108</b>. Liquid valves <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and liquid hoses <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> together form a liquid supply connection for washing machine <b>50</b> and, when connected to a building plumbing system (not shown), provide a fresh water supply for use in washing machine <b>50</b>. Liquid valves <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and liquid hoses <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are connected to a basket inlet tube <b>110</b>, and fluid is dispersed from inlet tube <b>110</b> through a known nozzle assembly <b>112</b> having a number of openings therein to direct washing liquid into basket <b>70</b> at a given trajectory and velocity. A known dispenser (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), may also be provided to produce a wash solution by mixing fresh water with a known detergent or other composition for cleansing of articles in basket <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an alternative embodiment, a known spray fill conduit <b>114</b> (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be employed in lieu of nozzle assembly <b>112</b>. Along the length of the spray fill conduit <b>114</b> are a plurality of openings arranged in a predetermined pattern to direct incoming streams of water in a downward tangential manner towards articles in basket <b>70</b>. The openings in spray fill conduit <b>114</b> are located a predetermined distance apart from one another to produce an overlapping coverage of liquid streams into basket <b>70</b>. Articles in basket <b>70</b> may therefore be uniformly wetted even when basket <b>70</b> is maintained in a stationary position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A known agitation element <b>116</b>, such as a vane agitator, impeller, auger, or oscillatory basket mechanism, or some combination thereof is disposed in basket <b>70</b> to impart an oscillatory motion to articles and liquid in basket <b>70</b>. In different embodiments, agitation element <b>116</b> may be a single action element (i.e., oscillatory only), double action (oscillatory movement at one end, single direction rotation at the other end) or triple action (oscillatory movement plus single direction rotation at one end, singe direction rotation at the other end). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, agitation element <b>116</b> is oriented to rotate about a vertical axis <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Basket <b>70</b> and agitator <b>116</b> are driven by motor <b>120</b> through a transmission and clutch system <b>122</b>. A transmission belt <b>124</b> is coupled to respective pulleys of a motor output shaft <b>126</b> and a transmission input shaft <b>128</b>. Thus, as motor output shaft <b>126</b> is rotated, transmission input shaft <b>128</b> is also rotated. Clutch system <b>122</b> facilitates driving engagement of basket <b>70</b> and agitation element <b>116</b> for rotatable movement within wash tub <b>64</b>, and clutch system <b>122</b> facilitates relative rotation of basket <b>70</b> and agitation element <b>116</b> for selected portions of wash cycles. Motor <b>120</b>, transmission and clutch system <b>122</b> and belt <b>124</b> collectively are referred herein as a machine drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Washing machine <b>50</b> also includes a brake assembly (not shown) selectively applied or released for respectively maintaining basket <b>70</b> in a stationary position within tub <b>64</b> or for allowing basket <b>70</b> to spin within tub <b>64</b>. Pump assembly <b>72</b> is selectively activated, in the example embodiment, to remove liquid from basket <b>70</b> and tub <b>64</b> through drain outlet <b>90</b> and a drain valve <b>130</b> during appropriate points in washing cycles as machine <b>50</b> is used. In an exemplary embodiment, machine <b>50</b> also includes a reservoir <b>132</b>, a tube <b>134</b> and a pressure sensor <b>136</b>. As fluid levels rise in wash tub <b>64</b>, air is trapped in reservoir <b>132</b> creating a pressure in tube <b>134</b> that pressure sensor <b>136</b> monitors. Liquid levels, and more specifically, changes in liquid levels in wash tub <b>64</b> may therefore be sensed, for example, to indicate laundry loads and to facilitate associated control decisions. In further and alternative embodiments, load size and cycle effectiveness may be determined or evaluated using other known indicia, such as motor spin, torque, load weight, motor current, and voltage or current phase shifts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Operation of machine <b>50</b> is controlled by a controller <b>138</b> which is operatively coupled to the user interface input located on washing machine backsplash <b>56</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for user manipulation to select washing machine cycles and features. In response to user manipulation of the user interface input, controller <b>138</b> operates the various components of machine <b>50</b> to execute selected machine cycles and features.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an illustrative embodiment, clothes are loaded into basket <b>70</b>, and washing operation is initiated through operator manipulation of control input selectors <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Tub <b>64</b> is filled with water and mixed with detergent to form a wash fluid, and basket <b>70</b> is agitated with agitation element <b>116</b> for cleansing of clothes in basket <b>70</b>. That is, agitation element is moved back and forth in an oscillatory back and forth motion. In the illustrated embodiment, agitation element <b>116</b> is rotated clockwise a specified amount about the vertical axis of the machine, and then rotated counterclockwise by a specified amount. The clockwise/counterclockwise reciprocating motion is sometimes referred to as a stroke, and the agitation phase of the wash cycle constitutes a number of strokes in sequence. Acceleration and deceleration of agitation element <b>116</b> during the strokes imparts mechanical energy to articles in basket <b>70</b> for cleansing action. The strokes may be obtained in different embodiments with a reversing motor, a reversible clutch, or other known reciprocating mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After the agitation phase of the wash cycle is completed, tub <b>64</b> is drained with pump assembly <b>72</b>. Clothes are then rinsed and portions of the cycle repeated, including the agitation phase, depending on the particulars of the wash cycle selected by a user.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conductivity of wash liquid is linearly proportional to detergent concentration. A first data point <b>157</b> is calculated at a start of a washing cycle based on an acceptable change percentage. In one embodiment, an acceptable change percentage is from 85% to 95%. In another embodiment, an acceptable change percentage is about 90%. A second data point <b>158</b> is calculated after a final rinse of the washing cycle. In one embodiment, second data point <b>158</b> assumes an initial 4.5 g/gal concentration. An acceptable change magnitude <b>159</b> is the difference between first and second data points <b>157</b> and <b>158</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To measure across large variations in conductivity, such as 1000 to 0.1 u-Siemen, resistor <b>164</b> may to be as large as 6.0 mega-ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Resistivity/conductivity sensor <b>162</b> is capable of sensing a change in conductivity between the wash liquid and the acceptable rinse concentration. Non-contacting toroidal conductivity technology may be used in situations with corrosion and/or soap residue buildup. At a preset change limit, such as 99% from final wash to final rinse, the rinse operation can be terminated with an optimum amount of water. The acceptance limit does not compare against an absolute conductivity measurement, but rather against the change in conductivity levels, since water purity levels, contaminants, soap brands, clothing, etc all have a bearing on the absolute conductivity level of the wash/rinse solution.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Acceptable residual detergent levels can be derived based on current production performance and consumer surveys. In the case of hypersensitive individuals, rinse selections are provided as a feature to reduce residual detergent levels below normal levels. This acceptance level can then be translated back to an acceptable percentage change in conductivity between initial &#x201c;pristine&#x201d; conductivity and the final wash liquid conductivity, or second data point <b>159</b>. Conditions with very high detergent concentration levels may utilize some consumer input to properly rinse out detergent to recommended levels.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Acceptable residual detergent levels are determined by positioning sensor <b>162</b> in contact with the wash liquid. In one embodiment, sensor <b>162</b> is positioned within tub <b>64</b>. In another embodiment, sensor <b>162</b> is positioned outside tub <b>64</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, acceptable residual detergent levels are determined by placing sensor <b>162</b> below tub <b>64</b> and above drain pump <b>72</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In one embodiment, sensor <b>162</b> is a corrosion/buildup resistant sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a process flow diagram of an exemplary method in the form of an algorithm <b>170</b> executable by controller <b>138</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for achieving optimal fluid level, such as water level, and detergent concentrations in tub <b>64</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Algorithm <b>170</b> may be a user selected option, such as through user manipulation of one of input selectors <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or may be automatically activated or deactivated by machine controls in various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After sensor <b>162</b> is installed, the wash cycle is selected <b>180</b> and washer <b>50</b> is engaged to run through an initialization mode (no detergent) to measure <b>182</b> initial conductivity of the water supplied to washer <b>50</b> from either hot or cold liquid valves <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. After the initial run, running washer <b>50</b> without detergent will no longer be necessary, because the washer <b>50</b> will store the level of conductivity left in the residual water within the drain outlet <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Washer <b>50</b> operates <b>184</b> in a normal wash mode. Before the draining and spinning of tub <b>64</b> at the end of the wash cycle, an average fluid conductivity is measured <b>186</b>. In one embodiment, the average fluid conductivity is measured over a 3-6 second sampling period. In another embodiment, the average fluid conductivity is measured over at least a 7 second sampling period. Washer <b>50</b> drains and spinouts <b>190</b> the water out of tub <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The difference between the initial &#x201c;pristine&#x201d; conductivity and the final wash liquid conductivity or achievable rinse level <b>160</b> is then calculated <b>192</b>. At predetermined water levels during rinse and spinout operations <b>194</b>, the average conductivity is measured <b>196</b> and the overall change of conductivity is calculated <b>198</b>. The overall change of conductivity is compared <b>200</b> with achievable rinse level <b>160</b>. Empirical testing under various conditions, such as water quality, soap brands, wash detergent levels, temperature, clothing material, and load quantity, may show that the initial increment of rinse water may be larger than the remaining increments. For example, it may require 5 gallons minimum to reach the rinse specification limit regardless of conditions. If the overall change of conductivity exceeds <b>210</b> an acceptable change percentage of achievable rinse level <b>160</b>, then washer <b>50</b> drains and spinouts <b>212</b> the water and the rinse operations are ceased after a final spinout. If the measured change percentage does not exceed the acceptable change percentage <b>216</b>, then rinse procedures are repeated <b>218</b>. During the rinsing procedures <b>218</b>, the water is added in a predetermined increment, such as one gallon. An average conductivity is measured <b>220</b>, until the measured change exceeds the acceptable change.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary washer, which fills the tub to pre-selected level (e.g. 15 gallons for super capacity levels), the conductivity change would be noted after some period of cloth agitation/stirring. If the change has not exceeded the acceptable limit, then water would be added in small increments until an acceptable limit is met or some upper water level limit is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, a washer, such as a spray rinse washer has spray rinse cycles, whereby the conductivity levels would be monitored during each spray rinse cycle. Once the acceptable change is met, the rinse operation would be terminated. If the acceptable change is not met, the spray rinse operations are continued in small increments until the change limit is met or an upper water use limit is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The herein describes adaptive rinse methods and apparatus actively monitors soap residue methods as opposed to conservatively over-rinsing the clothes. Additionally, the herein described adaptive rinse methods and apparatus also provides an ability to enhance rinse performance for cases where people are ultra-sensitive to soap residue.</p>
