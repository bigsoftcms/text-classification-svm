<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of composite compounds of mineral or organic fillers or pigments containing at least two mineral or organic fillers or pigments of different natures and the uses thereof in the paper industry for manufacturing paper, for filling or coating purposes, or for any other surface treatment of the paper, as well as in the field of aqueous and non-aqueous paints and in the plastics industry.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Description of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Composite pigments or fillers are commonly used these days for the manufacture of all types of paper, filling and coating or any other surface treatment of the paper in order to improve the quality of the paper in terms of its properties of opacity, whiteness and brightness of the sheets of paper, for example, or to improve the printability characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">One widely used technique of producing composite pigments or fillers consists in mixing a mineral filler, such as a natural calcium carbonate for example, with a mineral filler such as talc (FR 2 526 061) or alternatively a mineral filler such as talc with another mineral filler such as calcined kaolin (EP 0 365 502).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Two other types of process are also known from the prior art for producing composite pigments or fillers meeting the requisite criteria for use in the paper industry.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">A first category of these processes known from the prior art involves forming networks between the pigment particles, thereby creating numerous internal voids which then enhance the optical properties of the pigment fillers, often measured by a light scattering coefficient S.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Accordingly, patent WO 92/08755 describes a method of forming aggregates by flocculation and optionally by in situ precipitation of calcium carbonate, this flocculation occurring consecutively with the ionic interactions produced by using anionic polymers with a high molecular weight to flocculate the mineral particles to which multivalent cations such as the calcium ion are added on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Similarly, patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,449,402 discloses a product obtained by a method of creating internal voids based on ionic or electrostatic interactions, whilst U.S. Pat. No. 5,454,864 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,487 or EP 0 573 150 propose a composite pigment, the preparation of which is based on the attraction forces of ions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">These methods based on ionic attraction forces are sensitive to the ionic forces at play in the formulas used for paper coating colors or for paper filling and there is no guarantee that these pigments can be used in applications such as paper coating or paper filling.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">A second category of these methods known from the prior art as a means of producing pigments with improved optical characteristics is based on using organic compounds of silicon (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,818,294; 5,458,680) or chloride-based compounds (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,820,554; 4,826,536; WO 97/24406).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Finally, a last known method of improving whiteness (WO 97/32934) consists in coating the pigment particles with another pigment particle such as very fine particles of precipitated calcium carbonate. However, a method of this type is not based on using an organic binding agent which creates a co-structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">Faced with this problem of improving optical properties, such as opacity, whiteness, colouring or brightness, for example, or improving printability characteristics, the applicant has developed, for the- purposes of this invention, composite compounds, which are dry or non-aqueous or aqueous, of mineral or organic fillers or pigments which will improve at least one of the optical properties or printability required in the various fields of application, whilst providing a macroscopically homogeneous and stable compound in spite of the ionic forces present in the known formulas, such as offset or rotogravure paper coating colors or paper filling.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">Consequently, throughout this description the words co-structure or co-structured or co-adsorbed are used by the applicant as meaning the creation of a bond between at least two fillers or pigments of any type by forming a structure comparable to a bond or an adhesion between the surface of a filler or pigment having at least one hydrophilic site and the surface of the other filler or pigment having at least one organophilic site using a binding agent which is an organic compound. This binder may be supported by a gas such as air or any other gas.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Furthermore, another objective of the invention is to develop stable composite compounds which can be transported and stored for several weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">Yet another objective of the invention is to develop a composite compound of a macroscopically homogeneous structure, this being achieved by macroscopically stable paper coating colors which contain the above-mentioned composite aqueous compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Moreover, another objective of the invention is the use of these composite compounds as organic or mineral fillers or pigments for the manufacture of paper, filling and/or coating and/or any other compound used to treat the surface of paper, as well as in the field of paints and the field of plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Finally, another objective of the invention is to provide suspensions containing the composite compounds proposed by the invention and to provide paper coating colors or compounds for treating the surface of paper or uncoated filling compounds that will improve at least one of the properties, such as opacity, whiteness, brightness or printability.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">It should be pointed out that the improvement made to these properties will depend on the field in which the skilled person wishes to adapt the properties to suit the desired application.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">These objectives are achieved by placing the surface of one of the pigments or fillers in contact with the surface of the other of the pigments or fillers in the presence of a binding agent so that this contact causes a structure to form, between at least two mineral or organic particles of a different physical or chemical nature, i.e. causes a structure to form between them, at least one of them having a surface with at least one hydrophilic site and at least one of them having a surface with at least one organophilic site.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">By mineral or organic particle having a surface with at least one hydrophilic site, the applicant means a mineral or organic particle which is partially or totally wettable by polar substances without the influence of any external component and more specifically is partially or totally wettable by water.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">The mineral or organic particles having a surface with at least one hydrophilic site may be of very different physical or chemical natures, such as natural calcium carbonate, for example chalk, calcite, marble or any other form of natural calcium carbonate, which may be obtained from a recycling process in particular, precipitated calcium carbonate, the dolomites, crystalline or amorphous aluminium hydroxides, natural or synthetic precipitated silicates, calcium sulphate, titanium dioxide, satin white, the wollastonites, huntite, calcined clays derived from recycling for example, starch or any other type of organophilic organic or mineral particles that have undergone physical processing such as Corona or chemical processing in order to produce at least one hydrophilic site.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">By mineral or organic particle having a surface with at least one organophilic site, the applicant means a mineral or organic particle which is partially or totally wettable by an organic fluid or an organic substance, this wettability being independent of adsorption mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction or sequestration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">By mineral or organic particle having a surface with at least one organophilic site, the applicant means in particular a mineral or organic particle of very different physical or chemical natures such as talcs, micas, calcined clays or not, or zinc oxide or transparent iron pigments or colouring pigments such as phthalocyanine blue, polystyrene-based synthetic pigments, urea-formol resins, carbon black, cellulose fibres and flours or any other type of hydrophilic mineral or organic particles but which, after chemical or physical processing, have at least one organophilic site, i.e. are wettable by an organic fluid or an organic substance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">It should be pointed out that the quantities and ratios by dry weight of the various fillers or pigments making up the composite compounds proposed by the invention vary from 0.1% to 99.9% depending on the nature of the different pigments or fillers, and preferably from 25% to 95% by dry weight, relative to the total dry weight of the fillers or pigments, of mineral or organic fillers or pigments having a surface with at least one hydrophilic site and preferably between 75% and 5% by dry weight, relative to the total dry weight of the fillers or pigments, of mineral or organic fillers or pigments having a surface with at least one organophilic site.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The creation of a bond or a co-structure can be seen in the Theological behaviour of the composite compounds and by the properties of homogeneity in paper coating colors or in the printability of the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">It also increases the opacity of sheets of wood free paper filled at a rate of 75.5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>with the composite compounds of the invention. This opacity is measured in compliance with the DIN 53146 standard using an Elrepho 2000 spectrophotometer made by Datacolor AG (Switzerland).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">Accordingly, the composite compounds of mineral or organic fillers or pigments proposed by the invention are characterised in that they are co-structured or co-adsorbed, i.e. they have a high yield stress, as determined by a Stress Tech&#xae; machine, namely higher than and preferably at least four times higher than that of the standard mixture of corresponding fillers or pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">The composite compounds of mineral or organic fillers or pigments proposed by the invention are also characterised in that the different mineral or organic particles exhibit a cohesion which reflects the macroscopic homogeneity of the suspension of the composite compound and/or coating color containing the composite compound. This macroscopic homogeneity is expressed by measuring the content of one of the pigments or fillers at two different points of the suspension or of the coating color after it has been left to rest for several hours or several days.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">Furthermore, the composite compounds of mineral or organic fillers or pigments proposed by the invention are characterised in that they contain at least one binding agent. This binding agent is an organic compound, which might be supported by a gas such as air or any other gas. This binding agent, an organic compound, must be partially or totally wettable by the surfaces of the pigments or fillers with which it is placed in contact. By preference, this binding agent is selected from among the acrylic or vinyl polymers and/or copolymers or polycondensates or polyaddition products such as the polymers or copolymers for example, in their totally acid state or partially neutralized or totally neutralized by neutralizing agents containing monovalent or polyvalent cations or mixtures thereof, by one at least of the monomers such as acrylic acid and/or methacrylic, itaconic, crotonic, fumaric acid, maleic anhydride or isocrotonic, aconitic, mesaconic, sinapic, undecylenic, angelic acid and/or the respective esters thereof, acrylamido methyl propane sulphonic acid, acrolein, acrylamide and/or methacrylamide, methacrylamido propyltrimethyl animonium chloride or sulphate, methacrylate of trimethylammonium ethyl chloride or sulphate, as well as their acrylate and acrylamide counterparts, quatemised or not, and/or dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, vinylpyrrolidone or a binding agent selected from among the linear or branched fatty acids or the linear or branched fatty alcohols or the linear or branched fatty amines, saturated or not, or selected from among the quatemary salts preferably with linear or branched fatty chains of vegetable origin or not.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">This binding agent may also be selected from among at least one of the above-mentioned monomers or mixtures thereof in the form of the monomer or monomers itself/themselves, polymerised in the presence of at least one of the mineral or organic particles.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Furthermore, it should be noted that optimisation of the molecular weight of the binding agent will depend on its chemical nature.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">For the purposes of the invention, the quantity of binding agent used in the composite compound is from 0.01% to 10%, preferably from 0.10% to 1.5% by dry weight relative to the total dry weight of the fillers or pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">The composite compounds proposed by the invention may optionally be dispersed in water, in water-solvent mixtures or in other solvents using one or more dispersing agents known to the person skilled in the art, amongst others those described in patents EP 0 100 947, EP 0 542 643 or EP 0 542 644.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">It is also important to note that the co-structured composite compounds proposed by the invention are compatible with other aqueous mineral or organic filler compounds, i.e. they form a stable and homogeneous mixture when they are simply mixed with these other suspensions, whereas it would be impossible to produce a homogeneous suspension if a co-structured composite compound as proposed by the invention were not used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">The paper coating colors and/or paper surface treatment compounds as well as wood or metal or plastic or cement surface treatment compounds and/or aqueous or non-aqueous paint compositions proposed by the invention are prepared in a manner known to the person skilled in the art by mixing in water the dry or non-aqueous or aqueous mineral or organic composite compounds of fillers or pigments proposed by the invention and one or more binders of natural or synthetic origin such as starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, the polyvinyl alcohols, for example, or latex or polymeric dispersions of the styrene-butadiene or styrene-acrylate type or acrylic or vinyl or other polymeric dispersions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">In a known manner, the paper coating colors and/or paper surface treatment compounds as well as wood or metal or plastic or cement surface treatment compounds and/or aqueous or non-aqueous paint compositions may also contain the usual additives such as rheology modifiers, organic fillers, anti-foaming agents, optical brighteners, biocide agents, lubricants, alkaline hydroxides, colourings and others.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">In addition, the aqueous suspensions containing the composite compounds, the paper coating colors and/or the paper surface-treatment compounds as well as wood or metal or plastic or cement surface treatment compounds and/or aqueous or non-aqueous paint compositions or the uncoated filling compositions proposed by the invention are characterised in that they contain dry or non-aqueous or aqueous composite compounds as proposed by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">The aqueous suspensions containing the composite compounds, the paper coating colors and/or the paper surface-treatment compounds as well as wood or metal or plastic or cement surface treatment compounds and/or aqueous paint or non-aqueous compositions as proposed by the invention are also characterised in that they are macroscopically homogeneous.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">This macroscopic homogeneity is determined by measuring the quantity of one of the fillers at the surface and the base of the flask containing the coating color diluted 40% or 20% with dry substance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">A comparison of this quantity of one of the fillers at the two &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; points of the compound proposed by the invention with the quantity of one of the fillers at these two &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; points of the standard mixture will demonstrate the fact that there is virtually no migration of one of the fillers to a preferred part of the compound of the invention, contrary to the situation that would arise with a standard mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">This macroscopic homogeneity of the composite compounds of the invention produces improved homogeneity in the sheet of paper due to a more even retention and distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">Moreover, the aqueous suspensions containing the composite compounds of the invention, the paper coating colors of the invention or the paper surface-treatment compounds of the invention are characterised in that the yield stress, as determined by a Stress Tech&#xae; machine, is higher than and preferably at least four times higher than the corresponding standard mixtures of fillers or pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">Furthermore, the aqueous suspensions of the invention or the coating colors of the invention or the paper surface-treatment compounds of the invention or the uncoated filling compounds of the invention will also exhibit an improvement in at least one of the optical properties such as opacity or whiteness or brightness or in the printability or print density properties.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Likewise, the aqueous or non-aqueous paint compositions containing the composite compounds of the invention have the advantage of an increased opacity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">Accordingly, by preference, the aqueous suspensions containing the composite compounds of the invention or the coating colors of the invention or the paper surface-treatment compounds of the invention as well as wood or metal or plastic or cement surface treatment compounds and/or aqueous or non-aqueous paint compositions are characterised in that they have a higher light scattering coefficient S than that of the corresponding standard mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">The uncoated filling compounds proposed by the invention are preferably characterised in that they exhibit a higher opacity, determined in compliance with the DIN 53416 standard, than that of the corresponding standard mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">Similarly, by preference, the aqueous suspensions containing the composite compounds of the invention or the coating colors of the invention or the paper surface-treatment compound of the invention or the uncoated filling compounds of the invention are characterised in that they have a higher whiteness, determined in compliance with the TAPPI T452 ISO 2470 standard, than that of the corresponding standard mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">By preference, the coating colors or paper surface-treatment compounds proposed by the invention are characterised in that they exhibit a higher TAPPI 75&#xb0; brightness according to Lehmann than that of a coating color containing standard suspensions of corresponding mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Finally, and by preference, the coating colors or paper surface-treatment compounds or uncoated filling compounds proposed by the invention are characterised in that the curve, plotted on the basis of the ISIT printability test, the conducting of which will be explained in example 9, representing the ink tack force as a function of time, exhibits less marked rising and falling slopes and a higher maximum value than coating colors or paper surface-treatment compounds or uncoated filling compounds containing standard suspensions of corresponding mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">Furthermore, sheets of paper which contain in the mass the composite compounds proposed by the invention are characterised in that they exhibit a higher whiteness, determined in compliance with the TAPPI T452 ISO 2470 standard, than sheets of paper containing in the mass standard suspensions of mixtures of corresponding fillers or pigments and in that they exhibit a higher opacity, measured in compliance with the DIN 53146 standard, than sheets of paper containing standard suspensions of mixtures of corresponding fillers or pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The scope and interest of the invention will be more readily understood from the, examples set out below, which are not intended to be restrictive, particularly in terms of the order in which the various constituents of the composite compounds are added.</p>

<p id="p-0242" num="0314">Table 3 demonstrates that the aqueous suspensions of the co-structured composite compound of the invention have a higher yield stress than that of the standard comparative mixtures of the prior art, characteristic of suspensions exhibiting good stability.</p>
<heading id="h-0118" level="1">EXAMPLE 9</heading>
<p id="p-0243" num="0315">This example demonstrates the quality of the printability of the different paper coating colors produced in example 7.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0316">This printability test, known as ISIT (Ink Surface Interaction Test) is based on a printing machine fitted with a device for creating and measuring the force needed to separate a contact disk from a film of printing ink. This machine consists on the one hand of the device which creates and measures the force and on the other an inking disk which rotates above the sheet of paper to be tested and is sold under the name of &#x3c;&#x3c;Ink Surface Interaction Tester&#x3e;&#x3e; by SeGan Ltd.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0317">To this end, the different sheets of paper to be tested are prepared by applying the various coating colors to be tested on these sheets of paper using the Erichsen Model 624 laboratory coater made by Erichsen GmbH &#x26; Co. KG (Germany) fitted with detachable rotating blade coaters.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0318">Once it has been coated with 7.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, the paper to be tested is fixed on a roll fitted with a two-sided adhesive tape. An offset ink is applied by placing the inking disk in contact with a width of 25 mm as it is rotated 180&#xb0;. The printing speed and pressure are adjustable and are in the order of 0.5 m/s and 50 kg respectively. The volume of ink is under standard conditions of 0.3 cm<sup>3 </sup>thus applying a thickness of approximately 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>the sheet of paper to be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0319">The printing process is followed by a series of measurements to determine the tack force repeated at pre-selected time intervals depending on the time taken to separate the tack disk (of the same dimensions as the printing disk) from the film of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0320">A coating of offset-print quality nitrile rubber is usually used for the tack disk but any equivalent material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0321">The contact force between the tack disk and the ink is measured by a system which generates an electromagnetic force. The amplitude and duration of the contact force are adjusted until a uniform adhesion is reached between the surface of the film and the tack disk at the end of 3 seconds. Rotating the sheet of paper slightly whilst the electromagnetic force is applied will ensure a close contact and continuity of the film of ink. Once the magnetic force is stopped, the tack disk is pulled back from the printed film by the force of a tensed spring, this force being sufficient to separate the disk from the film of ink. A strain gauge, mounted between the tack disk and the spring, generates a signal which is recorded as the tack force.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0322">The sequence is automatically repeated for 13 cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0323">On the first and the thirteenth cycles, the printing densities are measured using a Gretag D 186 densitometer.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0324">This operating method is used for each of the coating colors to be tested, as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0263" num="0335">The results of all the experiments are set out in Tables 4 and 5 below and graphs 1 to 5 appended to this application.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0336">Table 4 contains the results showing values of the tack force as a function of time whilst Table 5 gives the values of the printing density for tests 119 to 122.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0337"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> show the force which has to be applied to separate the disk from a film after printing as a function of time and can be interpreted taking the following three phases into account:
<ul id="ul0026" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0338">(i) the rise time,
    <ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0339">which essentially relates to the absorption and penetration speed of the ink as it makes initial contact with the surface to be printed.</li>
        <li id="ul0027-0002" num="0340">The microporosity and wettability of this surface are major factors in terms of the rise time of this force.</li>
        <li id="ul0027-0003" num="0341">The longer the rise time to the maximum value of the force, the more efficiently the binder of the ink is absorbed, the less the film of ink will be susceptible to splitting and the better the adhesion between the ink and the paper, thus producing a better result.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0342">(ii) The maximum value of the tack force,
    <ul id="ul0028" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0028-0001" num="0343">which measures on the one hand the adhesion of the layer of ink which is immobilised on contact, the printing substrate and, on the other hand, the cohesion with the ink contained on the surface of the substrate. Consequently, the higher this maximum value of tack force for a constant cohesion, the better the adhesion will be and the better the print will be.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0026-0003" num="0344">(iii) The fall time of the force,
    <ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0345">which represents the drying of the ink.</li>
        <li id="ul0029-0002" num="0346">The slower this fall time, the slower the ink will dry, the less likelihood there will be of splitting in the structure of the ink and the better the print will be.</li>

<p id="p-0274" num="0355">Each of the coating colors to be tested is then applied to this pre-weighed sheet of paper with a laboratory coater fitted with detachable rotating coating blades sold as reference model 624 by Erichsen (Germany). Each sheet of paper coated in this manner at 7.5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>is then irradiated with light of a wavelength equal to 457 nm by means of an Elrepho 2000 spectrophotometer by Datacolor (Switzerland) on a black plate to determine the reflection index R<sub>0 </sub>and on a stack of sheets of paper which have not been coated in order to determine the reflection index R<sub>1</sub>, where r is the reflection index of the stack of uncoated sheets of paper.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0388">To this end, sheets of paper are made from a cellulose pulp of SR 23 degree containing a woodless sulphate paste and fibres comprising 80% birch and 20% pine. 45 g dry weight of this pulp are then diluted in 10 litres of water in the presence of about 15 g dry weight of the filler composition to be tested to produce experimentally a filler content of 20%. After 15 minutes of agitation and adding 0.06% by dry weight, relative to the dry weight of paper, a retention agent of the polyacrylamide type, a sheet is made with a grammage equal to 75 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and filled to 20%. The device used to make the sheet is a Rapid-K&#xf6;then 20.12 MC model by Haage.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0389">The sheets prepared in this manner are dried for 400 seconds at 92&#xb0; C. and in a vacuum of 940 mbar. The filler content is controlled by analysing the ashes.</p>
