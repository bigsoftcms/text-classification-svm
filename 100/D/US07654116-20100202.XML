<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to an article of clothing. Specifically, it pertains to a scarf or scarf-like article of clothing designed to take and hold certain defined shapes when worn around the neck of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Scarves are an important accessory to any wardrobe because they offer warmth, versatility, and a way to accent or complete a wardrobe. Scarves are typically flat, rectangular, straight edged, and are made from a uniformly woven or knitted cloth material. Frequently, these straight edge scarves are woven to be precisely straight, to have even knitting, and to have an even knit tension differential. Because of this even knit tension differential, most scarves are limp and fail to hold the shape that the wearer places the scar in around the neck. As such, the wearer is forced to continually adjust the scarf so that it once again takes the shape desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although there are mechanisms external to the stitch types or knit types of the scarf, such as plastic inserts or elastic bands, which can be used to create a scarf that holds its shape, there is no scarf available that holds its shape solely from knit tension. A scarf with knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of a scarf produces the effect of a scarf that takes and holds certain desired shapes when it is worn by a user. To date, no such scarf has been commercially available on the market.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical scarf is disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 1,666,819, issued to Goetze. Goetze discloses a scarf that is rectangular, flat, and has two types of knit stitching, a tight stitch on the outer edges and a loose stitch on the inside. However, the knit stitching of the scarves of Goetze does not create a knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of the scarf, and it does not produce the effect of a scarf that takes and holds a desired specific shape when it is worn by a user. Indeed, the dual knit stitching of the Goetze scarf is wholly for an ornamentally visual effect and serves no actual structural utilitarian purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are scarves commercially available, such as curly whirlies, that are stitched or knitted so that the scarf takes on a circular shape. However, a curly whirly is specifically knitted to have a circular-corkscrew shape, and the curvature of a curly whirly is usually so extreme that it gives the scarf a wavy or warped look. Additionally, the curly whirly does not have a knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of the scarf, and it does not produce the effect of a scarf that holds a shape when worn by a user. Indeed, a curly whirly is designed to be floppy and wavy, rather than architecturally structured and shape retaining.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there remains a long felt need in the art for a scarf with knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of the scarf that produces the effect of a scarf that takes and holds certain specific desired shapes when it is worn by a user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To minimize the limitations in the prior art, and to minimize other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a scarf with a knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of the scarf that produces the effect of a scarf that takes and holds a specific desired shape when it is worn by a user. The scarf of the present invention preferably has a three dimensional, hyperbolic shape that takes and holds a specific architectural shape when wrapped in different ways around the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of this invention is a scarf, comprising: a hyperbolic scarf body. The hyperbolic scarf body has an inner edge and an outer edge. The inner edge and the outer edge are on opposing sides along a length of the hyperbolic scarf body. The inner edge is knitted from a narrow stitch and said outer edge is knitted from a wide stitch, and the narrow stitch and the wide stitch create a differential in a knit tension between the inner edge and the outer edge along the length of the hyperbolic scarf body. The inner edge and the outer edge meet at a transition, wherein the transition runs along the length of the hyperbolic scarf body. The differential in the knit tension causes said scarf to have a natural hyperbolic curve with the inner edge smaller than and concentrically disposed within the outer edge. The differential in the knit tension causes the scarf to take and maintain a specific structural shape when draped around a neck of a user. The hyperbolic scarf body forms a shape of a letter C when laid out flat on a surface. The hyperbolic scarf has a middle section and two end sections. The middle section is a different color or pattern than the two end sections, and the two end sections are the same color or pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the invention is a method of tying a scarf comprising the following steps: 1) providing a hyperbolic scarf body with an inner edge and an outer edge, wherein the inner edge and the outer edge are on opposing sides along a length of the hyperbolic scarf body, wherein the inner edge and the outer edge meet at a transition, wherein the transition runs along the length of the hyperbolic scarf body, wherein the inner edge and the outer edge have different stitching that creates a differential in a knit tension between the inner edge and the outer edge along the length of the hyperbolic scarf body, wherein the differential in the knit tension causes the scarf to have a natural hyperbolic curve with the inner edge smaller than and concentrically disposed within the outer edge, and wherein the differential in the knit tension causes the scarf to maintain a structural shape when draped or wrapped around the neck of wearer; 2) providing a hyperbolic scarf body with a middle section and two end sections; and 3) draping the scarf around the neck of the wearer, wherein the middle section frames a back of the neck and the two end sections rest on a plurality of shoulders of the wearer and hang in a front of a torso of the wearer, wherein the inner edge of the middle section is below the outer edge of the middle section, wherein the inner edge of the two end sections hang distally from the front of the torso of the wearer, wherein the outer edge of the two end sections are proximal to the inner edge of the two end sections, and wherein the middle section and the two end sections remain in place and maintain the structural position chosen by the wearer. The method further comprises the steps of: crossing the two end sections such that one of the two end sections is in a front of the other of the two end sections; wrapping one of the two end sections around an opposite side of the neck of the wearer, such that the wrapped end section hangs down a back of the wearer; and wrapping a second of the two end sections around the opposite side of the neck of the wearer, such that both the wrapped end sections hang down a back of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a scarf that will overcome the deficiencies of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide a scarf frames the face and holds an interesting sculptural shape and one of several desired architectural structures, shapes, and positions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide a scarf with a unique and subtly appealing design that frames face, highlighting the neck, jaw, collarbones and base of the throat.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive, fashionable, well made, long lasting, and durable scarf.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of this invention is to provide a scarf that can be wrapped around the neck of a user in many different ways to form new and interesting structural looks. The scarf is adjustable and customizable in numerous ways.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of this invention is to provide a scarf that has a natural hyperbolic or hyperboloid curve when laid out on a flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other features and advantages are inherent in the scarf claimed and disclosed will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and its accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following detailed description of various embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various aspects of one or more embodiments of the invention. However, one or more embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and/or components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a top plan view of one embodiment of the scarf. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> preferably has a middle section <b>12</b>, two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, an inner edge <b>20</b>, an outer edge <b>30</b>, and a transition <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows how scarf <b>10</b> has a hyperbolic curve. This curve is a natural result of a knit tension differential that is caused by the inner edge <b>20</b> and the outer edge <b>30</b> having two different types of knit stitches. Preferably inner edge <b>20</b> is made with a narrow stitch, such as a regular 1&#xd7;1 rib knit stitch and outer edge <b>30</b> is made with a wide stitch, such as a Fisherman's/English/Shaker rib knit stitch. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, these different stitches preferably transition along the entire length of scarf <b>10</b>. This transition is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as transition <b>40</b>. Scarf <b>10</b> may be made with any stitching, as long as a stitching creates a knit tension and this knit tension causes the scarf to hold a structural shape when draped or wrapped around the user. A wide stitch, such as a Fisherman's/English/Shaker rib knit stitch is bulkier and more voluminous than a narrow stitch and uses more yarn per stitch. A narrow stitch is tighter and denser than a wide stitch.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably scarf <b>10</b> is knitted, stitched, or crocheted, and scarf <b>10</b> may be made by hand or machine. Preferably, scarf <b>10</b> is made from animal fibers, such as silk, or the hair from animals such as, sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, camel, yak, and musk-ox (qiviut). However, scarf <b>10</b> may be made from any material that can be knitted, including, but not limited to: ribbons; metal wire; exotic filaments; fiberglass; plant based yarn fibers, made from such plants as cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana trees, soy and corn; intermediate fibers such as rayon and acetate fibers, which are produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees; and synthetic fibers, such as, acrylics, polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate, synthetic biopolymers, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when scarf <b>10</b> is laid out flat, on a flat surface, the natural curvature of the scarf roughly forms the shape of the letter &#x201c;C&#x201d;. This shape is preferred because it allows a high degree of versatility in wrapping the scarf around a user in a manner that the scarf will take and hold a specific desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of a side plan view of one embodiment of the scarf. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> has, two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, middle section <b>12</b>, inner edge <b>20</b>, outer edge <b>30</b>, transition <b>40</b>, side of outer edge <b>50</b>, and side of inner edge <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows how the knit stitching of scarf <b>10</b> creates a visible thickness and gives scarf <b>10</b> a three dimensional structure. The combination of the three dimensional structure and the hyperbolic shape allow scarf <b>10</b> to hold a shape when wrapped, in different ways, around a wearer. In this way scarf <b>10</b> is adjustable and customizable in numerous ways.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of a method by which one embodiment of the scarf may be placed or tied around the wearer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> is draped around a wearer in an open manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows scarf <b>10</b> with the middle section <b>12</b> around the neck of the wearer and the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in front of the wearer. The outer edge <b>30</b> is on top around the neck, and on the inside at the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The inner edge <b>20</b> is the on bottom around the neck, and on the outside at the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of a method by which one embodiment of the scarf may be placed or tied around the wearer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> is draped around a wearer in a crossed manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows scarf <b>10</b> with the middle section <b>12</b> around the neck of the wearer and the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in front of the wearer. The outer edge <b>30</b> is on top around the neck, but because of the crossing of the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in the front of the wearer, outer edge <b>30</b> is also on the outside at the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The inner edge <b>20</b> is the on bottom around the neck and on the inside at the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. Because of the natural hyperbolic shape of scarf <b>10</b>, even though the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are crossed, at the very tips of the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> the scarf re-crosses so that scarf <b>10</b> has a unique zig-zag appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration of a method by which one embodiment of the scarf may be placed or tied around the wearer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> is draped around a wearer in a one end tossed over the shoulder manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows scarf <b>10</b> with the middle section <b>12</b> around the neck of the wearer and end section <b>14</b> in front of the wearer. End section <b>16</b> is wrapped around the front of the neck of the wear and tossed over the shoulder so that end section <b>16</b> hangs down the back of the wearer. The outer edge <b>30</b> is on top around the neck, on the outside in front of the wearer, and on the inside in back of the wearer. The inner edge <b>20</b> is the on bottom around the neck, on the inside (at end section <b>14</b>) in front of the wearer, and on the outside (at end section <b>16</b>) in back of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of a method by which one embodiment of the scarf may be placed or tied around the wearer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, scarf <b>10</b> is draped around a wearer in a toss two manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows scarf <b>10</b> with the middle section <b>12</b> around the neck of the wearer and the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in back of the wearer. The outer edge <b>30</b> is on top around the neck, and because of the crossing of the two end sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> as they wrap around the front of the neck of the wearer, outer edge <b>30</b> is on the inside at end section <b>16</b> and on the outside at end section <b>14</b>, relative to the back of the wearer. Outer edge <b>30</b> is on the outside at end section <b>14</b> because end section <b>14</b> is folded at fold <b>80</b> so that it fits in a snug manner around and over end section <b>16</b> before it is draped over the back of the wearer. If end section <b>14</b> is not folded, and is instead merely wrapped around the front of the neck of the wearer, outer edge <b>30</b> will be on the inside as end section <b>14</b> hangs down the back of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> demonstrate, there are numerous methods that can be used to wear scarf <b>10</b> so that the scarf takes and holds an interesting and stylish architectural structure around the neck of the wearer. These numerous methods include, but are not limited to: multiple crossings of the two end sections; tying the end sections in simple knots; draping the middle section around the shoulders of the wearer, the head of the wearer, or the side of the neck of the wearer; and wrapping the scarf around the back or front of the shoulders of the wearer, rather than around the neck of the wearer. Importantly, regardless of how scarf <b>10</b> is worn by the wearer, scarf <b>10</b> takes and continues to hold the specific architectural shape designated by the wearer and consistently frames the neck, jaw, face, or other body part of the wearer in an interesting, stylish, and pleasing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In summary, the present invention is a scarf with a knit tension differential between opposing sides along the length of the scarf that produces the effect of a scarf that takes and holds a specific architectural shape when it is worn by a user. The scarf of the present invention preferably has a three dimensional, hyperbolic shape that holds a form when wrapped in different ways around the wearer.</p>
