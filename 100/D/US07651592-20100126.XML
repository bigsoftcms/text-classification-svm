<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 of PCT/JP2006/309822 filed on 17 May 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a molded article made mainly of inorganic powder and a method of producing the same. In particular, it relates to a molded article suited for use as a mold for producing a casting or a structure (hereinafter inclusively referred to as a casting mold, etc.) and a method of producing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general production of castings, a casting mold with a cavity is created out of casting sand from a pattern made of wood, metal, etc., molten metal is poured in the cavity, and, after cooling, a cast product is taken out of the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Making a wooden or metal pattern requires skill and expensive equipment. Such a pattern is expensive and heavy and, moreover, gives rise to a disposal problem and is therefore unsuited to the production of castings except mass-produced items. Because a mold of sand is prepared by hardening casting sand that is a mixture of common sand and a binder, sand reclamation is needed in reusing the sand. Sand reclamation is accompanied by generation of waste such as dust.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address these problems, Applicant made a proposal in JP-A-2004-181472, in which a casting mold, etc. are formed of molded articles containing organic fiber, inorganic fiber, and a thermosetting resin. The molded article by the proposed technique is thinner, lighter, and more processable than conventional sand molds and involves no problem of waste generation. Depending on the design, some castings have complicated shapes and are required to achieve precision in detail. There has still been a demand for a molded article that can be applied to the manufacture of such castings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the light of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a molded article with which a casting material is shaped into a complicated configuration with precision in detail and a method of producing the molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention accomplishes the above object by the provision of a molded article containing inorganic powder as a main component and further contains inorganic fiber, organic fiber, a thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles. The molded article contains the heat exparidable particles in an amount of 0.5% to 10% by mass based on the total mass of the inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention also provides a method of producing the molded article of the invention, including the steps of preparing a stock slurry by dispersing the inorganic powder, the inorganic fiber, the organic fiber, the thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles in a dispersing medium, forming a wet preform from the slurry by a papermaking process, and drying the preform by heating in a mold to shape the preform while expanding the heat expandable particles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a molded article with detailed precision however complicated the shape may be and a method of producing the molded article.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention will be described based on its preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention is basically described with respect to an embodiment in which the molded article of the invention is applied to a casting mold, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The molded article of the present embodiment contains inorganic powder as a main component and further contains inorganic fiber, organic fiber, a thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles. The phrase &#x201c;as a main component&#x201d; means that the inorganic powder forms a largest proportion by mass in the molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The molded article of the present embodiment preferably contains 0.5% to 10%, more preferably 2% to 8%, (by mass) of the heat expandable particles based on the total mass of the inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles. The content of the heat expandable particles being in that range, a sufficient effect of addition is produced while minimizing adverse influences of expansion on molding precision. As a result, the inner configuration of a papermaking mold is faithfully transferred to a molded article in detail. Even when the papermaking mold is complicatedly shaped, papermaking (formation of a preform) can be achieved with good precision in every detail without causing cracks or tears. This is because heat expandable particles expand to press the papermaking material onto every corner of the papermaking mold. Due to the limited amount of the heat expandable particles, over-expansion is prevented, no extra cooling time is needed, and thus high productivity is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The molded article of the invention contains heat expandable particles in their heat expanded state. The average diameter of the particles before heat expansion is preferably 5 to 80 mm, more preferably 20 to 50 mm. The average diameter of the expandable particles falling within that range, a sufficient effect of addition is secured while minimizing adverse influences of expansion on molding precision.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the molded article of the invention, the compounding ratio (by mass) of inorganic powder/inorganic fiber/organic fiber/thermosetting resin/heat expandable particles is preferably 70 to 80/2 to 6/2 to 10/8 to 16/0.5 to 10, more preferably 70 to 80/2 to 8/2 to 6/10 to 14/2 to 8, taking the total of the inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles as 100 by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The recited proportion of the inorganic powder provides satisfactory shape retention during a pour, satisfactory surface properties of a molded article, and easy release of a molded article from a mold after shaping. The expanding force of the heat expandable particles and the adjusted binding force, in synergistic cooperation with each other, facilitate movement of the components such as the inorganic and organic fibers. As a result, the configuration of a shaping mold is transferred to a molded article more faithfully.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The recited proportion of the inorganic fiber provides satisfactory moldability and shape retention during a pour. The recited proportion of the organic fiber provides satisfactory moldability while minimizing gas generation and belch of flame from a flow-off during a pour. The recited proportion of the thermosetting resin provides satisfactory moldability, shape retention during a pour, and surface smoothness.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inorganic powder includes graphite, such as tabular graphite (scaly graphite) or earthy graphite, obsidian, mica, mullite, silica, and magnesia. One or more than one kind of these inorganic powders can be selected for use. Graphite, particularly tabular graphite (scaly graphite), is preferred in view of moldability and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The inorganic fiber serves mainly to constitute the skeleton of the molded article. On pouring molten metal, it does not bum with the heat of the molten metal and continues serving to retain the shape of the molded article. The inorganic fiber includes carbon fiber, artificial mineral fibers such as rock wool, ceramic fibers, and natural mineral fibers. They can be used either alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Carbon fiber that maintains high strength even in high temperatures, such as pitch-based carbon fiber or polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber, is preferred for reducing thermal shrinkage accompanying carbonization of the thermosetting resin. PAN-based carbon fiber is especially preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inorganic fiber preferably has an average length of 0.5 to 15 mm, more preferably 1 to 8 mm, from the standpoint of good drainage in dewatering a preform (a precursor of a casting mold, etc.) formed by a papermaking process, moldability to obtain a casting mold, etc., and uniformity of the resulting casting mold, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The organic fiber includes paper fibers (pulp fibers), fibrillated synthetic fibers, and regenerated fibers (e.g., rayon fiber). These fibers are used either individually or as a mixture of two or more thereof. Preferred of them are paper fibers from the viewpoint of molding properties, strength after drying, and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The paper fibers include not only wood pulp but non-wood pulp, such as cotton pulp, linter pulp, bamboo, and straw. These kinds of pulp, whether virgin or recycled, can be used either alone or in combination thereof. From the standpoint of ease and stability of supply, environmental conservation, and reduction of production cost, used paper pulp is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is preferred for the organic fiber to have an average length of 0.8 to 2.0 mm, more preferably 0.9 to 1.8 mm, from the viewpoint of molding properties, surface smoothness, and impact strength of the resulting molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The thermosetting resin is a component necessary to retain the low- and high-temperature strength of a molded article and to provide a molded article with good surface properties, which contribute to improve the surface smoothness of a casting when the molded article is used as a casting mold. The thermosetting resins include phenol resins, epoxy resins, and furan resins. Phenol resins are preferred of them in view of reduced generation of combustible gas, which is effective to suppress burning. Moreover, because a phenol resin has a high carbon residue content after thermal decomposition (carbonization) as high as 25% or more, when a molded article containing a phenol resin is used as a casting mold, it forms a carbonized film to provide a casting with an improved casting surface. Usable phenol resins include novolak phenol resins requiring a curing agent and resol type phenol resins requiring no curing agent. In using a novolak phenol resin, a curing agent is required. Since the curing agent easily dissolves in water, it is preferably applied to the surface of a molded article after dewatering. The curing agent preferably includes hexamethylenetetramine. The thermosetting resins can be used either individually or as a combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The heat expandable particles preferably include microcapsules having a blowing agent that vaporizes and expands encapsulated in a thermoplastic resin capsule wall. It is preferred that the microcapsules have an average particle size of 5 to 80 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 20 to 50 &#x3bc;m, and, on being heated to 80&#xb0; to 200&#xb0; C., expand to increase preferably to 3 to 5 times in diameter and 50 to 100 times in volume.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The thermoplastic resin constituting the capsule wall of the microcapsules includes polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrylonitrile-vinylidene chloride copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, and mixtures thereof. The blowing agent to be encapsulated includes low-boiling organic solvents, such as propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, and petroleum ether.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to the aforementioned components, the molded article of the present embodiment can contain other components in appropriate ratios. The other components include strengthening agents, such as polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and a polyamideamine-epichlorohydrin resin, flocculants, and colorants.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the molded article according to the present embodiment is prepared using a slurry containing water, the water content of the molded article before use (i.e., before use as a casting mold) is preferably 8% or less, more preferably 3% or less. A smaller water content causes less gas generation attributed to thermal decomposition (carbonization) of the thermosetting resin on pouring molten metal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The molded article of the present embodiment may have an appropriate thickness according to the use. A preferred thickness is 0.2 to 5 mm. A more preferred thickness is 0.7 to 1.5 mm. Within the above preferred thickness range, the strength is secured sufficiently while minimizing the influences of the expansion of the heat expandable particles on the molding properties, and gas generation on pouring is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method of producing a molded article according to the present invention will then be described with particular reference to the production of the molded article according to the above-described embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the drying/shaping means <b>4</b> has a female mold <b>40</b> and a male mold <b>41</b>.

The female mold <b>40</b> has a concave forming part <b>400</b> defining the exterior contour of the molded article <b>11</b> to be produced. The female mold <b>40</b> is equipped with a heater (heating means) <b>401</b> for heating the forming part <b>400</b>. The female mold <b>40</b> is vertically movable by a vertical moving means <b>402</b>. The female mold <b>40</b> has gas/liquid passageways (not shown) open on the surface of the forming part <b>400</b> and piercing the inside thereof.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The apparatus <b>1</b> has a transfer means (not shown) that moves the papermaking mold <b>30</b> and the male mold <b>41</b> along a guide <b>50</b> to the respective predetermined positions. The apparatus <b>1</b> also has a control means (not shown) having a sequencer connected to each of the above-mentioned means whereby to operate the means in accordance with the sequence described hereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method of producing a molded article by use of the apparatus <b>1</b> will then be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 10(</figref><i>b</i>). In these figures numeral <b>10</b> indicates a preform, and numeral <b>11</b> indicates a molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The method of producing a molded article according to the aforementioned embodiment begins with the preparation of a stock slurry by dispersing the above-described inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles in a dispersing medium. The slurry should be formulated as appropriate for a molded article to be produced, such as the one described above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dispersing medium includes water, white water, a solvent such as ethanol or methanol, and mixtures thereof. Water is preferred in view of stability in papermaking, dewatering, and shaping, stability of the molded article quality, cost, ease of handling, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A wet preform 10 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is formed from the prepared slurry by papermaking processing. In the step of papermaking, the vertically moving mechanism <b>21</b> operates to lower the pouring frame <b>20</b>, and the valve <b>23</b> opens to supply the slurry through the slurry feed pipe <b>22</b> into the pouring frame <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the slurry in the pouring frame <b>20</b> reaches a prescribed amount, the valve <b>23</b> closes to stop the slurry feed. The valve <b>304</b> opens, and the liquid matter of the slurry is sucked by the suction pump <b>302</b> through the gas/liquid passageways <b>301</b> and the drainage pipe <b>303</b>. Meanwhile the solid matter of the slurry is deposited on the surface of the wire <b>305</b> to build up a wet preform <b>10</b>. The liquid content of the preform <b>10</b> is preferably 50 to 300 parts by mass, more preferably 70 to 200 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the solids content of the preform <b>10</b> taking into consideration ease of handling the preform <b>10</b> and deformability of the preform <b>10</b> due to flow of the fibers while pressed between the female mold <b>40</b> and the male mold <b>41</b> (deformation to some extent by the pressing is desirable). The liquid content can be adjusted by the suction of the liquid matter with the suction pump <b>302</b>. When the liquid content decreases to a predetermined level, the suction is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After completion of the formation of the preform <b>10</b>, the vertically moving mechanism <b>21</b> lifts the pouring frame <b>20</b>, and the transfer means operates to transfer the papermaking mold <b>30</b> to under the female mold <b>40</b> along the guide <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this way, the preform <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is obtained, which has an opening, a flange <b>101</b> around the perimeter of the opening, and a cavity wall <b>102</b>, the flange <b>101</b> and the cavity wall <b>102</b> meeting to form an edge <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The female mold <b>40</b> is then lowered and joined with the papermaking mold <b>30</b> by the vertically moving mechanism <b>402</b>. The preform <b>10</b> is sucked toward the forming part <b>400</b> through the flow pipe <b>403</b> of the female mold <b>40</b>. The female mold <b>40</b> is moved up by the vertically moving mechanism <b>402</b> whereby the preform <b>10</b> is transferred from the papermaking mold to the female mold <b>40</b>. The female mold <b>40</b> is then moved to the position for drying and shaping with the male mold <b>41</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the preform is heated in a shaping mold and thereby dried and shaped while expanding the heat expandable particles. In this drying step, the vertically moving mechanism <b>402</b> operates to lower the female mold <b>40</b> (a half of the shaping mold) to mate the female mold <b>40</b> with the male mold <b>41</b> (the other half of the shaping mold) heated to a prescribed temperature. The preform <b>10</b> is pressed between the male and female molds, and the heat expandable particles expand with the progress of drying/shaping to give a heat-dried molded article <b>11</b>. The expansion of the heat expandable particles with the progress of drying/shaping brings about improved precision of shape transfer to a molded article. As a result, the edge <b>113</b> of the molded article <b>11</b> where the flange <b>111</b> and the cavity wall <b>112</b> meet becomes sharp as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Additionally, the resulting molded article <b>11</b> has excellent surface smoothness even on its vertical regions (e.g., <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>)) that are difficult to exert a sufficient pressing force by merely butting the female mold (a half of the shaping mol) <b>40</b> and the male mold (the other half of the shaping mold) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The mold temperature (the temperature of the female mold <b>40</b> and the male mold <b>41</b>) is decided as appropriate to the molded article to be produced. To avoid scorching of the preform <b>10</b>, the mold temperature is preferably 100&#xb0; to 250&#xb0; C., more preferably 120&#xb0; to 200&#xb0; C. The pressing pressure by the female mold <b>40</b> and the male mold <b>41</b> is preferably 0.2 to 10 MPa, more preferably 0.5 to 5 MPa, taking it into consideration that any thick-walled part should be leveled and the like. Note that the pressing pressure can largely deviate from the above range depending on the material making the molded article, the strength, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During the drying and shaping, the valve <b>414</b> is open, and the water content of the preform <b>10</b> is sucked by the suction pump <b>412</b> through the gas/liquid passageways <b>411</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the drainage pipe <b>413</b> and discharged outside. On the other hand, the vertically moving mechanism <b>21</b> operates to lower the pouring frame <b>20</b> to have the wire part <b>301</b> of the papermaking mold <b>30</b> enclosed in the pouring frame <b>20</b>, and another preform is formed in the same manner as in the above-described papermaking step.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On completion of the drying/shaping step, the suction through the flow pipe <b>403</b> is switched to blowing air from the compressor, and the vertically moving mechanism <b>402</b> lifts the female mold <b>40</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The suction by the suction pump <b>412</b> is stopped, and the molded article <b>11</b> left on the male mold <b>41</b> is removed. A cycle of production of the molded article <b>11</b> thus completes. Meanwhile the pouring frame <b>20</b> is moved up by the vertically moving mechanism <b>21</b>, and the next preform <b>10</b> is then transferred to the step of heating. In the method of the present embodiment, the above-described steps of papermaking and drying/shaping are repeatedly carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When two of the thus produced molded articles <b>11</b> are mated with their flanges <b>111</b> butted together as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), substantially no gap is formed along the parting line where the edges of the two molded articles meet as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>) because of their sharp-cut edges <b>113</b>. Therefore, where the two molded articles are joined to make, for example, a casting mold having a cavity, in which molten metal is poured, a flashless casting can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The resulting molded article may be partially or entirely impregnated with the above-described thermosetting resin according to necessity. After the impregnation, the impregnated molded article is dried by heating to thermally cure the thermosetting resin, if necessary, followed by trimming, cutting or like machining to make a final molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The molded article thus obtained contains the inorganic powder as a main component and further contains the inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles. Since the heat expandable particles in the preform s expand to fill voids in every corner of the preform in the drying/shaping step, the molded article shows high molding precision in detail even if the shape is complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to the molding properties described above, the molded article has excellent surface smoothness, which can be maintained during a pour. Therefore, the molded article, when used as a casting mold, provides a casting with improved surface smoothness. In particular, burn-on after pouring is greatly reduced without the aid of a parting agent as has been applied to conventional casting molds, so that casting can be achieved through a reduced number of processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The molded article being excellent in high-temperature strength and shape retention during a pour, use of the molded article in casting eliminates the necessity to harden casting sand with a binder in making a casting mold. It follows that the spent sand needs no mechanical polishing for reclamation, which greatly reduces the waste from casting. When the molded article is used as a core to make a hollow part of a casting, the core does not always need to be filled with sand.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, the molded article after casting can easily be removed so that the casting mold, etc. are easier to remove than before. The molded article, being light-weight, is easy to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the method of the present embodiment, since the molded article is produced by a papermaking technique using a stock slurry containing the above-described components, a casting mold, etc. having the components uniformly dispersed therein can be obtained. Therefore, the casting mold has reduced occurrence of troubles such as cracking with thermal shrinkage, exhibits excellent high-temperature strength, surface smoothness, molding precision, and mechanical strength, and provides a casting having high surface smoothness with good casting precision.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While the organic fiber burns by the heat of molten metal to form voids inside the casting mold, the strength of the mold is maintained by the inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles. After the casting mold is broken, the molded article is easily be separated and removed from sand by blasting or the like. In other words, the molded article according to the present invention, which contains the inorganic powder, inorganic fiber, organic fiber, thermosetting resin, and heat expandable particles, retains its strength when it is assembled into a casting mold and during a pour and has reduced strength after the casting mold is broken. In making a casting by use of the molded article of the invention, the waste is easier and therefore less costly to dispose of, and the amount of the waste itself is reduced than in a conventional system.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The molded article of the invention is light-weight and easy to cut with a simple tool and therefore easy to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The present invention is not construed as being limited to the aforementioned embodiments but is subject to variation as appropriate without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The molded article of the invention is suitable for use as not only a casting mold part (i.e., a main mold and a core) but also structures, such as a runner, a wall, a pouring cup, a sprue, a choke, a gate, a vent, a flow-off, and a feeder, and other auxiliary structures used in casting. The molded article of the invention is also applicable to other fields demanding heat resistance in addition to the field of casting, enjoying high molding precision in every corner of its shape as designed for the application.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0093">The curvature radius (R) at the edges of the molded article was in a range of about 0.1 to 0.2 mm, indicating that the molded article had sharp edges. Two of the molded articles were mated to form a cavity and buried in sand. Molten metal was poured into the cavity to achieve casting. As shown in Table 1, the casting obtained by using the molded articles of Example 1 displayed satisfactory results in shape transfer, reduction of flash, and reduction of metal penetration. The casting was particularly excellent in that the flash along the whole parting line was 1 mm or shorter.</p>

The vertical regions <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> of the molded articles <b>11</b> were found to have surface roughness due to pressure shortage and, in parts, suffered from a crack or a hole.

Flash exceeding 1 mm occurred at many sites along the parting line. The surface roughness of the vertical regions of the molded articles had been transferred to the casting, and molten metal penetration had occurred at the sites corresponding to the crack or hole.
