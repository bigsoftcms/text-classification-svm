<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/530,534 filed Dec. 18, 2003.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to rotary spinning processes for forming hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers, more particularly to processes for making hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers using a rotary spinning die, hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers made by such rotary spinning processes and webs made with such hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Non-rotary spinning processes for making fibers such as those using knife-edge dies and/or spunbond dies and/or melt blown dies are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rotary spinning processes for making fibers that do not contain hydroxyl polymers are also known in the art. For example it is known that fiberglass material fibers can be formed by rotary spinning processes. However, the prior art fails to teach or suggest rotary spinning processes for making hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers, especially hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers that exhibit wet strength properties and/or solubility properties that are suitable for consumer products.</p>

The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition is formed into a hydroxyl polymer-containing fiber as a result of attenuation of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition via an attenuating fluid stream and/or gravitational forces and/or mechanical forces and/or electrical forces as the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition exits the non-rotary spinning die. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic representation of a non-rotary spinning process for making hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a non-rotary spinning die <b>10</b> comprises an attenuating fluid stream opening <b>12</b> through which an attenuating fluid stream <b>14</b> exits the die <b>10</b> and a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition opening <b>16</b> through which a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>18</b> exits the die <b>10</b> and is attenuated into the form of a hydroxyl polymer-containing fiber <b>20</b> solely as a result of the attenuating fluid stream <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">&#x201c;Rotary spinning process&#x201d; as used herein means a process wherein a non hydroxyl polymer-containing fiber is formed from a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition as the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition exits a rotary spinning die. The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition is formed into a hydroxyl polymer-containing fiber as a result of attenuation of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition by an attenuation force other than solely an attenuating fluid stream and/or gravitational forces and/or mechanical forces and/or electrical forces as the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition exits the rotary spinning die. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are schematic representations of one example of a rotary spinning process for making hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">&#x201c;Attenuating fluid stream&#x201d; as used herein means a discrete fluid stream that imparts acceleration to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition preferably such that the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition is drawn into a hydroxyl polymer-containing fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">&#x201c;Discrete fluid stream&#x201d; as used herein means one or more gases, such as air, that exhibits sufficient velocity and proximity to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition such that the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition is accelerated by the one or more gases.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">&#x201c;Fiber&#x201d; or &#x201c;filament&#x201d; as used herein means a slender, thin, and highly flexible object having a major axis which is very long, compared to the fiber's two mutually-orthogonal axes that are perpendicular to the major axis. Preferably, an aspect ratio of the major's axis length to an equivalent diameter of the fiber's cross-section perpendicular to the major axis is greater than 100/1, more specifically greater than 500/1, and still more specifically greater than 1000/1, and even more specifically, greater than 5000/1. The fibers may be continuous or substantially continuous fibers or they may be discontinuous fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">The fibers of the present invention may have a fiber diameter of less than about 50 microns and/or less than about 20 microns and/or less than about 10 microns and/or less than about 8 microns and/or less than about 6 microns and/or less than about 4 microns as measured by the Fiber Diameter Test Method described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">&#x201c;Spinning process temperature&#x201d; as used herein means the temperature at which the hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers are attenuated at the external surface of the rotary spinning die as the hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">&#x201c;Hydroxyl polymer-containing composition&#x201d; as used herein means a composition that comprises at least one hydroxyl polymer. In one example, the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition comprises at least one material that doesn't melt before it decomposes. For example, a hydroxyl polymer can dissolve in water, rather than melt, and then can be dried (removal of water) during a fiber forming process.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Hydroxyl Polymer-Containing Composition</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition comprises a hydroxyl polymer. &#x201c;Hydroxyl polymer&#x201d; as used herein mean any polymer that contains greater than 10% and/or greater than 20% and/or greater than 25% by weight hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may be a composite containing a blend of polymers, wherein at least one is a hydroxyl polymer, and/or fillers both inorganic and organic, and/or fibers and/or foaming agents.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may already be formed. In one example, the hydroxyl polymer may be solubilized via contact with a liquid, such as water, in order to form the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition. Such a liquid may be considered for the purposes of the present invention as performing the function of an external plasticizer. Alternatively, any other suitable processes known to those skilled in the art to produce the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition such that the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition exhibits suitable properties for spinning the composition into a fiber may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may have and/or be exposed to a temperature of from about 23&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. and/or from about 65&#xb0; C. to about 95&#xb0; C. and/or from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C. when making fibers from the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">The pH of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may be from about 2.5 to about 9 and/or from about 3 to about 8.5 and/or from about 3.2 to about 8 and/or from about 3.2 to about 7.5.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may have a shear viscosity, as measured according to the Shear Viscosity of a Hydroxyl Polymer-Containing Composition Test Method described herein, of less than about 300 Pa&#xb7;s and/or from about 0.1 Pa&#xb7;s to about 300 Pa&#xb7;s and/or from about 1 Pa&#xb7;s to about 250 Pa&#xb7;s and/or from about 3 Pa&#xb7;s to about 200 Pa&#xb7;s as measured at a shear rate of 3,000 sec<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at the spinning process temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">In one example, a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of the present invention may comprise at least about 5% and/or 15% and/or from at least about 20% and/or 30% and/or 40% and/or 45% and/or 50% to about 75% and/or 80% and/or 85% and/or 90% and/or 95% and/or 99.5% by weight of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of a hydroxyl polymer. The hydroxyl polymer may have a weight average molecular weight greater than about 100,000 g/mol prior to crosslinking.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">A crosslinking system may be present in the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition and/or may be added to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition before polymer processing of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">The hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may comprise a) at least about 5% and/or 15% and/or from at least about 20% and/or 30% and/or 40% and/or 45% and/or 50% to about 75% and/or 80% and/or 85% by weight of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of a hydroxyl polymer; b) a crosslinking system comprising from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of a crosslinking agent; and c) from about 10% and/or 15% and/or 20% to about 50% and/or 55% and/or 60% and/or 70% by weight of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of external plasticizer e.g., water.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Synthesis of Hydroxyl Polymer-Containing Composition</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">A hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of the present invention may be prepared using a screw extruder, such as a vented twin screw extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">A barrel <b>60</b> of an APV Baker (Peterborough, England) twin screw extruder is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The barrel <b>60</b> is separated into eight zones, identified as zones <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>. The barrel <b>60</b> encloses the extrusion screw and mixing elements, schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and serves as a containment vessel during the extrusion process. A solid feed port <b>62</b> is disposed in zone <b>1</b> and a liquid feed port <b>64</b> is disposed in zone <b>1</b>. A vent <b>66</b> is included in zone <b>7</b> for cooling and decreasing the liquid, such as water, content of the mixture prior to exiting the extruder. An optional vent stuffer, commercially available from APV Baker, can be employed to prevent the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition from exiting through the vent <b>66</b>. The flow of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition through the barrel <b>60</b> is from zone <b>1</b> exiting the barrel <b>60</b> at zone <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">A screw and mixing element configuration for the twin screw extruder is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The twin screw extruder comprises a plurality of twin lead screws (TLS) (designated A and B) and single lead screws (SLS) (designated C and D) installed in series. Screw elements (A-D) are characterized by the number of continuous leads and the pitch of these leads.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">A lead is a flight (at a given helix angle) that wraps the core of the screw element. The number of leads indicates the number of flights wrapping the core at any given location along the length of the screw. Increasing the number of leads reduces the volumetric capacity of the screw and increases the pressure generating capability of the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The pitch of the screw is the distance needed for a flight to complete one revolution of the core. It is expressed as the number of screw element diameters per one complete revolution of a flight. Decreasing the pitch of the screw increases the pressure generated by the screw and decreases the volumetric capacity of the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">The length of a screw element is reported as the ratio of length of the element divided by the diameter of the element.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">This example uses TLS and SLS. Screw element A is a TLS with a 1.0 pitch and a 1.5 length ratio. Screw element B is a TLS with a 1.0 pitch and a 1.0 L/D ratio. Screw element C is a SLS with a &#xbc; pitch and a 1.0 length ratio. Screw element D is a SLS and a &#xbc; pitch and a &#xbd; length ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">Bilobal paddles, E, serving as mixing elements, are also included in series with the SLS and TLS screw elements in order to enhance mixing. Various configurations of bilobal paddles and reversing elements F, single and twin lead screws threaded in the opposite direction, are used in order to control flow and corresponding mixing time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051">In zone <b>1</b>, the hydroxyl polymer is fed into the solid feed port at a rate of 230 grams/minute using a K-Tron (Pitman, N.J.) loss-in-weight feeder. This hydroxyl polymer is combined inside the extruder (zone <b>1</b>) with water, an external plasticizer, added at the liquid feed at a rate of 146 grams/minute using a Milton Roy (Ivyland, Pa.) diaphragm pump (1.9 gallon per hour pump head) to form a hydroxyl polymer/water slurry. This slurry is then conveyed down the barrel of the extruder and cooked. Table 1 describes the temperature, pressure, and corresponding function of each zone of the extruder.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0053">After the slurry exits the extruder, part of the hydroxyl polymer/water slurry is dumped and another part (100 g) is fed into a Zenith&#xae;, type PEP II (Sanford N.C.) and pumped into a SMX style static mixer (Koch-Glitsch, Woodridge, Ill.). The static mixer is used to combine additional additives such as crosslinking agents, crosslinking facilitators, additional external plasticizers, such as additional water or other external plasticizers, with the hydroxyl polymer/water slurry to form a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition. The additives are pumped into the static mixer via PREP 100 HPLC pumps (Chrom Tech, Apple Valley Minn.). These pumps provide high pressure, low volume addition capability.

<p id="p-0058" num="0064">During operation of the rotary spinning system <b>22</b>, the rotary spinning die <b>24</b>, as it revolves around axis R, imparts inertia to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b>, which is present in the receiving compartment <b>30</b> and in contact with a wall of the rotary spinning die <b>24</b>.

As a result of the inertia imparted to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>28</b> and as a result of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> exiting the rotary spinning die <b>24</b> through at least one hole <b>36</b>, the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> is attenuated into one or more fibers <b>44</b>. As a result of the inertia imparted to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b>, attenuating fluid stream is necessary to attenuate the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> into fibers <b>44</b>. However, in another example, an attenuation fluid stream may also be applied to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> to additionally aid the attenuation of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> into hydroxyl polymer-containing fibers <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0065">The feeding/supplying of a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> to the rotary spinning die <b>24</b> can be a batch and/or a continuous process.

<p id="p-0061" num="0067">The diameter of the rotary spinning die <b>24</b> may be such that its outer annular wall's exterior surface <b>48</b> exhibits a tip velocity of from about 1 m/s to about 300 m/s and/or from about 10 m/s to about 200 m/s and/or from about 10 m/s to about 100 m/s during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">The at least one hole <b>36</b> of the outer annular wall <b>28</b> may be configured to provide a throughput of hydroxyl polymer-containing composition <b>34</b> of from about 0.1 to about 10 grams/hole/minute (&#x201c;ghm&#x201d;) and/or from about 0.2 to about 10 ghm and/or from about 0.3 to about 8 ghm. The grams/hole/minute can be thought of as grams/fiber generating stream/minute for rotary spinning die examples, such as a disc that has no outer annular wall with holes through which the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition exits the rotary spinning die, examples of which are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">The rotary spinning die may be a disc having a surface upon which the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition may come into contact with prior to exiting the disc in the form of fibers.

The multiple materials may be made to contact one another yielding composite fibers, or they may be maintained as separate fibers. If the materials contact one another, the contact may yield fibers possibly covering a range of structures. One material may entirely enclose another material along the length of the fiber, often referred to as sheath/core fibers. Alternatively, the materials may be more simply adjacent to one another, yielding side-by-side fibers. Such side-by-side fibers may not be continuous in all material streams, yielding discontinuous multi-component fibers.</p>

The different components of multicomponent fibers can be arranged in substantially distinct regions across the cross-section of the fiber and extend continuously along the length of the fiber. The different components of the multicomponent fiber can be similar in composition, such as a first modified starch and a second, differently modified starch.

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">High Polymers</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0139">&#x201c;High polymers&#x201d; as used herein mean high weight average molecular weight polymers which are substantially compatible with the hydroxyl polymer can be incorporated into the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition. The molecular weight of a suitable polymer should be sufficiently high to effectuate entanglements and/or associations with the hydroxyl polymer. The high polymer preferably has a substantially linear chain structure, though a linear chain having short (C1-C3) branches or a branched chain having one to three long branches are also suitable for use herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially compatible&#x201d; means when heated to a temperature above the softening and/or the melting temperature of the composition, the high polymer is capable of forming a substantially homogeneous mixture with the hydroxyl polymer (i.e., the composition appears transparent or translucent to the naked eye).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0140">The Hildebrand solubility parameter (&#x3b4;) can be used to estimate the compatibility between hydroxyl polymer and the high polymer. Generally, substantial compatibility between two materials can be expected when their solubility parameters are similar. It is known that water has a &#x3b4;<sub>water </sub>value of 48.0 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, which is the highest among common solvents, probably due to the strong hydrogen bonding capacity of water. Starch typically has a &#x3b4;<sub>starch </sub>value similar to that of cellulose (about 34 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0141">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that polymers suitable for use herein preferably interact with the hydroxyl polymers on the molecular level in order to form a substantially compatible mixture. The interactions range from the strong, chemical type interactions such as hydrogen bonding between high polymer and hydroxyl polymer, to merely physical entanglements between them. The high polymers useful herein are preferably high weight average molecular weight, substantially linear chain molecules. The highly branched structure of a amylopectin molecule favors the branches to interact intramolecularly, due to the proximity of the branches within a single molecule. Thus, it is believed that the amylopectin molecule has poor or ineffective entanglements/interactions with other hydroxyl polymers, particularly starch molecules. The compatibility with hydroxyl polymer enables suitable high polymers to be intimately mixed and chemically interact and/or physically entangle with the branched amylopectin molecules such that the amylopectin molecules associate with one another via the polymers. The high molecular weight of the polymer enables it to simultaneously interact/entangle with several hydroxyl polymers. That is, the high polymers function as molecular links for hydroxyl polymers. The linking function of the high polymers is particularly important for starches high in amylopectin content. The entanglements and/or associations between hydroxyl polymer and high polymer enhance the melt extensibility of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition such that the composition is suitable for extensional processes. In one example, it is found that the composition can be melt attenuated uniaxially to a very high draw ratio (greater than 1000).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0142">In order to effectively form entanglements and/or associations with the hydroxyl polymers, the high polymer suitable for use herein should have a weight-average molecular weight of at least 500,000 g/mol. Typically the weight average molecular weight of the polymer ranges from about 500,000 to about 25,000,000, preferably from about 800,000 to about 22,000,000, more preferably from about 1,000,000 to about 20,000,000, and most preferably from about 2,000,000 to about 15,000,000. The high molecular weight polymers are preferred due to the ability to simultaneously interact with several starch molecules, thereby increasing extensional melt viscosity and reducing melt fracture.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0143">Suitable high polymers have a &#x3b4;<sub>polymer </sub>such that the difference between &#x3b4;<sub>starch </sub>and &#x3b4;<sub>polymer </sub>is less than about 10 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, preferably less than about 5 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, and more preferably less than about 3 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>. Nonlimiting examples of suitable high polymers include polyacrylamide and derivatives such as carboxyl modified polyacrylamide; acrylic polymers and copolymers including polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, and their partial esters; vinyl polymers including polyvinylacetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene vinyl acetate, polyethyleneimine, and the like; polyamides; polyalkylene oxides such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polyethylenepropylene oxide, and mixtures thereof. Copolymers made from mixtures of monomers selected from any of the aforementioned polymers are also suitable herein. Other exemplary high polymers include water soluble polysaccharides such as alginates, carrageenans, pectin and derivatives, chitin and derivatives, and the like; gums such as guar gum, xanthum gum, agar, gum arabic, karaya gum, tragacanth gum, locust bean gum, and like gums; water soluble derivatives of cellulose, such as alkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylcellulose, carboxyalkylcellulose, and the like; and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0144">Some polymers (e.g., polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid) are generally not available in the high molecular weight range (i.e., 500,000 or higher). A small amount of crosslinking agents may be added to create branched polymers of suitably high molecular weight useful herein.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0145">The high polymer may be added to the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition of the present invention in an amount effective to visibly reduce the melt fracture and capillary breakage of fibers during the spinning process such that fibers having relatively consistent diameter can be spun. These high polymers are typically present in the range from about 0.001 to about 10 wt %, preferably from about 0.005 to about 5 wt %, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 1 wt %, and most preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 wt % of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition. It is surprising to find that at a relatively low concentration, these polymers significantly improve the melt extensibility of the hydroxyl polymer-containing composition.</p>

<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Test Methods</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Method A. Fiber Diameter Test Method</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0163">A web comprising fibers of appropriate basis weight (approximately 5 to 20 grams/square meter) is cut into a rectangular shape, approximately 20 mm by 35 mm. The sample is then coated using a SEM sputter coater (EMS Inc, Pa., USA) with gold so as to make the fibers relatively opaque. Typical coating thickness is between 50 and 250 nm. The sample is then mounted between two standard microscope slides and compressed together using small binder clips. The sample is imaged using a 10&#xd7; objective on an Olympus BHS microscope with the microscope light-collimating lens moved as far from the objective lens as possible. Images are captured using a Nikon D1 digital camera. A Glass microscope micrometer is used to calibrate the spatial distances of the images. The approximate resolution of the images is 1 &#x3bc;m/pixel. Images will typically show a distinct bimodal distribution in the intensity histogram corresponding to the fibers and the background. Camera adjustments or different basis weights are used to achieve an acceptable bimodal distribution. Typically 10 images per sample are taken and the image analysis results averaged.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0164">The images are analyzed in a similar manner to that described by B. Pourdeyhimi, R. and R. Dent in &#x201c;Measuring fiber diameter distribution in nonwovens&#x201d; (Textile Res. J. 69(4) 233-236, 1999). Digital images are analyzed by computer using the MATLAB (Version. 6.3) and the MATLAB Image Processing Tool Box (Version 3.) The image is first converted into a grayscale. The image is then binarized into black and white pixels using a threshold value that minimizes the intraclass variance of the thresholded black and white pixels. Once the image has been binarized, the image is skeletonized to locate the center of each fiber in the image. The distance transform of the binarized image is also computed. The scalar product of the skeletonized image and the distance map provides an image whose pixel intensity is either zero or the radius of the fiber at that location. Pixels within one radius of the junction between two overlapping fibers are not counted if the distance they represent is smaller than the radius of the junction. The remaining pixels are then used to compute a length-weighted histogram of fiber diameters contained in the image.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Method B. Shear Viscosity of a Hydroxyl Polymer-Containing Composition</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0165">The shear viscosity of a hydroxyl polymer-containing composition is measured using a capillary rheometer, Goettfert Rheograph 6000, manufactured by Goettfert USA of Rock Hill S.C., USA. The measurements are conducted using a capillary die having a diameter D of 1.0 mm and a length L of 30 mm (i.e., L/D=30). The die is attached to the lower end of the rheometer's 20 mm barrel, which is held at a die test temperature of 75&#xb0; C. A preheated to die test temperature, 60 g sample of the polymer melt composition is loaded into the barrel section of the rheometer. Rid the sample of any entrapped air. Push the sample from the barrel through the capillary die at a set of chosen rates 1,000-10,000 seconds<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. An apparent shear viscosity can be calculated with the rheometer's software from the pressure drop the sample experiences as it goes from the barrel through the capillary die and the flow rate of the sample through the capillary die. The log (apparent shear viscosity) can be plotted against log (shear rate) and the plot can be fitted by the power law, according to the formula &#x3b7;=K&#x3b3;<sup>n&#x2212;1</sup>, wherein K is the material's viscosity constant, n is the material's thinning index and &#x3b3; is the shear rate. The reported apparent shear viscosity of the composition herein is calculated from an interpolation to a shear rate of 3,000 sec<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>using the power law relation.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">C. Capillary Number Test Method</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0166">When a fluid stream emerges from a die opening, the surface forces (surface tension) between the fluid and the air (or gas) encourage the fluid to break into droplets. Water, emerging from a faucet or a hose, tends to break into droplets instead of maintaining a single stream. This droplet tendency is reduced by raising the fluid velocity (or flowrate) of the fluid, raising the fluid viscosity, or lowering the fluid surface tension. At higher fluid velocities, the fluid will stay as a coherent jet for a greater distance. At higher viscosities, the fluid will also be more stable, such as pouring honey instead of water.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0167">The Capillary number is a dimensionless number used to characterize the likelihood of this droplet breakup. A larger capillary number indicates greater fluid stability upon exiting the die. The Capillary number is defined as follows:</p>
