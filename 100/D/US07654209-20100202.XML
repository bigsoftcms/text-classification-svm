<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to embroidery machine, and more particularly, to an embroidery machine, in which a presser foot (a cloth pressing member) can be separately driven by its own drive source, independently from the drive source of a needle bar.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, an embroidery machine is a biaxial positioning control machine in which an embroidery stitch frame for fixing fabric undergoes horizontal motion in x-axis and y-axis directions while a needle bar thereof moves up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since this embroidery machine does needlework while the embroidery stitch frame, fixing the fabric, is transferred in x-axis and y-axis directions, the precise and constant-speed movement of the embroidery frame has a close relationship to the quality of an embroidered pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a drive source of the embroidery machine, which transfers the needle bar in vertical directions and the embroidery stitch frame in the x-axis and y-axis directions, is generally implemented with a servo motor, which can be precisely controlled, or a motor, the position of which can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating of the embroidery machine and partially expanded view of sewing head, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a drive structure for a presser foot and a needle bar of the embroidery machine of the prior art, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is an expanded view of part &#x201c;A&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of sewing heads <b>2</b> is fixedly arranged in the front portion of an upper beam of an embroidery machine <b>1</b> along the length thereof. In each of the sewing heads <b>2</b>, an upper shaft (not shown) is arranged to laterally extend through a sewing arm <b>3</b>, and a needle bar support case <b>4</b> is assembled to the front portion of the sewing arm <b>3</b> in such a fashion that the needle bar support case <b>4</b> is laterally movable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the lower portion of the needle bar support case <b>4</b>, a plurality of presser feet <b>5</b> (so-called cloth pressing members), which act to prevent a sheet of cloth to be sewn from coming loose when it is being sewn, is provided. Each of the presser feet <b>5</b> is set to be vertically movable in cooperation with a needle bar (see the reference number <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The needle bar <b>18</b> is set to be vertically movable using the rotation driving force of an upper shaft motor (not shown), and a needle (not shown), which forms sewing eyes in the sheet of cloth to be sewn, is mounted on the lower end of the needle bar <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Now the drive structure for the presser foot <b>5</b> and the needle bar <b>18</b> will be described more fully with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. A needle bar driving cam <b>10</b> is attached to the outer circumference of an upper shaft, which rotates using the rotation driving force of the upper shaft motor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A needle bar driving rod <b>11</b> is mounted on the outer periphery of the needle bar driving cam <b>10</b> in such a fashion that the needle bar driving rod <b>11</b> is vertically displaceable in response to the amount of eccentricity of the needle bar driving cam <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The needle bar driving rod <b>11</b> is connected to an intermediate portion of a needle bar drive lever <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the needle bar drive lever <b>12</b> can vertically pivot around a predetermined rotation point by a predetermined amount corresponding to the amount of eccentricity of the needle bar driving cam <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The needle bar drive lever <b>12</b> is connected, by a needle bar link (not shown), to a needle bar drive block <b>13</b>, which is vertically movable on a needle bar guide shaft <b>15</b>, so that the needle bar drive block <b>13</b> can vertically move to the extent that the needle bar drive lever <b>12</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A needle bar controlling block <b>14</b>, which is rotatably provided inside the needle bar drive block <b>13</b>, can be coupled to or decoupled from a needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a, </i>which is fastened to the outer circumference of the needle bar <b>18</b>. A presser foot holder <b>6</b> is mounted on the outer circumference of the needle bar <b>18</b> under the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a, </i>in such a fashion that it can move vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A spring <b>19</b> having a predetermined elastic force is mounted between the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a </i>and the presser foot holder <b>6</b>, and cooperates with the needle driver <b>18</b> in order to drive the presser foot <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The presser foot holder <b>6</b> is fixedly fastened with the presser foot <b>5</b>, which prevents the sheet of cloth to be sewn from coming loose while it is being sewn. Now the drive structure for the needle bar <b>18</b> and the presser foot <b>5</b>, as constructed above, will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The driving force of the upper shaft rotates the motor upper shaft, which in turn rotates the needle bar driving cam <b>10</b> fastened to the upper shaft, so that the needle bar driving rod <b>11</b>, the needle bar drive lever <b>12</b> and the needle bar drive block <b>13</b> operate cooperatively.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a position where the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a, </i>which is fixedly fastened to the outer circumference of the needle bar <b>18</b>, and the needle bar controlling block <b>14</b>, which is inserted into the needle bar drive block <b>13</b>, are coupled with each other, the needle bar <b>18</b> vertically reciprocates in response to the vertical movement of the needle bar drive block <b>13</b>. Here, the presser foot holder <b>6</b>, fastened to the presser foot <b>5</b>, operates using the elastic force of the spring <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">That is, the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a, </i>which moves downward, generates a pressing force on the spring <b>19</b>, thereby pressing down the presser foot holder <b>6</b>. Then, the presser foot <b>5</b>, fastened to the presser foot holder <b>6</b>, moves downward in cooperation with the needle bar <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Conversely, when the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a </i>moves upward, the pressing force on the spring <b>19</b> is released, so that the needle bar holder <b>17</b><i>a </i>on the lower end of the needle bar <b>18</b> pulls the presser foot <b>5</b> upward, thereby moving the presser foot <b>5</b> upward.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The conventional drive structure for the presser foot <b>5</b>, as described above, does not have a driving source, but operates in cooperation with the movement of the needle bar <b>18</b>. Accordingly, there are problems in that an operator or a user cannot freely change some parameters of the presser foot <b>5</b>, such as the stroke (i.e., the distance between the top dead point and the bottom dead point), the bottom dead point, and the moving track.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During the downward movement of the presser foot <b>5</b>, the presser foot holder <b>6</b> contacts the outer surface of the needle bar support case <b>4</b> to stop the presser foot <b>5</b>. However, the contact between the needle bar support case <b>4</b> and the presser foot holder <b>6</b> produces noise upon impact. Furthermore, since contact is frequent, the presser foot holder <b>6</b> is constantly vulnerable to damage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention has been made to solve the foregoing problems with the prior art, and therefore the present invention provides an embroidery machine, which has a separate drive structure for a presser foot, so that the stroke or the lower end point of a presser foot can be freely changed and the moving track of the presser foot can be freely generated.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, an embroidery machine according to the present invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a sewing head having a drive structure for a presser foot according to an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the drive structure for a presser foot according to the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is an expanded view of part &#x201c;B&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, seen from one direction, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is an expanded view of part &#x201c;B&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, seen from the other direction, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side elevation view illustrating the drive structure for a presser foot according to the present invention, in the mounted position.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the embroidery machine of the present invention is constructed in such a fashion that each of the needle bar and the presser foot is actuated by an independent drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the drive structure for a presser foot, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 5</figref>, a rotation driving force from an upper shaft motor (not shown) rotates a presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, which is fastened to the outer circumference of an upper shaft <b>104</b>, which extends through a sewing arm <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Then, a presser foot driving power transmission unit rocks in cooperation with the rotation of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, and a presser foot <b>128</b>, which is connected to the presser foot driving power transmission unit, vertically rocks in cooperation with the presser foot driving power transmission unit.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, in the presser foot driving power transmission unit, a presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b> vertically reciprocates in cooperation with the rotation of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, a presser foot drive lever <b>114</b>, which is connected to the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b>, vertically pivots about the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the central portion, and a presser foot drive link <b>116</b> vertically reciprocates according to the amount that the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> pivots.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A presser foot drive block <b>118</b> also reciprocally moves along a needle bar guide shaft <b>130</b> according to the amount of vertical movement of the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to this embodiment of the present invention, the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b> is implemented with a presser foot drive rod, which is coupled to the outer circumference of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, thereby rotatably housing the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b> therein, and thus vertically reciprocates according to the amount of eccentricity of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, which rotates in cooperation with the rotation of the upper shaft <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be understood, however, that the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b> of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned structure, but may be implemented with a cam roller (not shown), which contacts a cam follow, that is, a grooved track in the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> is pivotally connected, at a first end thereof, to the lower end of the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b>, and is connected, at a second end thereof, to the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>, so that the two ends of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> reciprocally pivot around the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the central portion according to the amount of vertical movement of the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The presser foot drive link <b>116</b> is rotatably connected, at a first end thereof, to the second end of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b>, and is pivotally connected, at a second end thereof, to the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>, so that it can vertically reciprocate according to the amount that the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> pivots.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the outer circumference of the needle bar <b>132</b> to be vertically slidable, and is fastened to a presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b, </i>which is disposed inside the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>. The presser foot drive block <b>118</b> is also connected to the second end of the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>. Accordingly, the presser foot drive block <b>118</b> can vertically reciprocate according to the amount of vertical movement of the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A buffer spring <b>118</b><i>c </i>having a predetermined amount of elasticity is housed, together with the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b, </i>inside the presser foot drive block <b>118</b> in such a fashion that the buffer spring <b>118</b><i>c </i>can vertically reciprocate on the outer circumference of the needle bar guide shaft <b>130</b> while constantly pressing the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b. </i>This, as a result, makes it possible to prevent both the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b </i>from being damaged by an unexpected malfunction of the presser foot <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Here, like the above-mentioned needle control block (see the reference number <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b </i>can be set to pivot about the needle bar guide shaft <b>130</b> inside the presser foot drive block <b>118</b> so as to couple with or decouple from the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>or, on the contrary, can be fixed so as not to pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>coupled with the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b, </i>is set to be vertically reciprocable on the outer circumference, and is coupled, at one portion thereof, with a presser foot assembly <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The presser foot assembly <b>120</b> has a presser foot guide bushing <b>122</b>, which is fastened to the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>and a presser foot support <b>124</b>, which is fixedly coupled with the bottom of the presser foot guide bushing <b>122</b>. The presser foot support <b>124</b> is arranged to be parallel to the needle bar <b>132</b>, and is coupled, at the bottom thereof, with the presser foot <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The presser foot assembly <b>120</b> also includes an additional coupling bushing <b>126</b>, which fixedly holds both the lower end of the presser foot support <b>124</b> and the lower end of the needle bar <b>132</b>. The presser foot <b>128</b> is detachably coupled to the lower end of the presser foot support <b>124</b> via suitable fasteners, such as male and female threads, so that it can be freely mounted to and removed from the presser foot support <b>124</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference number <b>134</b>, which is not described, indicates a needle bar support case.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The drive structure for a presser foot according to this embodiment of the present invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the upper shaft <b>104</b> rotates using the rotation driving force of the upper motor (not shown), the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, coupled to the upper shaft <b>104</b>, rotates in cooperation therewith. In response to the rotation of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>, the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b> vertically reciprocates according to the amount of eccentricity of the presser foot drive cam <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b> moves vertically, the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b>, connected to the lower end of the presser foot drive cam transmission member <b>110</b>, vertically pivots about the pivot point. In cooperation with this action, the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>, connected to the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> via the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>, vertically reciprocates on the needle bar guide shaft <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As the presser foot drive block <b>118</b> moves vertically, the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>fastened to the presser foot holder gripper <b>118</b><i>b, </i>which is housed inside the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>, vertically moves in cooperation with the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>. In cooperation with this action, the presser foot assembly <b>120</b>, fastened to the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>also moves vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, the needle bar <b>132</b>, connected to the bottom of the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>which is fastened to the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>, vertically moves inside the sewing head <b>100</b>, and the presser foot <b>128</b>, coupled to the lower end of the presser foot support <b>124</b>, also vertically operates.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the drive structure for a presser foot having a height adjustment mechanism according to the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is an expanded view of part &#x201c;C&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is an expanded perspective view illustrating the construction of the height adjustment mechanism of a sewing machine according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>, the height adjustment mechanism of the present invention acts to displace the pivot point of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> in a predetermined direction, thereby adjusting the upper dead point and the lower dead point of the presser foot <b>128</b>, and includes a drive motor <b>140</b>, a drive pulley <b>142</b>, operably coupled with the drive motor <b>140</b>, a follower pulley <b>143</b>, which is connected to and rotates following the drive pulley <b>142</b>, and an eccentric member <b>145</b>, which displaces the pivot point of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> using the driving force of the drive motor <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The drive motor <b>140</b> has a motor shaft protruding from one face thereof, and the front face of a case storing the drive motor <b>140</b> is bolt-fastened to one face of the sewing arm <b>102</b> via a connector bracket <b>141</b>, which has a U-shaped cross section when seen from the front.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The drive pulley <b>142</b> is attached to the motor shaft of the drive motor <b>140</b>, and is connected, via a belt <b>146</b>, to the follower pulley <b>143</b>, which has a larger diameter. The eccentric member <b>145</b> extends through both a hollow space <b>144</b><i>a </i>of a cylindrical eccentric member support <b>144</b> and a hole of the follower pulley <b>143</b>, and is then connected to the follower pulley <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">While the drive pulley <b>142</b> and the follower pulley <b>143</b> are connected to each other via the belt <b>146</b> in this embodiment of the present invention, they may be directly meshed with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The eccentric member <b>145</b> has a cylindrical body <b>145</b><i>a, </i>a drive shaft <b>145</b><i>b, </i>which protrudes from one face of the cylindrical body <b>145</b><i>a, </i>and a fastening protrusion <b>145</b><i>c, </i>which is formed in the opposite face of the cylindrical body <b>145</b><i>a </i>and eccentrically protrudes from the center thereof. The eccentric member <b>145</b> is connected, at the drive shaft <b>145</b><i>b, </i>to the follower pulley <b>143</b>, and at the meshing protrusion <b>145</b><i>c, </i>to the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the presser drive lever <b>114</b>, so that the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> can be displaced upward or downward by the eccentric member <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to the present invention, the position of the upper and lower dead points of the presser foot <b>128</b> can be easily and correctly controlled, since the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b> can be displaced upward or downward through the control of the drive motor <b>140</b>. Accordingly, this makes it possible to automatically control a sewing operation in response to the thickness of a sheet of cloth to be sewn.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">That is, in the case where the presser foot <b>128</b> is required to be raised to a predetermined height, the drive pulley <b>142</b> rotates in response to the counterclockwise rotation of the drive motor <b>140</b>. The rotation of the drive pulley <b>142</b> is transmitted to the follower pulley <b>143</b>, and then, through the eccentric member support <b>144</b> and the eccentric member <b>145</b>, to the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, the transmission of the rotation, as described above, acts to raise the presser foot drive block <b>118</b> through the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>. In response to the upward movement of the needle bar <b>132</b>, connected to the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>which is fastened to the presser foot drive block <b>118</b>, the presser foot <b>128</b> also rises to a predetermined height.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the opposite case, where the presser foot <b>128</b> is about to descend to a predetermined height, a rotational force from clockwise operation of the drive motor <b>140</b> acts, through the presser foot drive link <b>116</b>, on the presser foot <b>118</b>, thereby causing the presser foot <b>118</b> to descend. Then, the needle bar <b>132</b>, connected to the presser foot holder <b>118</b><i>a, </i>moves downward, and, in response to this descent, the presser foot <b>128</b> also moves downward.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, the presser foot height adjustment mechanism makes it possible to adjust the height of the lower end point of the presser foot <b>128</b> according to the thickness of the sheet of cloth to be sewn. That is, it is possible to adjust the height of the presser foot <b>128</b> by displacing the pivot point <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the presser foot drive lever <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a sewing operation, when a sheet of cloth to be sewn is relatively thick, the height adjustment mechanism is operated to raise the height of the lower dead point of the presser foot <b>128</b>. When the sheet of cloth to be sewn is relatively thin, the height adjustment mechanism is operated to lower the height of the lower dead point of the presser foot <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A program can be used to automatically control the drive motor <b>140</b> according to the thickness of the sheet of cloth to be sewn. For example, in the case where a sewing pattern is inputted, an embroidery stitch frame, to which fabric is fixed, is slightly moved in x-axis and y-axis directions, followed by manually determining the position at which the thickness of the sheet of cloth is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Then, the determined position and the height of the presser foot <b>128</b> from a needle plate (not shown) at the determined position (or the number of drive pulses inputted to the drive motor) are inputted as data, or rather than the input data, the number of needles up to the position where the thickness of the sheet of cloth changes is set.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Accordingly, in a sewing operation, when the position where the thickness of the sheet of cloth changes is reached, the number of pulses (or the number of needles) is supplied according to the height inputted to the drive motor <b>140</b>, so that the lower end point of the presser foot <b>128</b> can be automatically controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to the invention as set forth above, the presser foot is driven by a separate drive structure, independently from the needle bar, so that the moving track of the presser foot can be freely generated, and thus the stroke or the lower end point of the presser foot can be freely produced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, the height adjustment mechanism can adjust the height of the presser foot according to the type or thickness of a sheet of cloth to be sewn, thereby enhancing the efficiency of an embroidery machine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">While the embroidery machine of the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments and the accompanying drawings, it is not to be limited thereto. It is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art can substitute, change or modify the embodiments in various forms without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
