<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An extension tool is provided for stretching a sheet-shaped material over its entirety with minimal adjusting portions and uniform tension. Four corner members are disposed along with four frame members for forming a rectangular frame. Four rods are disposed so as to pass through the four frame members and allow the sides and corners to move towards and away from each other for adjusting the size of the frame. One set of corner members are located on the diagonals and are provided with a moving mechanism for moving the rods along the sides of the rectangle. The extension tool for tensioning the material further comprises a transmission mechanism for converting the movement of a rod in a first side of the rectangle between first corner pairs into a reversing and approaching movement of a second rod in a second side of the frame between second corner pairs.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a frame with a new structure where a screen to be used in screen printing is stretched.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also relates to an extension tool for the purpose of stretching a sheet-like material, e.g., a sheet-shaped or mesh material made of metal, resin, etc. to be used in screen printing, a sheet-shaped material such as a canvas to be used for a texture in oil painting, or a sheet-shaped material such as leather to be stretched on a percussion instrument body such as a drum.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A screen printing screen sheet with a relatively simple structure has been conventionally used, in which a metal mesh with lower elasticity for a portion where an image is to be formed is arranged at the central portion of the screen and a mesh with a relatively higher elasticity is disposed on the periphery of the portion where the image is to be formed as a support member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a screen, elasticity and expandability are entirely different, depending on the size of the portion where the image is to be formed or depending on the material used for the screen. In this respect, it is extremely necessary to adjust the screen for preparing the screen to suit the purpose required on the object to be printed, and this adjustment is difficult to carry out.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The screen for screen printing is stretched by applying tension to the screen. For this reason, a screen frame must have sufficient strength to endure the tension, and wooden or metal material having high strength is used. Accordingly, the screen frame is weighty and bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A screen frame needs a large-scale pulling means when adjusting the length of the screen frame sides, and because a large-scale pulling means must be used, the structure is not very convenient to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, it is not always easy to stretch the screen or to adjust the tension on the spread screen by combining the screen frame for freely adjusting the length of each side of the screen frame with a tool used to fix the screen. Also, it is difficult to freely attach or remove the means to which the screen is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in a case where the object to be printed is distorted or has unevenness in the extension of the screen, or in a case where distortion or deviation occurs in an embossed printing, it is difficult to attain a high degree of accuracy in printing by compensating or adjusting based on these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once the screen has been fixed on the screen frame, it is further difficult to adjust the distortion or deviation of images.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The conventional tool for stretching a sheet-shaped material comprising an expandable frame body has been practiced as adjusting the positions of four sides of the frame respectively to change the distance between the frame sides so as to adjust the tension of the sheet-shaped material stretched on the extension tool.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A frame with a plurality of mechanisms for finely adjusting the tension on the stretched screen is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application No. 1-141027, Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application No. 55-136533 and International Patent Publication WO 92/03231.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A frame in which a screen is fixed on a support frame by an anchor pin to add tension in advance to the screen, the support frame is attached to an extension frame and the tension is adjusted by a screw, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,482,343, U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,165 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,588.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A frame for stretching a screen, in which the screen is fixed on a support frame by using grooves and fixing members, the support frame is mounted on the frame for stretching the screen and the length of frame sides is changed by using a screw mechanism or a fluid cylinder on the frame, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,611.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A frame, in which the tension is finely adjusted by rotating the frame where the screen is stretched, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,076,162, U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,171 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,265,534.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A frame, in which tension is added in advance by fixing the screen on a support frame by using an adhesive agent and the support frame is attached to the frame by means of an anchor and the frame is finely adjusted by rotating a screw or a frame member, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,802,971.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In these types of screen extension frames, there are many points to be adjusted. Also, when adjustment is made at a point, the tension on other points is also changed, and thus it is difficult to stretch the sheet-shaped material over its entirety under the tension as desired. This means that a long period of time is required for adjusting the tension. Further, when the screen is mounted on the frame, a lot of time and labor are required for the operations of mounting and removing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Under such circumstances, the present inventor has developed, as shown in International Patent Publication WO 02/55304, an extension tool with a new structure, in which it is possible to easily adjust the tension by using four mechanisms.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is an object of the present invention to provide an extension tool for a sheet-shaped material, by which it is possible to easily stretch the sheet-shaped material as practical as possible and to stretch the sheet-shaped material over its entirety by uniform tension at relatively fewer adjusting points.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To attain the above object, the present invention provides a tool for stretching a sheet-shaped material, which comprises a basic configuration of four corner members each disposed at a corner of a rectangle; four frame members, both ends of which are supported by corner members and are disposed between two opposite corner members respectively, in which each of the four frame members can move between the opposite corner members in a direction toward the opposite corner member and can move in a direction to approach to or in a direction away from the opposed frame member together with the two opposite corner members, which support both ends of the frame member; and four solid rods passing through each of the frame members and placed respectively between two opposite corner members, where each of the frame members or each of the corner members has an anchoring element to which the peripheral edge of the sheet-shaped material is anchored.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the extension tool for a sheet-shaped material according to the present invention in any of the arrangements as described above, it can be so designed that a moving mechanism is mounted at a corner of the corner member, having an insert, which can move in a direction of the corner toward the inner side of a rectangle formed by the four corner members, and a ball. The ball is movably disposed in a space, which is formed between a forward end of the insert and an each end of each rod, which is placed between the corner member provided with the moving mechanism and the opposite corner member, where the end of the rod is closer to the corner member with the moving mechanism, so that the ball is interposed between the forward end of the insert and the end of each rod and is always abutted to the end of each rod closer to the corner member with the moving mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case, on the corner member with the moving mechanism, a stopper can be provided, which limits the movement of the insert in a direction toward the inner side of a rectangle formed by the four corner members.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the basic arrangement of the present invention as described above, a further arrangement as will be described below is proposed. One corner member among the four corner members is provided with a moving mechanism, which is always in abutment with an end of a rod disposed between the corner member and one of the two opposite corner members, and which moves the rod in a direction toward the one of the two opposite corner members, and there is a fixed connection to an end of the rod which is disposed between the corner member and the other of the two opposite corner members.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also, a transmission mechanism is provided, where the movement of either one of the two rods, which extend toward each of the corner members other than the corner member provided with the moving mechanism, is converted to the movement of the other rod in a direction away from each of the corner members, and also, where the movement of either one of the two rods in a direction away from each of the corner members is followed by movement of the other rod in a direction toward each of the corner members.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the extension tool for a sheet-shaped material in any of the arrangements as described above according to the present invention, it can be so designed that each of the four frame members has a hollow portion, and four solid rods, each of which passes through the frame member and is disposed between two opposite corner members, are supported in the hollow portion respectively by support members which are placed in the hollow portion of the frame member and are disposed with a predetermined distance from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, a sheet-shaped material, such as a sheet or a mesh made of metal, resin, etc., as used in screen printing can be easily stretched on the screen extension frame, over the uniform tension even at fewer adjusting points.</p>
