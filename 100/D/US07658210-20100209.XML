<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to a loom and a method of operating a loom. Specifically, this disclosure relates to a portable loom that may be driven by an operator's chin.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a loom, it is required to selectively raise and lower the warp threads so that the weft thread may be passed through the shed. A shuttle may facilitate passing the weft through the shed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical looms provide shafts or harnesses, containing one or more heddles, that facilitate selectively raising and lowering the warp.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of a type of loom is a table loom. The table loom is generally placed on a table or stand. An operator manually moves the shafts or harnesses to manipulate the warp. This type of loom is not portable during operation. Additionally, because an operator must use her hands to move the shafts or harnesses, she must drop the shuttle periodically whenever the shafts or harnesses must be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another type of loom is a floor loom. A floor loom rests on a stand, and includes foot pedals called treadles. The treadles operatively connect to the shafts or harnesses. By manipulating the treadles, an operator may move the shafts or harnesses, thus creating a shed through which a weft may be passed. A floor loom frees up an operator's hands, so that she may continue to move the shuttle through the warp and need not drop the shuttle in order to manipulate the shafts or harnesses. This type of loom still presents the disadvantage, however, that it is not portable during operation. Additionally, the floor loom may be unsuitable for an operator who lacks full use of his or her legs or feet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other types of looms include power looms (whose shafts or harnesses are manipulated by machine), frame looms, and back strap looms. None of these looms are portable during operation. The looms may also require complex parts and mechanisms for their operation, which can lead to significant expense.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In light of the foregoing, there is a need for a loom that is inexpensive, portable during operation, and frees an operator's hands from having to manipulate the shafts or harnesses. Additionally, there is a need for a method of operating a portable loom, whereby an operator is able to transport the loom during operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To attain one or more of the above or other advantages, as embodied and broadly described herein, the disclosure is directed to a loom that includes a frame configured to hold a warp, and a shoulder support mounted on the frame. The shoulder support is configured to support the loom on the shoulders of an operator. The loom also includes a rotatable member mounted on the frame, with the rotatable member including a chin bar. The rotatable member is configured to rotate in response to a force applied to the chin bar by the chin of an operator. Rotation of the rotatable member is configured to create a shed in the warp.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is further directed to a tandem loom comprising a frame having a first end and a second end, with the frame configured to hold a first warp and a second warp. A first shoulder support is attachable to the first end of the frame and configured to be mounted on the shoulders of a first operator. A second shoulder support is attachable to the second end of the frame and configured to be mounted on the shoulders of a second operator. A first rotatable member is attached to the first end of the frame by a first axle, with the first rotatable member including a first chin bar and a first heddle. A second rotatable member is attached to the second end of the frame by a second axle, with the second rotatable member including a second chin bar and a second heddle. The first rotatable member is configured to translate a force on the first chin bar from the chin of the first operator into a force on the first heddle, causing the first heddle to create a shed in the first warp. The second rotatable member is configured to translate a force on the second chin bar from the chin of the second operator into a force on the second heddle, causing the second heddle to create a shed in the second warp.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure is yet further directed to a method of weaving with a loom. A loom is provided including a frame having a warp beam and a cloth beam. The loom also includes a shoulder support mounted on the frame, the shoulder support configured to engage the shoulders of an operator. The loom further includes a rotatable member mounted on the frame, the rotatable member including a chin bar and a heddle. The method further includes winding a warp between the warp beam and the cloth beam, with the warp being threaded through the heddle. The frame is mounted onto the shoulders of an operator. The method also includes applying a force to the chin bar with the chin of an operator and creating a shed in the warp.</p>

The loom may also include a warp beam <b>16</b> and a cloth beam <b>18</b>, which may be mounted on the frame <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A rotatable member <b>20</b> may also be provided. The rotatable member <b>20</b> may include a bar <b>22</b> and a heddle <b>24</b>. The heddle <b>24</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, defines series of slots <b>26</b> and holes <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rotatable member <b>20</b> attaches to the frame <b>10</b> by way of an axle <b>30</b>. According to this embodiment, the rotatable member <b>20</b> is configured to pivot around the axle <b>30</b> upon the application of force to the bar <b>22</b> in the direction of arrow F, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. When the rotatable member <b>20</b> pivots under the application of this force, the heddle <b>24</b> correspondingly moves up in direction R into position A. Once the force F has been removed, the heddle <b>24</b> returns in direction R&#x2032; to position B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the heddle <b>24</b> returns to position B due to gravity. It is also contemplated that the heddle <b>24</b> may return to position B due to a coil, spring, elastic band, or any other suitable device. It is further contemplated that the loom may be configured so that a force F&#x2032; is required to return the heddle <b>24</b> to position B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, the loom may be provided with a warp <b>40</b> and a weft <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The warp <b>40</b> is strung between the warp beam <b>16</b> and the cloth beam <b>18</b> as is well known in the art, with segments of the warp <b>40</b> passing alternately through the slots <b>26</b> and holes <b>28</b> defined by the heddle <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a first portion <b>82</b> of the warp passes through the holes <b>28</b>, while a second portion <b>84</b> of the warp passes through the slots <b>26</b>. Depending on the desired fineness of cloth, an operator may select different heddles <b>24</b> defining more or fewer slots <b>26</b> and holes <b>28</b>. The heddle <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is exemplary only. The present disclosure contemplates a heddle <b>24</b> defining any number of slots <b>26</b> and/or holes <b>28</b>. Additionally, the heddle <b>24</b> of the present disclosure may be integrated with the rotatable member <b>20</b>, or may be removable/replaceable. In an embodiment in which the heddle <b>24</b> may be removable or replaceable, it is contemplated that the heddle <b>24</b> may attach to the rotatable member <b>20</b> by a hook-and-loop fastener, latch, or any other suitable attachment mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To weave cloth, an operator may pass a weft <b>42</b> (with or without a shuttle, not shown) through the warp <b>40</b> in a first direction (into the page) when the heddle <b>24</b> is in position B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). With the heddle in position B, the first portion <b>82</b> of the warp is positioned below the second portion <b>84</b> of the warp, creating a shed <b>90</b> between the first portion <b>82</b> and second portion <b>84</b> of the warp. The weft <b>42</b> may thus be passed through the shed <b>90</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. An operator may then provide a force F to the bar <b>22</b>, thereby moving the heddle <b>24</b> to position A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) so that the first portion <b>82</b> of the warp is positioned above the second portion <b>84</b> of the warp, creating a shed <b>90</b>&#x2032;. The weft <b>42</b> may be passed back through the shed <b>90</b>&#x2032; in a second direction (out of the page). By removing force F from the bar <b>22</b>, the heddle <b>24</b> returns to position B, and the weaving process may be repeated as many times as may be suitable or desired. After the operator has finished weaving, the warp <b>40</b> and weft <b>42</b>, together forming a cloth, may be detached from the warp beam <b>16</b> and cloth beam <b>18</b> and the resulting cloth removed from the loom.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the loom may be designed to fit over the shoulders of an operator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the support arms <b>50</b> may be shoulder supports <b>50</b>, which are designed to fit over or around an operator's shoulders. Additionally, the support beam <b>52</b> may be a body support <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The body support <b>52</b> may be designed to rest against an operator's body.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the loom may be designed for operation under a force F provided by an operator's chin. In this configuration, the bar <b>22</b> may be a chin bar <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. With the loom in place on the shoulders and body of the operator, the operator may provide force F to the chin bar <b>22</b> by lowering her chin. Thus, an operator may move the heddle <b>24</b> up or down by moving her chin down or up. By operating the loom in conjunction with the warp <b>40</b> and the weft <b>42</b>, the loom may be used for weaving.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It may be desirable for the loom to be adjusted to fit the body of the operator. Accordingly, the support arms <b>50</b> may be adjustably attached to the frame <b>10</b> via fasteners <b>60</b>, such as wing nuts or screws. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, support arms <b>50</b> may define slots <b>51</b> designed to slide adjustably relative to fasteners <b>60</b>. Once support arms <b>50</b> have been desirably adjusted, fasteners <b>60</b> may be tightened to prevent the support arms <b>50</b> from moving further. Additional adjustments may be provided in an embodiment wherein lower support <b>14</b> adjustably attaches to the frame <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower support <b>14</b> may define slots <b>15</b> that allow lower support <b>14</b> to slide relative to fasteners <b>62</b>, such as wing nuts or screws, and frame <b>10</b>. The fasteners <b>62</b> may be tightened to secure lower support <b>14</b> into a desirable position. Yet further adjustments may be provided in an embodiment wherein the chin bar <b>22</b> is slidably attached to the rotatable member <b>20</b>, secured by fasteners <b>64</b>, such as wing nuts or screws, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. While sliding adjustments have been described, the present disclosure contemplates additional adjustments, including adjustments wherein one or more components may be rotatably adjusted relative to another component. For example, the lower support <b>14</b> may adjustably rotate relative to the frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another embodiment of a loom according to the present disclosure, which may provide the feature of a cloth roller <b>118</b> mounted on a frame <b>110</b>. The cloth roller <b>118</b> may be provided with pins (not shown) and/or a clamp (not shown) that may secure a warp to the cloth roller <b>118</b>. With the warp so secured, the cloth roller <b>118</b> may be rotated, thereby pulling or advancing the warp and causing the warp and cloth to wrap around the cloth roller <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the cloth roller <b>118</b> may be rotated through the use of a handle <b>138</b>. By manipulating the cloth roller <b>118</b>, an operator may adjust the slack of the warp, or may draw more warp toward the cloth roller <b>118</b> so that a longer cloth may be weaved. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cloth roller <b>118</b> is provided with a ratchet <b>128</b> that prevents the warp and/or cloth from unrolling from the cloth roller <b>118</b>. The present disclosure also contemplates cloth rollers <b>118</b> provided with a different mechanism that may prevent unrolling, such as a securing pin, wing nut, or any suitable locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The loom may also provide the feature of a warp roller <b>116</b>, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A warp roller <b>116</b> allows the loom to carry additional warp wrapped around the warp roller <b>116</b>. Thus, once an operator has weaved a suitable amount of cloth, additional warp may be unrolled from the warp roller <b>116</b> and drawn or advanced into the weaving area between the warp roller <b>116</b> and cloth roller <b>118</b>, so that additional cloth may be weaved. Additionally, an operator may adjust the slack of the warp by manipulating the warp roller <b>116</b>. The warp roller may be manipulated, in the illustrated embodiment, by using a handle <b>136</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the warp roller <b>116</b> may include a ratchet <b>126</b> that prevents the warp from unrolling from the warp roller <b>116</b>. The present embodiment also contemplates using any other suitable device for preventing the warp from unrolling from the warp roller <b>116</b>, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another embodiment provides a tandem frame <b>210</b> that is suitable for simultaneous loom operation by two operators, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A tandem frame <b>210</b> may include upper supports <b>212</b>, with each upper support <b>212</b> attaching to a shoulder support <b>250</b>. Two rotatable members <b>220</b> are also provided, with each being rotatably attached to the tandem frame <b>210</b> by an axle <b>230</b>. Each of the rotatable members <b>220</b> may include a heddle <b>224</b> and a chin bar <b>222</b>. The tandem frame <b>210</b> may also include two cloth beams <b>218</b> and two warp beams <b>216</b>, which may operate to support two separate warps (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To operate the loom illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a first operator may mount a loom according to the present embodiment on his shoulders using one set of shoulder supports <b>250</b>. A second operator may mount the loom on his shoulders using the other set of shoulder supports <b>250</b>. Each operator may then intermittently provide a force F to the chin bar <b>222</b>, causing his own heddle <b>224</b> to move up and down and allowing him to pass a weft (not shown) through a warp (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the above described loom has been depicted as utilizing an operator's chin, the disclosure is not intended to be limited to this particular structure. Therefore, alternatives for applying force F to a bar are intended to be within the scope of this disclosure, including all equivalent body parts that may be suitable for applying such force. For example, a loom may utilize an operator's thumb to provide force to the bar, which may be a thumb bar. In such an example, a wrist support may attach to the upper support of the frame in much the same way as the shoulder support of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to the bar and chin bar disclosed above, the device of this application may further include other elements for receiving the input force F, such as straps. Furthermore, it is contemplated that additional features of traditional looms may be incorporated with the loom of the present disclosure. Such additional features may include a beater, a back beam configured to support the warp, or a breast beam configured to support the cloth. Additionally, it is contemplated that one or more features of one embodiment may be added to, or substituted for, one or more features of another embodiment. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this disclosure to cover embodiments resulting from substitution and replacement of different features between different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The above described embodiments and arrangements are intended only to be exemplary of contemplated mechanisms. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the disclosure herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims.</p>
