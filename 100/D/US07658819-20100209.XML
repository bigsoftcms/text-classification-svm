<heading id="h-0001" level="1">COMPOSITION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a composition used for enhancing softness in paper products. The invention also relates to a papermaking process in which the composition is added to the cellulosic suspension or applied to a wet or dry paper web. The composition comprises an oil, wax or fat; at least one cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic polymer; an anionic compound selected from anionic surfactants and anionic microparticles; and one or more non-ionic surfactant(s).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Paper webs or sheets, usually called tissue or paper tissue webs, are commonly used in paper towels, napkins, facial and toilet tissues. The important characteristics for such papers are softness, absorbency and strength. There is an ongoing work to improve each of these characteristics without seriously affecting the others.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally pressed tissue paper and methods for making such paper are well known in the art. Such paper is typically made by draining and forming a cellulosic suspension on a wire. The cellulosic suspension is usually contained in the headbox before being deposited on a Fourdrinier wire to form a paper web. The paper web is then typically dewatered by vacuum dewatering and further dried by pressing operations wherein the web is subjected to pressure developed by opposing mechanical members, for example cylindrical rolls or an extended nip press. The dewatered web is then further pressed and dried by a steam drum apparatus known in the art as a Yankee cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional fluff and methods for making such paper are well known in the art. Such paper is typically made by making a paper sheet on a Fourdrinier wire and subsequently pressing and drying the paper sheet into bales or rolls. The dry paper is then defiberized using a hammermill or a pin defiberizer to form fluff. Typical products made from fluff are diapers and feminine hygiene products. Fluff can also be used to produce air laid paper products.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Softness is a tactile sensation perceived by the consumer holding a particular product, rubbing it across the skin or crumpling it within the hand. Softness of a sheet can be achieved by mechanical means. For example, the sheet can be calendered to flatten the crests formed when creping the sheet. The sheet can also be frictionally treated in order to eliminate any roughness. However, these approaches are often insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One way to make the paper softer is to add a softening compound to the cellulosic suspension. The softening compound interferes with the natural fibre-to-fibre bonding that occurs during sheet formation in papermaking processes. This reduction of bonding leads to a softer, or less harsh, sheet of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 98/07927 describes the production of soft absorbent paper products using a softener. The softener comprises a quaternary ammonium surfactant, a non-ionic surfactant as well as strength additives. The softening agent is added to the cellulosic suspension before the paper web is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A softening compound can also be applied to a dry or wet paper web e.g. by means of spraying. If the paper web is dry, the softening compound can also be printed on the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,204 describes a process for making soft tissue paper with functional-polysiloxane softener. The softener comprises a functional-polysiloxane, an emulsifier surfactant and surfactants which are noncationic. The softener is transferred to the dry paper web through a heater transfer surface. The softener is then pressed on the dry paper web.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">WO 97/30217 describes a composition used as a lotion to increase the softness of absorbent paper. The composition comprises an emollient which is preferably a fatty alcohol or a waxy ester. The composition also comprises a quaternary ammonium surfactant as well as one or more non-ionic or amphoteric emulsifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Most softening compounds, either added to the cellulosic suspension or applied to the paper web, contain quaternary ammonium surfactants. Since producers and consumers experience a growing environmental concern, quaternary ammonium surfactants are not always accepted. The quaternary ammonium surfactants are generally toxic to aquatic organisms and are generally considered undesired chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the invention to provide a composition for enhancing softness of a paper product.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of the invention to provide a composition substantially free from quaternary ammonium surfactants.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another object of the invention is to provide one single composition suitable for addition to the cellulosic suspension and applied to a wet or dry paper web, rather than several different compositions as described in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a composition that has a high tolerance towards anionic carryover from preceding production stages. Standard formulations can thus be neutralised in the wet end when small amounts of detrimental substances are released from the preceding production stages.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also an object of the invention to provide a composition that, when added to the cellulosic suspension, will impart low burst strength, high wetting rate as well as low defiberization energy to the paper to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is also a further object of the invention to provide a composition that, when added to the cellulosic suspension, will impart a low knot content to the product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention relates to a composition used for enhancing softness in paper products, preferably products prepared from tissue or fluff. The composition can be applied at various stages in the papermaking process. The composition can for instance be added in the wet end to the cellulosic suspension. A composition added to the cellulosic suspension to enhance softness of the product is called a debonder. The composition can also be applied to the paper web to enhance the surface feel of the product, e.g. the softness. If the composition is applied to a wet paper web, the composition is called a softener. If the composition is applied to a dry paper web, the composition is called a lotion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The composition of the invention comprises
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0021">(i) an oil, fat or wax</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0022">(ii) at least one non-ionic surfactant</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0023">(iii) at least one anionic compound selected from anionic microparticles and anionic surfactants</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0024">(iv) at least one polymer which is cationic, non-ionic or amphoteric,
<br/>
wherein the non-ionic surfactant is added in an amount of about 60 to about 1000 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">According to one embodiment, the composition is substantially free from quaternary ammonium surfactants. By &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; is meant that less than 5 wt % of the composition is comprised of quaternary ammonium surfactants, such as less than 1 wt %, or less than 0.5 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">Any oil, fat or wax, functioning as an emollient, can be used according to the invention. Suitable oils are refined and/or hydrogenated grade oils, such as vegetable oils like grape oil, olive oil, coconut oil, rape seed oil, sunflower oil, and palm oil, most preferably coconut oil. Other oils that can be used according to the invention are mineral oils and silicon oil.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">To retain the oil, fat or wax in a produced paper, a polymer functioning as a retention aid, is required. Suitable polymers for use as a retention agent or part of a retention system may be highly charged. According to one embodiment, the polymer is a cationic polymer. The polymers can be derived from natural or synthetic sources and they can be linear, branched or cross-linked, e.g. in the form of microparticles. Preferably, the polymer is water-soluble or water-dispersible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">Examples of suitable natural cationic polymers include cationic polysaccharides, e.g. starches, guar gums, cellulose derivatives, chitins, chitosans, glycans, galactans, glucans, xanthan gums, pectins, mannans, dextrins, preferably starches and guar gums. Suitable starches include potato, corn, wheat, tapioca, rice, waxy maize, barley, etc. Cationic synthetic organic polymers such as cationic chain-growth polymers may also be used, e.g. cationic vinyl addition polymers like acrylate-, acrylamide-, vinylamine-, vinylamide- and allylamine-based polymers, for example homo- and copolymers based on diallyldialkyl ammonium halide, e.g. diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride, as well as (meth)acrylamides and (meth)acrylates. Further polymers include cationic step-growth polymers, e.g. cationic polyamidoamines, polyethylene imines, polyamines, e.g. dimethylamine-epichlorhydrin copolymers; and polyurethanes. Further examples of suitable cationic organic polymers include those disclosed in WO 02/12626.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">According to one embodiment, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride, polyamines, cationic starch, amphoteric starch, and polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAAE), polyethylene imines and polyvinylamines.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The term &#x201c;step-growth polymer&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a polymer obtained by step-growth polymerization, also being referred to as step-reaction polymer and step-reaction polymerization respectively. The term &#x201c;chain-growth polymer&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a polymer obtained by chain-growth polymerization, also being referred to as</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">The polymer according to the invention can have a molecular weight of from about 10000 to about 10000000, such as from about 15000 to about 5000000, or from about 40000 to about 1000000.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">According to one embodiment, an anionic microparticle is comprised in the composition. Examples of suitable anionic microparticles include anionic silica microparticles, such as anionic colloidal silica particles, and smectite clays, most preferably anionic hydrophobically modified colloidal silica particles.

<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Non-ionic surfactants that can be used according to the invention include generally ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty acids or fatty alcohols. The ethoxylated fatty acids and fatty alcohols have preferably been ethoxylated with from about 1 to about 30 ethylene oxide (EO), or from about 4 to about 25 EO. The ethoxylated fatty acids and fatty alcohols may have from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms, or from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms. The propoxylated fatty acids and fatty alcohols may have been propoxylated with from about 1 to about 30 propylene oxide (PO), or from about 1 to about 8 PO.

<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The oil, fat or wax is suitably present in the composition in an amount of from about 1 to about 95, such as from about 30 to about 80, or from about 35 to about 75 wt % based on the dry weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The anionic compound is suitably present in the composition in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 10, such as from about 0.5 to about 4, or from about 0.6 to about 2 wt % based on the dry weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">According to one embodiment, the non-ionic surfactant is present in an amount of from about 70 to about 800, or from about 80 to about 600, or from about 100 to about 500, or from about 150 to about 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">The composition can be prepared by first mixing the oil, fat or wax together with the anionic and non-ionic surfactants to provide an emollient-surfactant blend. The emollient-surfactant blend may be heated to about 25 to about 70&#xb0; C. An aqueous solution containing the polymer is suitably prepared in which solution the polymer content constitutes from about 0.1 to about 50, e.g. from about 0.5 to about 25 wt %. The aqueous solution may be heated to from about 25 to about 70&#xb0; C. The emollient-surfactant blend may then be emulsified in the aqueous solution containing the polymer by a static mixer, an ultra-turrax high shear device or a homogenizer. The product emulsion can then be cooled to room temperature. The cooling can for example be performed by using a heat exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">According to one embodiment, the emollient surfactant mix is emulsified into the aqueous solution containing the polymer by means of a static mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The composition can be produced in advance and then be delivered as one product to the paper mill. The composition can also be prepared on site at the paper mill from the different components.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">It is also possible to add additional components to the composition. To avoid deterioration of the composition a preserving agent may be added. Several cosmetic additives can also be included, for example antioxidants, e.g. tocopherol, and aloe vera.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">The invention also relates to a process for production of paper comprising adding the composition as described herein to a cellulosic suspension wherein said process further comprises draining the cellulosic suspension on a wire to form a paper web.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">According to one embodiment, the composition may be added in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 15 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">When the debonder is used for manufacturing fluff, the composition is usually added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 15, such as from about 0.3 to about 10 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">When the debonder is used for manufacturing tissue, the composition is usually added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 15, such as from about 0.5 to about 4 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">When used as a debonder in this process, the composition, as already stated herein, is added to the cellulosic suspension before the paper web is formed. Use of debonders is very common when making fluff and tissue. The debonder will interfere with the natural fibre-to-fibre bonds so that the strength is reduced. By reducing the strength the softness of the fluff and the tissue products are increased. According to one embodiment, the components of the composition can be added separately to the cellulosic suspension. Preferably, an emulsion of the oil, fat or wax and the anionic and non-ionic surfactant can be added as a pre-blend and a polymer, e.g. in an aqueous solution, can be added as a separate component to the cellulosic suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">According to one embodiment, when the components are added separately, the amount of each component added to the cellulosic suspension corresponds to the amount of each component in the composition as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">According to one embodiment, when manufacturing fluff, the polymer can be added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount from about 0.01 to about 6 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.

<p id="p-0053" num="0056">According to one embodiment, when manufacturing fluff, the non-ionic surfactant is suitably added to the cellulosic suspension in an amount of from about 70 to about 800, such as from about 80 to about 600, or from about 100 to about 500, or from about 150 to about 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">According to one embodiment, when manufacturing fluff the oil, wax or fat is added in an amount of about 0.001 to about 14 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres, the anionic compound is added in an amount of about 0.001 to about 1.5 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres and the polymer is added in an amount of about 0.01 to about 6 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0060">According to one embodiment, when manufacturing tissue, the anionic compound can be added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount from about 0.001 to about 1 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres. According to one embodiment, when manufacturing tissue, the anionic compound can be added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount from about 0.003 to about 0.4 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres. According to one embodiment, when manufacturing tissue, the anionic compound can be added to a cellulosic suspension in an amount from about 0.004 to about 0.2 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">According to one embodiment, when manufacturing tissue, the non-ionic surfactant is suitably added to the cellulosic suspension in an amount of from about 70 to about 800, such as from about 80 to about 600, or from about 100 to about 500, or from about 150 to about 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">To evaluate the performance of the debonder, burst strength, defiberization energy and wetting rate can be measured. Low burst strength and low defiberization energy shows that the fibre-to-fibre bonds are weak, which in turn facilitates the production of tissue with enhanced softness. The wetting rate indicates that the finished product will have good absorption properties.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">Also, when fluff is used in air-laid applications, it is important to minimise the number of knots. The knots can be described as clusters of fibres. A high number of knots can lead to poor formation and runnability in the air-laid process.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">When the composition is applied to either a wet or dry paper web, the surface feel can be improved. Surface feel can be described as those surface properties which are tactile sensations perceived by the consumer. Surface feel can be evaluated by people in panel tests. Examples of such properties are softness, slipperiness and smoothness. According to one embodiment, the composition is added to the sheet as one single addition. According to another embodiment, the polymer can be added to the cellulosic suspension prior to the formation of the web, whereas the oil, fat or wax; the anionic compound; and the non-ionic surfactant are added to the wet or dry paper web.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">The invention also relates to a process for production of paper comprising applying the composition as described herein to a wet paper web. When the composition is used as a softener in the papermaking process, the composition is usually sprayed onto the wet paper web after the press section but before the Yankee cylinder. By using the composition as a softener, it is possible to obtain a paper with a high surface softness with minimal decrease in strength.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">According to one embodiment, when the composition is used as a softener in the manufacturing of tissue paper, the composition is usually added in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 10, preferably from about 0.3 to about 4 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">The invention also relates to a process for production of paper comprising applying the composition as described herein to a dry paper web.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">When the composition is used as a lotion in the above process, it is usually either sprayed or printed on a dry paper web. This is usually done in the converting process in which the final tissue product is formed. The lotion is suitably present as drops on the paper web surface and is not bonded to the fibres in the same way as a softener. The lotion modifies the surface properties of the tissue, but the lotion is also added for cosmetic reasons since the lotion can be released from the paper and transported to the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">According to one embodiment, the dry paper web has a dry content of at least about 50, such as at least about 65, or at least about 80 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">According to one embodiment, when the composition is used as a lotion for manufacturing tissue, the composition is usually added in the amount of from about 0.1 to about 70, such as from about 5 to about 50 kg/ton dry cellulosic fibres.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The cellulosic fibres utilized by the present invention will normally include fibres derived from wood pulp, which includes chemical pulp such as Kraft, sulphite and sulphate pulps, as well as mechanical pulps such as ground wood, thermomechanical pulp and chemical modified thermomechanical pulp. Recycled fibres may also be used. The recycled fibres can contain all the above mentioned pulps in addition to fillers, printing inks etc. Chemical pulps, however, are preferred since they impart a superior tactile of softness to tissue sheets made from it. The utilization of recycled fibres for making tissue often includes a process step known as deinking to remove as much as possible of the printing ink from the fibre slurry and most of the filler material to get an acceptable brightness and paper machine runnability of the recycled fibre slurry. The deinking process often includes addition of anionic substances such as saponified fatty acids and water glass to the fibre slurry. These substances are sometimes carried over to the paper machine and since these substances are anionic they can inactivate cationic chemicals added to the stock. These substances are called anionic detrimental substances or &#x201c;anionic trash&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">According to one embodiment, further components may be added to the cellulosic suspension used to make tissue or fluff. Such additives can for example be wet strength agents, dry strength agents, and wetting agents as well as other components usually used in the production process. According to one embodiment, an additional polymer being either cationic, non-ionic or amphoteric, can be added to the cellulosic suspension. Suitably the polymer is either a natural polymer, for example starch, or a synthetic polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">According to one embodiment, an anionic polymer is added to the cellulosic suspension, such anionic polymers can include anionic step-growth polymers, chain-growth polymers, polysaccharides, naturally occurring aromatic polymers and modifications thereof.</p>
