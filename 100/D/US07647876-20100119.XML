<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to automated sewing equipment, and in particular to a tape edge workstation for sewing a tape edge material about the outer peripheral edges of a mattress, foundation, or other articles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, in the finishing of bedding components such as mattresses, the bedding materials will be placed on a buildup table, which will support the bedding at a desired height, depending on the thickness or size of the bedding, for finishing sets, including the application of a tape edge along the borders of the upper and lower borders of the bedding. The application of the tape edge typically will be accomplished by a tape edge applicator or sewing head that generally is mounted adjacent the buildup table and is moved around the border or periphery of the bedding for applying the tape edge thereto. A problem that exists, however, is that at the corners of the bedding, especially where there is an offset, such as with pillow top mattresses, the sewing machine typically must be moved away from the bedding and turned so as to sew around each corner of the bedding. Such an operation generally requires considerable manual manipulation of the sewing head by an operator and results in a slow down in the process of applying the tape edge as the operator must slow production to move the tape edge machine and/or to move/adjust the bedding to continue to sew around the corners of the bedding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it can be seen that a need exists for a system and method for applying a tape edge to bedding components such as mattresses and foundation sets, which addresses the foregoing and other related and unrelated problems in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Briefly described, the present invention generally relates to a system or workstation for applying a tape edge material about the peripheral side edges of bedding components such as mattresses or foundation sets. The tape edge applicator workstation, generally includes a conveyor having a conveyor belt on which the bedding component is moved and rotated for application of the tape edge material along the matched, peripheral side edges thereof. The conveyor belt generally is an elongated belt of a size or length sufficient to provide a slack portion to the conveyor belt for enabling ease of removal and replacement of the conveyor belt on the frame of the tape edge workstation as needed. One or more take-up rolls generally are provided below the upper surface of the conveyor and are moveable into engagement with the slack portion of the conveyor belt. Actuators, such as pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, drive motors or other type actuators, move the one or more take up rolls between raised, retracted positions out of engagement with the conveyor belt, and lowered, extended positions in engagement with the conveyor belt so as to make the conveyor belt taut to take-up and remove the slack portion therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A tape edge applicator is provided along one side edge of the conveyor in a position for engaging and applying the tape edge material to an upper side edge of the bedding component as the component passes thereby. The tape edge applicator generally includes a sewing head pivotally mounted on a carriage or support and a supply reel of a tape edge material that is fed into a position overlying the side edge of the bedding component for sewing thereabout as the bedding component passes through the tape edge applicator. The sewing head of the tape edge applicator can be tilted or pivoted with respect to the side edges of the bedding component and further can be raised or lowered to position the sewing head at a desired height and/or orientation as needed for application of the tape edge material to the side edges of the bedding component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the bedding component is moved through the tape edge applicator by the forward movement of the conveyor belt, a leading corner or side of the bedding component tends to engage and bear against a pivoting guide arm that is progressively longitudinally moved along a turning arm positioned adjacent the conveyor belt. As the trailing corner of the bedding component is detected approaching the sewing needle of the tape edge applicator, the system control will actuate the turning arm. As the turning arm is rotated across the conveyor belt, the bedding component is likewise caused to rotate or turn about the sewing needle of the tape edge applicator as the tape edge applicator continues to sew around the corner of the bedding component. The bedding component is rotated approximately 90&#xb0; or until a next edge to be sewn of the bedding component is presented and aligned with the sewing head of the tape edge applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A flipping mechanism is provided at the upstream or downstream end of the conveyor for rotating or flipping the bedding component. The flipping mechanism generally includes a flipper bar that is vertically extensible and is positioned to be engaged by the bedding component as the conveyor moves the bedding component off the worktable. As a result, the leading end of the mattress is lifted upwardly as the trailing end of the mattress is moved forwardly by the conveyor, causing the mattress to flip over onto its previously sewn side edges. Thereafter, the conveyor can be reversed to move the bedding component to an initial sewing position downstream from the tape edge applicator. In addition, an adjustment pad can be actuated to urge the bedding component toward the tape edge applicator to help reposition the bedding component.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like parts throughout the separate views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4C</figref> generally illustrate an automated system or workstation <b>10</b> according to the present invention, for applying a tape edge material T around the peripheral side edges E of a mattress M, foundation, or other bedding or furniture component. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the tape edge workstation <b>10</b> of the present invention generally will include an elongated worktable <b>11</b> having a support frame <b>12</b>, with a conveyor <b>13</b> mounted thereon and including a conveyor belt <b>14</b> that extends over and is moveable along an upper surface <b>16</b> of the worktable <b>11</b> to transport the mattress M along a sewing path, indicated by arrows <b>17</b>, through a tape edge applicator <b>18</b> for application of the tape edge material T along the sides E thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the conveyor belt <b>14</b> generally is formed as an elongated, substantially flat belt having a smooth upper surface <b>19</b>, which can have a tacky finish to prevent slippage or undue movement of the mattress M thereon. A &#x201c;v-belt&#x201d; or similar drive belt <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be attached along a center portion of the conveyor belt on the underside surface <b>22</b> of the conveyor belt <b>14</b>. It will be understood that while only a single v-belt is disclosed as being used in the present embodiment, multiple v-belts or other drive belts also can be used as needed for driving and guiding the conveyor belt <b>14</b> about the frame of the workstation <b>10</b>. The v-belt engages elongated drive shafts <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> of a conveyor drive system <b>13</b> that are positioned at the upstream and downstream edges <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> of the worktable. The conveyor drive system <b>13</b> also includes a drive motor <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that drives at least one of the drive shafts (i.e., downstream shaft <b>24</b>) so as to move or drive the conveyor belt <b>14</b> along its path of travel <b>17</b> to move the mattress M through the tape edge applicator. The conveyor drive motor further generally is a variable speed, reversible servo-motor or other similar type of motor, which is controlled by a system control <b>35</b> for the workstation <b>10</b> so as to drive the conveyor belt forwardly and rearwardly as needed to move the mattress M along its path of travel into and through the tape edge applicator workstation <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system control <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) of the tape edge applicator workstation <b>10</b> generally includes a programmable control processor (not shown) and an operator interface <b>36</b>, such as a touch screen monitor, keypad or other input system or device through which the system control can be programmed to run various sizes and types of bedding components, including foundations or mattresses in twin, double, queen, king or various other sizes. The operator interface generally is mounted adjacent the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and also provides feedback and displays sewing/status indicator or warnings to the operator. The system control <b>35</b> further can comprise a serial bus control system such as embodied in U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,487, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The system control generally monitors and controls the operation of various operative assemblies or components of the workstation <b>10</b>, including the conveyor mechanism <b>13</b>, tape edge applicator <b>18</b>, a downstream turning mechanism <b>65</b> and a flipping mechanism <b>95</b> adjacent the downstream end of the worktable. Such operative assemblies can be constructed as individual or separate modules that can be linked or otherwise connected together in series and mounted together on the unitary workstation frame <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the conveyor belt <b>14</b> generally extends along the upper surface <b>16</b> of the worktable <b>11</b> between the upstream and downstream drive shafts <b>23</b>/<b>24</b>, with the upper surface <b>16</b> of the conveyor belt on which the mattress is being supported during a tape edge application being substantially flat and taut in operation. The conveyor belt <b>14</b> is, however, of a length greater than the length of the worktable, generally having a length sufficient to provide a slack portion that hangs or extends downwardly from the upper portion thereof (as indicated by &#x201c;S&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The slack portion of the conveyor belt <b>14</b> typically is taken up and the conveyor belt tightened or made taut by engagement of the conveyor belt by one or more take-up or idler rolls <b>41</b> mounted on a pivoting arms <b>42</b> positioned below the upper surface <b>16</b> of the worktable <b>11</b>. The arms <b>42</b> are pivotally attached to the frame <b>12</b> of the worktable and are moved between raised and lowered positions by actuators <b>43</b> such as pneumatic or hydraulic take-up cylinders. The actuators <b>43</b> move the take-up rolls upwardly out of contact with the conveyor belt and downwardly into pressing engagement with the conveyor belt <b>14</b>, as shown by arrows <b>44</b> and <b>44</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The take-up cylinders <b>43</b> generally are controlled by the system control <b>35</b> for the tape edge applicator work station of the present invention so as to apply sufficient pressure to stretch the conveyor belt and to take-up or remove any slack from the conveyor belt, without placing undue stress or pressure on the conveyor belt that might cause de-lamination or separation of the ends of the conveyor belt. For example, sensors can be used to detect and provide feedback to the system control, such as an increase in resistance pressure in the actuators <b>43</b> as the conveyor belt is tightened, to allow the actuators to be locked to fix the take-up rolls <b>41</b> in place once the slack portion S has been taken up from the conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By providing the slack portion S in the conveyor belt <b>14</b>, the conveyor belt can be quickly and easily changed-out and loaded on the frame and drive shafts <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> of the conveyor drive system <b>13</b>. An operator can simply move the take-up rolls <b>41</b> to their raised, retracted positions, out of engagement with the conveyor belt to provide the slack and enable the conveyor belt to be removed from the drive shafts. Thereafter, a new conveyor belt can be slid onto the drive shafts, with its slack portion S hanging below the table surface and take-up rolls. The take-up rolls are then pivoted downwardly in the direction of arrows <b>44</b> and <b>44</b>&#x2032;, into their engaging positions to automatically remove the slack from the conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, air jets <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be provided along the frame <b>12</b> of the table <b>11</b> adjacent the upstream and downstream ends <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> of the table, or alternatively, adjacent the take-up rolls <b>41</b>. The air jets can be periodically actuated by the system control to apply pressurized blasts of air against or along the underside surface <b>22</b> of the conveyor belt <b>14</b> to dislodge and prevent the undue buildup of lint and debris from collecting along the underside surface of the conveyor belt. Additionally, although not shown, the sides of the frame of the worktable can be enclosed with a grill or by perforated doors to conceal and protect the conveyor belt and take up rolls from unauthorized access, while enabling escape of the lint, dust, and other debris being dislodged from the conveyor belt by the air jets. The doors or grill further can be opened to enable an operator access as needed, such as to sweep out or otherwise clean off excess debris, dust, and lint from the underside of the conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the worktable frame <b>12</b> and conveyor belt <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the present invention are designed such that the upper surface <b>16</b> of the worktable over which the upper portion of the conveyor belt is moved is supported via cantilevered supports <b>47</b> extending from the operator side of the worktable. As a result, the supports or legs of the worktable frame along one side of the conveyor mechanism <b>13</b> can be disengaged with the removal of a few bolts, so as to enable further quick access to the conveyor belt as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the tape edge applicator workstation <b>10</b> of the present invention includes a tape edge applicator <b>18</b>, which typically includes a sewing head <b>50</b> and a support for a supply reel <b>51</b> of the tape edge material T mounted adjacent the operator side of the work table <b>11</b>. The sewing head <b>50</b> of the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> can be mounted on a pivotable support bracket <b>52</b> that enables the sewing head <b>50</b> to pivot or tilt with respect to the side edges E of the mattress M being sewn. The support bracket <b>52</b> further is mounted on a vertically moveable support or platform <b>53</b> for raising and lowering the sewing head in the direction of arrows <b>54</b> and <b>54</b>&#x2032;. The sewing head <b>50</b> typically is a conventional sewing head having one or more sewing needles and a feed mechanism for feeding the tape edge material into a position overlying the matched side edges of the mattress for attaching the tape edge material thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, an operator platform <b>60</b> is provided adjacent the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> for supporting the operator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, foot pedals <b>61</b> can be provided on the operator platform for controlling a sewing operation of the tape edge applicator. Also shown adjacent the tape edge applicator and operator platform <b>60</b> is the operator interface <b>36</b> for the system control <b>35</b> to enable the operator to control or adjust the operation position and/or orientation of the sewing head of the tape edge applicator. For example, the operator can adjust the height and/or tilt of the tape edge applicator with respect to the side edges of the mattress being sewn on the worktable to ensure accurate and efficient sewing of the tape edge material along the side edges. The operator further can adjust the position of the operator platform with respect to both the height of the mattress being sewn and the tape edge applicator itself, moving it in the direction of arrows <b>62</b> and <b>62</b>&#x2032; via the system control <b>35</b>. Such adjustments can be synchronized such that once the operator has determined the proper height of the operator platform and positioned the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> at a desired working height for that particular operator, such height positions or other parameters can be set/programmed into the system control. Thereafter, any adjustments to the height or position of the tape edge applicator automatically will result in corresponding adjustments to the operator platform.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As additionally indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a sensor <b>63</b> is mounted adjacent the conveyor belt and the sewing path <b>17</b> of the mattress, upstream from the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>. The sensor <b>63</b> can be a photocell, proximity sensor or other type of detector that monitors the movement of the mattress M past the tape edge applicator and sends a signal to the system control <b>35</b> as a trailing corner of the mattress passes thereby to signal the approach of the trailing corner to the tape edge applicator. Upon receiving this signal, the system control thereafter can determine, such as based upon a count of the number of stitches going forward, when the trailing corner of the mattress will reach the sewing head of the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>, and can accordingly activate a turning mechanism <b>65</b> for rotating the mattress to present a next side edge of the mattress for application of the tape edge material thereto, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The turning mechanism <b>65</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>4</b>B and includes a turning arm <b>66</b> positioned along the operator side of the tape edge applicator workstation <b>10</b> of the present invention. The turning arm <b>66</b> generally includes an elongated body <b>67</b> that extends substantially along the worktable <b>11</b> from a position adjacent the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> toward the downstream or distal end <b>28</b> of the worktable. The turning arm is mounted on a vertically extending pivot mechanism or support bar <b>68</b>, the lower end of which is connected to the drive shaft of a drive motor <b>69</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), controlled by the system control <b>35</b> for the tape edge applicator workstation. The drive motor causes the turning arm <b>66</b> to be pivoted or rotated across the width of the worktable <b>11</b> in the direction of arrows <b>70</b> and <b>70</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) for rotating the mattress to the next side edge to which a tape edge is to be applied. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the upper end <b>71</b> of the pivot mechanism <b>68</b> is attached to a pivoting support arm <b>72</b>, adjacent a first end <b>73</b> thereof, with the opposite end <b>74</b> of the support arm <b>72</b> being pivotally attached to a stanchion or brace <b>76</b> above the surface of the worktable <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the distal end <b>77</b> of the turning arm <b>66</b> generally will be supported by a cantilevered support rod or cable <b>78</b> that is attached at the first end <b>72</b> of the pivoting support arm <b>73</b>, adjacent the vertically extending support brace of the turning arm. This support rod <b>78</b> supports the distal end <b>77</b> of the turning arm <b>66</b> above the conveyor belt <b>14</b> during rotation of the turning arm to prevent sagging or dragging of the turning arm against the upper surface of the conveyor, which could catch, scratch, or otherwise damage the upper surface of the conveyor belt. In addition, the edges of the conveyor belt further can be sealed within guide plates <b>79</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that extend along the side edges of the conveyor belt to help protect the side edges of the conveyor belt and prevent catching or other damage thereto, such as during rotation of the turning arm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the turning arm <b>66</b> further includes a pivoting guide arm or plate <b>81</b> that is attached to the distal or free end <b>77</b> of the turning arm. The guide arm <b>81</b> can be pivotally mounted on a carriage or bracket <b>82</b> so as to be pivotable as indicated by arrows <b>83</b>/<b>83</b>&#x2032; from a raised, rest, or non-engaging position to a lowered, engaging position extending outwardly from the turning arm and across the worktable and conveyor during the sewing applications so that the forwardly facing side or end of the mattress is engaged thereagainst, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4B</figref>. The guide arm <b>81</b> also is moved longitudinally along the length of the turning arm <b>66</b>, with its carriage <b>82</b> riding along guide tracks <b>84</b> extending along the body of the turning arm during a tape edge application to a desired stopping point once the sewing of the tape edge along the current side edge of the mattress is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present embodiment, as illustrated, in its lowered, engaging position, the pivoting guide arm <b>81</b> extends between six to twelve inches outwardly from the turning arm, such that the corner of the mattress is received and resting between the guide arm and turning arm. It will, however, be understood by those skilled in the art that the pivoting guide arm further can be formed with a greater or lesser length as desired, including being formed of a length that extends substantially across the width of the worktable. Still further, the pivoting guide arm can be formed as a telescoping member that can be extensible across the width of the worktable. A cylinder <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or other, similar actuator typically will be mounted on an upstanding support <b>87</b> adjacent the bracket <b>82</b> and will include an extensible cylinder rod <b>88</b> attached at its distal or free end to the guide plate. The cylinder is controlled by the system control and moves the guide plate between its engaging and non-engaging positions at the end of a sewing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, as shown in the attached drawings, guide rollers <b>91</b> are positioned along the operator side of the worktable <b>11</b> upstream from the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>. These guide rollers <b>91</b> can be adjusted laterally toward and away from the worktable, and typically will be slightly offset from the worktable. As a result, when the mattress M is urged thereagainst, the side edge E of the mattress to be sewn will be presented at a slight angle or offset with respect to the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> to ensure proper feeding the mattress therein for application of the tape edge along its side edge.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As additionally indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B, a support platform <b>92</b> is positioned along the opposite side of the worktable <b>11</b> from the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>. The support platform <b>92</b> projects outwardly from the worktable <b>11</b> to provide an additional support surface for the mattress during a turning operation. An adjustment pad <b>93</b> is mounted within the support platform <b>92</b> and is moveable upwardly and inwardly toward the mattress as indicated by arrows <b>94</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4B</figref>). As the pad <b>93</b> is moved to its raised engaging position, it tends to engage and urge the mattress across the upper surface of the conveyor belt <b>14</b> and against the guide rollers <b>91</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to help position and align the side edges of the mattress for attachment of the tape edge material thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>C, a mattress flipping mechanism <b>95</b> is provided at the downstream end <b>28</b> of the worktable <b>11</b>, although it can be positioned at either end of the worktable as needed. The mattress flipping mechanism <b>95</b> generally includes an extensible flipper bar <b>96</b> that extends substantially across the width of the worktable, and is moved into engaging position by engagement with the lower surface of a mattress M moved thereover by a pivoting support frame <b>97</b>. The pivoting support frame of the mattress flipping mechanism generally is attached to the frame <b>12</b> of the worktable <b>11</b> and is movable from a lowered, non-engaging position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to a raised, engaging position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, by a drive mechanism <b>98</b> such as one or more pneumatic cylinders, drive motors, or other, similar drive. The flipper bar <b>96</b> generally is attached to a pair of extensible control or guide rods <b>99</b> that telescope into and out of the pivoting support frame <b>97</b>. The control rods <b>99</b> for the flipper bar <b>96</b> generally are attached to cylinders <b>101</b> (or can be the cylinder rods of such cylinders) that are mounted to and thus moved with the pivoting support frame, and are actuated by the system control to automatically extend and retract the flipper bar during a turning or flipping operation as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After all four peripheral side edges of an upper or lower surface of the mattress M have had the tape edge material applied thereto, the mattress will be conveyed by the conveyor <b>13</b> to the downstream edge of the worktable, to a flipping position. The flipper bar <b>96</b> then will be engaged and moved upwardly, causing the downstream end of the mattress to likewise be raised, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, as the conveyor continues to move the trailing end of the mattress forwardly. The flipper bar generally is extended upwardly and inwardly toward the upstream edge of the worktable so that the mattress is progressively urged upwardly and caused to flip over onto its previously sewn surface or edges. Thereafter, the mattress can be moved rearwardly by reversal of the conveyor belt, so as to reposition the mattress upstream of the tape edge applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, the side of the mattress can be engaged by a push plate <b>105</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, an <b>4</b>C, to urge the mattress across the conveyor and away from the sewing head as needed to position the mattress for flipping. An actuator such as a cylinder <b>106</b> is attached to the push plate <b>105</b> for moving the push plate laterally across the conveyor as needed to move the mattress toward the center of the conveyor belt and into its flipping position. Thereafter, once the tape edge application has been completed on all the desired mattress or foundation side edges, the mattress can be conveyed off the worktable by the continued forward movement of the conveyor belt for transfer to a downstream packaging operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation of the present invention, the mattress, foundation, or other bedding component generally indicated as M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4A</figref>, is placed on the upper surface <b>19</b> of the conveyor belt <b>14</b>. The mattress M typically is aligned against the guide rollers <b>91</b> and initially is positioned extending partially past the sewing head <b>50</b> of a tape edge applicator <b>18</b> mounted along one side of the conveyor <b>14</b>, at the start of the tape edge application operation. Typically, the application of the tape edge material will begin at an intermediate point, such as the midpoint, along a first side edge of an upwardly facing surface of the mattress or bedding component M. Prior to starting, the operator can adjust the position of the sewing head of the tape edge applicator vertically in the direction of arrows <b>54</b> and <b>54</b>&#x2032;, while at the same time, typically adjusting the position of the operator platform <b>60</b> with respect to the conveyor and mattress according to the operator's preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the tape edge application operation commences, the conveyor <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>) moves the mattress or other bedding component M in the direction of arrows <b>17</b> toward the downstream end of the worktable as the tape edge material is fed into an overlying relationship about the side edge of the mattress and is attached thereto by the sewing head <b>50</b>. As a trailing corner of the mattress approaches the sewing head, a sensor <b>63</b> detects and signals the system control of the approach of the trailing corner toward the sewing needle of the sewing head. In response, as the corner nears the sewing needle, the system control <b>35</b> actuates turning mechanism <b>65</b>, which rotates its turning arm <b>66</b> about pivoting support <b>68</b>, moving in the direction of arrows <b>70</b> across the width of the conveyor belt, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. As a result, the mattress M, with its leading corner is engaged between the guide arm <b>81</b> and body <b>67</b> of the turning arm <b>66</b> is caused to pivot or rotate about the sewing needle as the sewing needle continues to sew the tape edge material about the corner. The speed of the tape edge applicator operation can be slowed or run at a more controlled rate during the turning operation as needed to ensure consistency as the tape edge material is sewn about the corner of the mattress. As the rotation or turning of the mattress is completed, a next side edge to be sewn is presented and aligned along the sewing path <b>17</b> in alignment with the sewing head. Thereafter, the conveyor belt <b>14</b> is reengaged so as to move the mattress forwardly in the direction of arrow <b>17</b> through the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>. The turning process is repeated as the tape edge material is applied about all four side edges and corners of the upwardly facing surface of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the tape edge material has been applied around all the peripheral edges of the upwardly facing surface of the mattress, the tape edge applicator <b>18</b> can be disengaged or deactivated temporarily, while the push plate <b>105</b> moves or urges the mattress toward the center of the conveyor belt. Thereafter, the guide arm <b>81</b> of the turning arm will be automatically folded or pivoted in the direction of arrow <b>83</b>&#x2032; out of the path of the mattress so as to not interfere with the further forward movement of the mattress by the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt then is reengaged and transports the mattress toward the downstream end of the worktable in the direction of arrow <b>17</b> for commencement of the turning or flipping operation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At the downstream end of the worktable, the leading end or side of the mattress is engaged by a flipper bar <b>96</b> of turning mechanism <b>95</b>. As the conveyor <b>13</b> continues to move the trailing end of the mattress forwardly in the direction of arrow <b>17</b>, the flipper bar is raised by its cylinders <b>101</b> so as to cause the leading end of the mattress to be raised upwardly and urged rearwardly. As a result, the mattress is caused to flip or turn over onto its previously sewn surface, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Thereafter, the operation of the conveyor belt <b>14</b> will be reversed so as to move the mattress rearwardly to a position downstream from the tape edge applicator <b>18</b>. At about the same time, an adjustment pad <b>93</b> can be moved into engagement with a side of the mattress, to urge the mattress laterally across the width of the conveyor belt toward the tape edge applicator to help reposition the mattress for application of the tape edge material about the edges of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It further will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes, modifications, and additions can be made to the forgoing invention without departing from the spirit and scope of thereof.</p>
