<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an automatic sewing device particularly for hosiery knitting machines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In circular hosiery knitting machines there is the problem of picking up the hosiery item at the end of knitting in order to take it to the sewing machine which performs its final sewing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The aim of the present invention is to provide a device which is capable of picking up automatically a hosiery item at the end of the forming of its tubular part in order to take it to a sewing station.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the invention is to provide a device which allows to grip the hosiery item at its tip in a manner which is simple, safe and reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another object of the invention is to provide a device which is capable of operating even with high-gauge hosiery, up to and beyond 200 needles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object is to provide a device which allows to provide a flat and traditional stitched seam on the inside of the hosiery item.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by an automatic sewing device, particularly for hosiery knitting machines, characterized in that it comprises a supporting arm for an oscillating means, which comprises at least one first oscillating assembly, constituted by a semicircular ring, and at least one second oscillating assembly, constituted by a second semicircular ring, a means for actuating the oscillating assemblies which is adapted to produce at least one open position, in which the oscillating assemblies substantially form a ring which has the same size as the needle cylinder from which it picks up a hosiery item at the end of the knitting process, and at least one closed position, in which the oscillating assemblies close the hosiery item in a semicircular arrangement, ready to be sewn, in a sewing station, the support being movable from at least one position for gripping the hosiery item from the needle cylinder to at least one position for applying the hosiery item to the sewing station.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, after the oscillating assemblies have closed the hosiery item in a semicircular configuration, the item is transferred to a hosiery supporting assembly, constituted by two half-rings which allow to change the grip from the selvage to the inside of the hosiery item in the row that directly precedes the rows where the sewing will be performed, in order to be subsequently moved toward the sewing station.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to the cited figures, the device according to the invention, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>1</b>, comprises a supporting arm, which is constituted by a fork <b>2</b>, the prongs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of which end with respective hinges <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, to which a first oscillating assembly <b>7</b> is pivoted. The oscillating assembly is constituted by a semicircular ring connected, when the device is in the open position, to a second oscillating assembly <b>8</b>, constituted by a semicircular ring which is rigidly coupled to the prongs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of the fork <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fork <b>2</b> comprises a coupling <b>9</b> for a supporting member, not shown in the figures, with respect to which the device rotates and can move vertically from at least one position for gripping a selvage to at least one position for applying the selvage to a sewing station <b>50</b>, preferably by means of an intermediate passage during which the hosiery item is clamped inside the selvage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The two oscillating assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are actuated by an actuation means, which is constituted by two pneumatic cylinders, designated by the reference numerals <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> respectively, which are rigidly coupled to the respective prongs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of the fork <b>2</b> and each have a stem <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> which is pivoted to a bar <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, each of which is rigidly coupled to one of the two oscillating assemblies, in the specific case the first oscillating assembly <b>7</b> and the second assembly <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Both assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> comprise a blade means, which is constituted by a set of fixed blades <b>17</b> and a set of moving blades <b>18</b>, which have at least one open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and at least one closed position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The open position of the moving blades <b>18</b> is determined by the presence of an elastic means, which is constituted by springs <b>19</b> which act in contrast with a pneumatic actuator <b>20</b>, which closes the blades when it is active or opens them, by the thrust of the springs <b>19</b>, when it is not active.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pneumatic actuators <b>20</b> of the blades are supplied by connectors <b>21</b>, which are external to the first oscillating assembly and are connected to supply hoses <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The blades <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are arranged so as to accommodate between them the needles <b>23</b> of a cylinder of a hosiery knitting machine, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>24</b>. The hosiery knitting machine can be of the per se known type and is not described here for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As is known, at the end of the knitting of the hosiery item, the selvage, designated by the reference numeral <b>25</b>, is located at the upper end of the needle cylinder and must be picked up in order to be taken to the sewing station.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The needles of the cylinder, selected one by one, are lifted, raising the last row of knitting of the selvage above the sinkers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the invention, at this point the device <b>1</b> intervenes and places itself above the needle cylinder, with the oscillating assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> in the open position and forming a ring which has the same size as the needle cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The ring constituted by the oscillating assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> then moves downward, with the blades at the height of the last row of knitting of the selvage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At this point, the blades <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> move radially toward the inside of the axis of the cylinder, because they are divided into sectors with multiple teeth each, and the fixed and moving blades slide simultaneously so as to have at least one position on the outside of the diameter where there are needles and at least one position inside the diameter where there are needles.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once the selvage has been taken from the needle cylinder, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the device is moved away from the needle cylinder and, before reaching the sewing station <b>50</b>, the pneumatic cylinders <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are actuated, closing the oscillating assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, which accordingly have the selvage closed in a semicircle, ready to be transferred to a hosiery supporting assembly, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The hosiery supporting assembly <b>10</b> is constituted by a rotating arm <b>26</b>, which supports an inverted fork <b>27</b>, to which a shaft is applied which in turn supports two semicircular rings <b>28</b> and <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The semicircular rings <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> support the selvage in the transfer from the oscillating assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to the sewing station <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In practice it has been found that the invention achieves the intended aim and objects, a device having been provided which is capable of picking up a hosiery item at the end of its knitting in the needle cylinder and of supplying the selvage to the sewing station in a fully automatic manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An advantage of the invention also resides in that the device also allows to pick up men's socks with a high gauge, up to and above 200 needles, assuredly and reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The device also allows to perform flat and traditional sewing on the inside of the hosiery item.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The device according to the invention is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, within the scope of the appended claims. All the details may be replaced with technically equivalent elements.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The materials used, as well as the dimensions, may of course be any according to the requirements and the state of the art.</p>
