The creaser accessory device includes first and second plates having a proximal end and a distal end, with each of the first and second plates having inner generally planar mating surfaces adjacent to each other. A lever arm is pivotally connected to each of the first and second plates and pivotally connects the first and second plates together. The first and second plates are configured to be moved by the lever arm between an open configuration and a closed configuration, the distal ends of the first and second plates being spaced apart in the open configuration a sufficient distance to allow a portion of the garment to be received therebetween, and the distal ends of the first and second plates in the closed configuration being moved toward each other such that the inner generally planar mating surfaces of the first and second plates are operative to press the portion of the garment received therebetween to form a crease in the portion of the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred aspect, the lever arm is configured to be operated by a user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates away from each other to receive the portion of the garment therebetween. The lever arm is also preferably configured to be operated by a user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates together to press the portion of the garment to form a crease in the portion of the garment received therebetween, and to be operated by the user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates apart to release the portion of the garment once the portion of the garment has been pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a presently preferred aspect, the first and second plates each have a plurality of apertures therethrough to allow steam from a hand held steam generating device coupled to the creaser accessory device to pass through the apertures to heat the portion of the garment received between the first and second plates. The creaser accessory device is typically configured to be removably coupled to such a hand held steam generating device for generating steam to pass through the apertures of the first and second plates for delivering steam heat to the portion of the garment received between the first and second plates.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another preferred aspect, the creaser accessory device includes a tab member extending from the distal end of one of the first and second plates, and a slotted member at the proximal end of the one of the first and second plates, for removably connecting the creaser accessory device to a corresponding coupling mechanism of the hand held steam generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the operation of the invention.</p>

The lever arm can be operated by a user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates away from each other to receive the portion of the garment therebetween. The lever arm can then be operated by a user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates together to press the portion of the garment to form a crease in the portion of the garment, and the lever arm can then be operated by the user to pivot the distal ends of the first and second plates apart to release the portion of the garment once the portion of the garment has been pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hand held steamer typically includes a plastic housing, with a main body <b>42</b> having a proximal end <b>44</b> and a distal end <b>46</b>, and a handle <b>48</b> attached to the proximal end of the main body, and an electrical power cord <b>50</b> connected to the handle. The housing includes an electrical steam generating heater (not shown) configured to receive electrical power from the electrical cord. The heater typically includes a refillable reservoir (not shown), a manually operated pump operated by pushing a button <b>52</b> for drawing water from the reservoir and injecting the water into the heater to generate steam. Steam emitting ports (not shown) along an exterior steam emitting face <b>54</b> of the main body, extending between the proximal and distal ends of the main body. The exterior steam emitting face of the main body includes a coupling apparatus (not shown) for removably receiving an accessory, such as a brush, and in particular for removably receiving the creaser accessory device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coupling apparatus on the main body of the steamer typically includes a slot (not shown) at the distal end of the exterior steam emitting face of the main body for receiving a corresponding tab member <b>56</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) extending from the distal end of the creaser accessory device, and a sliding tab <b>58</b> slidable between a distally directed position and a proximally directed position, the sliding tab being configured to engage a corresponding slot <b>60</b> of a slotted member <b>62</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the accessory in the distally directed position, the sliding tab being configured to disengage the accessory in the proximally directed position, and the sliding tab being biased toward the distally directed position engaging the corresponding slot of the creaser accessory.</p>
