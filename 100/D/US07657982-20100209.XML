<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of PCT application PCT/EP2004/052809, filed 4 Nov. 2004, published 30 Jun. 2005 as WO2005/059217, and claiming the priority of German patent application 10359916.9 itself filed 18 Dec. 2003 and German patent application 102004030918.3 itself filed 25 Jun. 2004, whose entire disclosures are herewith incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention pertains to a suction device for liquids, in particular, in hydroentangling machines in which more than one water bar for generating jets of liquid are provided and the suction device consists of a suction tube with one or more axially extending suction openings for each water bar that extend over the working length of the tube. The liquid is sucked from the respective water bar through the respective suction opening as a result of negative pressure in the tube. A device of this type is known from EP-A-1 059 377 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,412,140) or WO 01/79598 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,957,474).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common practice to provide several water bars in an entangling drum with internally arranged suction tube, a suction slot in the suction tube that may also consist of several suction openings each being aligned with a respective water bar. The suction tube is subjected to a negative pressure in order to carry off the sprayed-on liquid. The negative pressure acts upon all suction slots of the suction tube. This means that a suction slot whose respective water bar is switched off, is also subjected to the negative pressure. This leads to avoidable pressure losses.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention aims to develop a device that makes it possible to prevent the energy losses caused by existing water bars while they are switched off.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on a device of the above-cited type, this objective is attained in that the suction openings extending over the entire working width are configured such that they can be sealed relative to the respectively allocated water bar. The sealing mechanism can be realized in different ways.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The suction device consists of a rotatably supported drum <b>1</b> that is permeable to liquids. The material <b>2</b> to be entangled lies on this drum <b>1</b>. Only one water bar <b>3</b> is arranged above the drum <b>1</b>. Water jets <b>4</b> are ejected from said water bar <b>3</b> under high pressure and impinge on the material <b>2</b>. Several such water bars <b>3</b> could be arranged around the drum <b>1</b>. The sprayed-on water needs to be removed by suction immediately thereafter underneath the material <b>2</b>. For this purpose, a suction tube <b>5</b> is stationarily supported centrally within the drum <b>1</b>. The wall of this suction tube is formed with suction bores <b>6</b> that are aligned in a row along an axis of the water bar <b>3</b>. Sliding strips <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> for determining the width of the suction slot <b>9</b> are stationarily arranged radially outside the tube <b>5</b> parallel to the axis on the left side as well as the right side of these bores <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The suction slot <b>9</b> should be realized such that it can be quickly sealed. The solution according to above-cited EP-A-1 059 377 features an exchangeable cleaning strip <b>9</b>&#x2032; according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, in which the suction openings are formed about centrally. In this case, the suction slot can be sealed by attaching a strip that lacks the suction openings, i.e., a massive shoe. However, this seal can only be produced while the machine is at a standstill.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a suction tube <b>5</b> whose suction openings <b>6</b> can be covered by a laterally displaceable shutter <b>10</b> arranged on the inner side of the tube <b>5</b>. This shutter <b>10</b> is detachably held on the suction tube <b>5</b> by means of a bearing arrangement <b>11</b>. The shutter <b>10</b> is supported for pivoting by a plurality of articulated arms <b>12</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> such that the shutter <b>10</b> is moved toward the supporting block <b>11</b> on the other side of the suction slot <b>6</b> when the articulated arms <b>12</b> are pivoted. This means that the suction slot <b>6</b> is sealed by the shutter <b>10</b>. The actuation of the shutter movement is achieved with a pressure cylinder <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the solution according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bearing arrangement <b>11</b> supports a shutter <b>10</b> that can also be pivoted upward in the direction of the double arrow <b>14</b> and seals the suction slot <b>6</b> with a mating profile <b>11</b>. The actuation of the shutter <b>10</b> can be realized with a pressure hose <b>15</b> that is held in the bearing arrangement <b>11</b> over the length of the suction slot <b>5</b>. When this pressure hose is filled with compressed air, it expands and moves the shutter <b>10</b> upward with the free end in order to seal the suction slot <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a simpler solution that is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, merely a longitudinal shutter <b>16</b> is provided on the inner side of the suction tube such that it can be moved upward in order to seal the opening <b>6</b> by means of a not-shown mechanism. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>shows a hose <b>17</b> that can be pressurized and is longitudinally arranged on one side of the slot <b>6</b>. This hose is moved against a supporting wall <b>18</b> on the other side of the slot <b>6</b> after it is inflated with compressed air. However, a suction slot may also be sealed by coaxially arranging a sealing tube <b>19</b> on the inner side of the suction tube <b>5</b> such that it can be turned relative to the suction tube <b>5</b>. The sealing tube <b>19</b> is formed with through-openings <b>6</b> that correspond to the arrangement of the suction slots <b>6</b> and cover the corresponding suction slot <b>6</b> after being turned accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show optional solutions that are arranged in the lateral walls <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> of the suction slot <b>9</b>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a recess <b>20</b> for accommodating a pivoting mechanism is arranged in one of the walls <b>8</b>. If applicable, this lever <b>21</b> is realized in a conical fashion and supported along the suction slot. This lever can be pivoted along the axis of the suction slot. This can be achieved with the axially inner axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>or the axially outer axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>. The pivoting movement could be achieved electrically, but it would also be conceivable to realize other operating modes.</p>
