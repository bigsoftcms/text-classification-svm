<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A web of tissue is formed in a twin wire former, followed by an air press for water removal in the pressing section, passing onto a Yankee dryer. A headbox injects stock between upper and lower dryer fabrics brought together on a breast roll. The fabrics moves over vacuum boxes, and the web is heated with steam and passed between an upper pressure box and a lower vacuum box forming an air press which dewaters the web. A sheet transfer pickup vacuum box holds the sheet to the upper fabric as the lower fabric diverges from the upper fabric. A pressure roller transfers the web onto a Yankee dryer. The fabrics are cleaned on vertical runs before returning to the breast roll. A final forming fabric is arranged to operated at a lower speed than the penultimate forming fabric so that a rush transfer and creping like action takes place.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to papermaking machines used in forming tissue grades of paper in general and to machines employing crescent formers and twin wire formers in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tissue is a lightweight grade of paper which is formed, pressed and dried on a single large dryer called a Yankee dryer. The tissue is creped from the surface of the Yankee dryer by a doctor blade creating a soft absorbent tissue. Tissue is widely used in products such as toilet paper, paper towel, napkins, and facial tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical tissue forming machine consists of a fourdrinier former which transfers the web to a press felt which conducts the tissue web through a pressing section. Following the pressing section the web is pressed against a Yankee dryer roll to firmly adhere the web to the surface of the roll. The transfer roll may have a nip loading of approximately 200 pounds per linear inch and sometimes various sprays are used to increase adherence to the surface of the Yankee dryer roll. The tissue web is rapidly dried on the surface of the Yankee dryer which may have a diameter of over 22 feet. The dried web is scraped off the surface of the dryer by a doctor blade in a process known as creping which increases the bulk and absorbency of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When attempting to modernize a typical older tissue making machine, the forming section, which has limited water handling capacity, which impacts formation potential, and needs substantial upkeep due to age, is advantageously replaced with a modern twin wire former or crescent former. Updating the pressing section, however, presents problems: modern fabrics are stiff and cannot be bunched up and threaded through the threading openings on older machines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The existing pressing section typically cannot sufficiently reduce the water content of the higher speed web produced by the new crescent or twin-wire former. Because drying capability is limited by the maximum size and temperature of the Yankee dryer, if the performance of older machines is to be increased without increased drying capability, a solution which improves the capacity of the pressing section must be found. At the same time, it is necessary to eliminate the long spans where the web is supported by a felt, which have the potential for sheet drop-offs and hole formation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed is a combination of tissue forming section and press section which can be used to improve the performance of existing tissue making machines.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The papermaking machine of this invention forms a web of tissue in a crescent former, followed by an air press for water removal in the pressing section. The web is then pressed onto a Yankee dryer for drying. The crescent former employs a breast roll around which a upper fabric and a lower fabric are brought together. A headbox injects a stream of stock between the two fabrics as they are brought together on the breast roll. The upper fabric engages the breast roll first, and water is driven off through the lower fabric due to centrifugal acceleration as the wires move together around the breast roll. The two forming fabrics move together over a series of vacuum</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">boxes, and the sheet is heated with steam and passed between an upper pressure box and a lower vacuum box forming an air press which dewaters the web by forcing air through the web. A sheet transfer pickup vacuum box holds the sheet to the upper fabric as the lower fabric diverges away from the upper fabric. A pressure roller transfers the web onto the surface of a Yankee dryer. A tail cutter is located between the sheet transfer
<br/>
box and the pressure roller. Each of the fabrics has a vertical run of fabric before it returns to the breast roll. The vertical runs allow the forming fabrics to be cleaned while baffles prevent the cleaned fabric from being sprayed.
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various modifications can be made to the basic design. A second upper fabric or transfer fabric operating at a lower speed then the first upper fabric can be used to form a rush transfer between the forming fabrics and the Yankee dryer which increases web bulk and absorbency. Instead of a second fabric, a vacuum pressure roll may perform the rush transfer between the lower forming fabric and the Yankee dryer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lower fabric may be divided into two fabrics, and the second fabric which passes through the air press, can be used to mold a texture into the web.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rush transfer and the molding fabric may be combined in one machine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A twin wire former may be used instead of a crescent former in each of the above configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a feature of the present invention to provide a replacement forming and pressing section to an existing papermaking machine for forming tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is another feature of the present invention to provide a pressing section of shorter length.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is a further feature of the present invention to provide for cleaning forming fabrics as they move upwardly along a vertical path.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further feature of the present invention to increase the speed at which a tissue forming papermaking machine operates.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is yet another feature of the present invention to provide means for integrating an air press into a papermaking machine for forming tissue grades of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A yet further feature of the present invention is to provide an improved tissue former which utilizes portions of an existing machine and thus reduces costs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> wherein like numbers refer to similar parts, a papermaking machine <b>20</b> for forming tissue grades of paper is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The apparatus <b>20</b> has a headbox <b>22</b> which is positioned over a breast roll <b>24</b> to inject a stream of stock into a nip <b>34</b> formed between an upper forming fabric <b>26</b> and a lower forming fabric <b>28</b>. The upper forming fabric <b>26</b> forms an endless loop which contains the breast roll <b>24</b> and a pressure roll <b>30</b> which presses the upper forming fabric <b>26</b> against a Yankee dryer <b>32</b>. The nip <b>34</b> is formed where the lower forming fabric <b>28</b> is wrapped onto the upper forming fabric <b>26</b> as it wraps around the breast roll <b>24</b>. A tissue web <b>36</b> is formed as water is removed from the stock by suction into the breast roll <b>24</b> and by the action of centrifugal force which causes water to be thrown outwardly where curved baffles <b>38</b> direct it into a saveall <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The upper fabric <b>26</b> and lower fabric <b>28</b> with the web <b>36</b> sandwiched therebetween passes over a series of vacuum boxes <b>42</b> which further dewater the web <b>36</b>. The web is then heated by a steam shower <b>44</b> positioned over a vacuum box <b>46</b>. Heating the web reduces the viscosity of the water contained in the web. The web <b>36</b> sandwiched between the upper fabric <b>26</b> and the lower fabric <b>28</b> then passes through an air press <b>48</b> consisting of an upper pressure box <b>50</b> and a lower vacuum box <b>52</b>. The air press <b>48</b>, which is described more fully in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/962,110, filed Oct. 31, 1997, entitled Air Pressing Equipment and Processes, which is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,042 Eaton et al. which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a apparatus for dewatering a web formed by a twin wire former. Eaton et al. describes pressure dome on one side of a sandwich of two forming fabrics and a web held therebetween and a opposed curved vacuum box which receives water from the web. Eaton et al. uses the terminology pressure dome and water collecting chamber to refer to the disclosed air press. Such terminology is analogous to the terminology used herein of a pressure box opposed to a vacuum box.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The air press <b>48</b> is positioned about the upper forming fabric <b>26</b> and the lower forming fabric <b>28</b> and the web <b>36</b> is positioned therebetween. Air is supplied to the pressure box <b>50</b> and flows through the relatively permeable upper forming fabric <b>26</b>, through the web <b>36</b>, and finally through the relatively permeable lower forming fabric <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The large area of the pressure box <b>50</b>, which may be six inches wide in the machine direction, as compared to a jet of air, means that air flows with relatively low velocity through the web and applies a relatively high pressure of about fifteen to thirty psi to the web <b>36</b> as it passes between the pressure box <b>50</b> and the vacuum box <b>52</b>. Pressure in the vacuum box <b>52</b> is typically about fifteen inches of Mercury below atmospheric or about seven psi vacuum. Thus the total pressure drop across the web <b>36</b> is approximately twenty to thirty-five psi and almost all the pressure drop occurs through the web <b>36</b> thickness. The web <b>36</b> is relatively thin, approximately a few hundredths of an inch or less, as air moves through the web it sees the twenty to thirty-five psi pressure drop, by dividing pressure drop by the thickness of the web, a value for the pressure gradient across the web can be calculated, demonstrating the large pressure gradient through the web.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The effect of the rapid expansion of air as it passes through the web <b>36</b> is to remove water from the web. As described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/962,110, an air press device used on a tissue web having a solids content of about twenty-five percent and a thickness of about three hundredths of an inch was able to increase the solids content to approximately thirty-three percent. Although the precise mechanism is not clearly understood, the use of pressurized air is more effective than vacuum alone because of the higher pressures available and the greater air volume forced through the web. The upper fabric <b>26</b> and the lower fabric <b>28</b> are substantially more permeable then the web so that almost all the pressure drop occurs across the web <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The mechanism of the air press <b>48</b> is distinct from a system using jets of air directed at a web. A jet of air is difficult to maintain with uniformly along the machine direction. Further the magnitude of the dynamic pressure differential which can be developed is generally lower than the static air press pressure developed in the enclosed air press frame <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Following the air press <b>48</b>, the lower fabric <b>28</b> is directed away from the upper fabric <b>26</b> and a sheet transfer pickup box <b>54</b> draws a vacuum on the upper fabric <b>26</b> to cause the web <b>36</b> to follow the upper forming fabric <b>26</b>. The web <b>36</b> then travels around a pressure roller <b>30</b> which presses against the Yankee dryer <b>32</b> with a pressure of approximately two hundred pounds per linear inch and transfers the web <b>36</b> to the surface of the Yankee dryer <b>32</b>. A tail cutter <b>60</b> may be located above the upper fabric <b>26</b> between the pickup box <b>54</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>. And similarly, sheet trim apparatus (not shown) may be located between the pickup box <b>54</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The lower fabric <b>28</b> continues down around a drive roll <b>62</b>. A spray <b>64</b> creates a flooded nip <b>66</b> between the upper side of the drive roll <b>62</b> and the lower fabric <b>28</b>. The flooded nip causes the web <b>68</b> if it has not been transferred by the pickup box <b>54</b> to become saturated and leave the lower fabric <b>28</b> under the influences of gravity. The lower forming fabric <b>28</b> returns to the forming section of the papermaking machine <b>20</b> through a series of idler rolls <b>70</b>. The lower fabric <b>28</b> enters a vertical run <b>72</b> where water showers <b>74</b> contained within baffles <b>76</b> clean the fabric <b>28</b> before it returns to the breast roll <b>24</b>. A stretcher roll <b>78</b> allows the tension in the lower fabric <b>28</b> to be adjusted and a guide roll <b>80</b> guides the fabric <b>28</b> into engagement with the breast roll <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After leaving the press roll <b>30</b>, the upper fabric <b>26</b> moves through a vertical run <b>82</b> where it is washed by water showers <b>84</b> within baffles <b>86</b>. The upper fabric <b>26</b> passes over an adjustable stretcher roll <b>88</b> and returns to wrap around the breast roll <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an addition of a second upper fabric <b>90</b> between the air press <b>48</b> and the press roll <b>30</b>. The addition of the second fabric <b>90</b> involves the elimination of the web transfer pickup box <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the addition of a suction pickup roll <b>92</b> which takes the web <b>36</b> from the lower fabric <b>28</b>. The pickup roll <b>92</b> is adjustable and the second upper fabric <b>90</b> is operated at a lower speed than the lower fabric <b>28</b> so that a rush transfer is created wherein a creping like action takes place as the web transfers from the lower fabric <b>28</b> to the slower speed fabric <b>90</b>. The second upper fabric <b>90</b>, after wrapping around the press roll <b>30</b>, enters an inclined cleaning run <b>94</b> where a water shower <b>96</b> is followed by an air knife <b>98</b>. The second upper fabric <b>90</b> then turns around a helper drive roll <b>100</b> to a stretcher roll <b>102</b> and returns to the suction pickup roll <b>92</b>. The use of a rush transfer increases the bulk and absorbency of the web <b>36</b> without additional fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Rush transfer can also be accomplished with a vacuum pressure roll <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The vacuum pressure roll <b>104</b> is positioned between the Yankee dryer <b>32</b> and the lower fabric <b>28</b>. The tail cutter <b>60</b> is positioned below the lower fabric <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A trim means (not shown) can also be positioned above the lower fabric <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second lower fabric <b>106</b> can be employed with the papermaking machine <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a vacuum pickup roll <b>108</b> is added to the upper fabric <b>26</b> just in front of the steam shower <b>44</b> to pick the web off the lower forming fabric <b>28</b>. A drive roll <b>110</b> is added inside the loop formed by the lower fabric <b>28</b>. The second lower fabric <b>106</b> incorporates a shower <b>112</b> and an air knife <b>114</b> downstream of the flooded nip <b>66</b> to clean the second lower fabric <b>106</b>. By dividing the lower fabric into two parts the ability to mold the web <b>36</b> into a specialized fabric is created. Thus the second lower fabric <b>106</b> may have a texture which imparts specialized functionality or appearance to the web <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The ability to create a rush transfer as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in combination with molding the web <b>36</b> with a second lower fabric <b>106</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An alternative embodiment papermaking machine <b>116</b> for forming tissue grades of paper is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The papermaking machine <b>116</b> employs a twin wire former <b>118</b> formed by an upper forming fabric <b>120</b> and a lower forming fabric <b>122</b> which wrap around a breast roll <b>124</b>. The breast roll <b>124</b> is inside the loop formed by the lower fabric <b>22</b>. The upper fabric <b>120</b> comes together with the lower fabric <b>122</b> to form a nip <b>126</b>. A headbox <b>128</b> injects a stream of stock into the nip <b>126</b>. Centrifugal force causes water to be thrown outwardly and be captured by baffles <b>130</b> which direct water to a saveall <b>132</b>. In all other respects, the papermaking machine <b>116</b> is similar to the machine <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various modifications to the basic machine <b>116</b> can be made by incorporating a second upper fabric <b>90</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or a vacuum pressure roll <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and shows the addition of a second lower fabric <b>106</b> which provides the ability to mold a pattern into the web <b>36</b>. The features of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be incorporated with the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to produce the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> which is similar to the crescent former of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be understood that the breast roll used in the crescent former or the twin wire former may be a vacuum roll or may be a plain roll depending on various factors including the speed and thickness of the web being formed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be understood that wherein a rush transfer is described, a drag transfer where the web is stretched is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be understood that the suction pickup roll <b>92</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref> could be a suction shoe which does not rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In interpreting the drawing rolls shown with opposed dark sectors near the center are drive rolls or assistant drive rolls. Rolls with an arrow passing through them are mounted to move to adjust tension in a forming fabric. Rolls which show a pivot line as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> symbolize the mounting of the roll to pivot as indicated by the arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Certain grades of paper, such as tissue paper or creped papers, are typically formed by pressing the web onto a large diameter Yankee dryer, and creating a soft absorbent web by scraping the web off the dryer surface with a doctor blade. Alternative approaches hold out the possibility of increasing absorbency and increased forming speed while living within the limitations of an existing single large diameter Yankee dryer. Rush transfer is an alternative means of increasing absorbency in the formation of a tissue web. New approaches may lead to more cost-effective approaches to manufacturing these important and widely used grades of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a paper machine for manufacturing a creped tissue web comprises a first forming fabric forming an endless loop; a second forming fabric forming an endless loop, the second forming fabric coming into engagement with the first forming fabric and forming a twin wire former; a headbox positioned to inject a stream of paper stock between the first forming fabric and the second forming fabric; a Yankee dryer for drying the tissue web, the first fabric being adapted to carry the web to the Yankee dryer; a third fabric, the third fabric arranged to run together with the first forming fabric and adapted to enclose the tissue web therebetween; and a dewatering device adapted to dewater the tissue web situated between the third fabric and the first forming fabric, said dewatering device comprising a device for applying a vacuum for creating an air flow through the third fabric, the first forming fabric, and the tissue web therebetween, one of said first forming fabric and third fabric having a texture, which when the fabrics run over the vacuum device said texture is being imparted to the tissue web.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The dewatering device in one embodiment comprises the vacuum device having a curved surface interacting with the first forming fabric and the third fabric. Alternatively, the dewatering device comprises an air press having a pressurized device and a vacuum device. The dewatering device can further comprise a steam device positioned over the vacuum device for heating the web sandwiched between the third fabric and the first forming fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the first forming fabric extends to the Yankee dryer. A roll can be arranged to transfer the tissue web having the imparted texture to the Yankee dryer while being supported by the first forming fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The dewatering device in some embodiments can be adapted to increase a solids content of the web to approximately 33%. The pressurized device can be adapted to apply a pressure of about 15 to 30 psi to the web. The vacuum device can be adapted to create the air flow through the first fabric and the third fabric and the tissue web sandwiched therebetween and adapted to apply about fifteen inches of mercury below atmospheric or about 7 psi vacuum. The air press comprising the dewatering device can be adapted to create a pressure drop across and through the thickness of the web of about 20-35 psi.</p>
