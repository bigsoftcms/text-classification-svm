<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/931,882 filed May 25, 2007.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates, in general, to storage of heated irons after use, and, more particularly, this invention relates to storage of electric clothes pressing irons and their cords.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior to the conception and development of the present invention, clothes pressing irons are typically stored after use either upright or horizontally on the horizontal ironing board with the unplugged cord dangling over the edges of the board. This poses a safety hazard besides being unsightly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A multitude of devices for storing pressing irons have been disclosed in the prior art. A number of these are wall mounted holders with built-in cord supports as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,116,550 and 7,004,433. Others focus on insulating the hot iron from surrounding surfaces during cooling after use. Examples of this are provided by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,909,862 and 6,226,904. A general characteristic of these prior-art devices appears to be a level of complexity and expense that are beyond what the average consumer finds worthwhile for such a simple purpose.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a pressing iron holder for electric clothing irons that includes a substantially planar base defining a blunt butt end, a top end, and two side edges, and a flange is fixedly attached substantially perpendicular to the planar base proximal the butt end. Additional features are cord retention protrusions from one of the two side edges for neatly storing the power cord, at least one semi-rigid retaining clip fixedly attached proximal midpoint of each side edge, and a grasping/hanging extension at the top end. In an alternative embodiment, the base structure consists of a heavy wire grid with various extensions for gripping and hanging the holder, and for storing the electric cord.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is, therefore, one of the primary objects of the present invention to provide a simple, inexpensive holder for pressing irons.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a holder for clothes pressing irons that can be readily transported and hung while the iron is still warm.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an economical storage device for pressing irons that can also neatly store the power cord.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to the various objects and advantages of the present invention described with some degree of specificity above, it should be obvious that additional objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those persons who are skilled in the relevant art from the following more detailed description of the invention, particularly, when such description is taken in conjunction with the attached drawing figures and with the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PRESENTLY PREFERRED AND VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Prior to proceeding to the more detailed description of the present invention it should be noted that, for the sake of clarity and understanding, identical components which have identical functions have been identified with identical reference numerals throughout the several views illustrated in the drawing figures.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention is shown, generally as <b>10</b>, in a perspective view. A solid, planar base plate <b>12</b> is shaped and sized similar to that of a common electrical pressing iron. At the widest point, its width should be between about one and twenty millimeters greater than that of the iron it is designed to hold. A flange <b>14</b> is attached perpendicularly across the bottom edge of base plate <b>12</b>. Two clips <b>16</b> are opposite one another along and near the center of the edges of the base plate <b>12</b> to aid in holding the iron in place. Two cord retaining prongs <b>18</b> extend out from one edge of the base in the same plane as the base. Attached to the top end of the base plate <b>12</b> is a combination carrying and hanging extension <b>20</b>, also extending in substantially the same plane. The end of extension <b>20</b> includes an aperture <b>22</b> that permits hanging the entire unit with iron attached on something like a nail. To use, one holds the iron, even if still warm, by its handle and with the soleplate parallel to the main plane of the base <b>12</b>, slides the bottom butt end of the iron past the retaining clips <b>16</b>, which spreads the clips <b>16</b> slightly. When the butt end of the iron meets the bottom flange <b>14</b>, the flange supports the bulk of the weight and the retaining clips <b>16</b> restrain side-to-side and movement away from the base <b>12</b>. The holder <b>10</b> and iron together can then be safely grasped and transported using extension <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a similar alternative embodiment of the present invention, generally shown as <b>10</b>. A rigid, heavy wire grid <b>13</b> forms the main base shaped and sized somewhat like a typical electric clothes iron. At the widest point, the width should be about one to twenty millimeters greater than that of the iron it will be holding. Two of the lateral wire members have bent extensions <b>24</b> to help hold the iron in place. These extensions <b>24</b> are inclined inward at between about a 75 to 85 degree angles to the plane of the grid. At the butt end of the base structure, the wire members are bent at about 90 degrees to form a bottom flange <b>14</b> for bearing most of the weight of the iron when held vertically. Two lateral wire extensions or prongs <b>18</b> are spaced along one edge to serve as a place for wrapping the power cord. Use of the device is essentially the same as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While a presently preferred and an alternative embodiment of the present invention have been described in sufficient detail above to enable a person skilled in the relevant art to make and use the same, it should be obvious that various other adaptations and modifications can be envisioned by those persons skilled in such art without departing from either the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.</p>
