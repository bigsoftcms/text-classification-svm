<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A compact twister and a method for producing a twisted wire that can efficiently produce a short twisted wire that satisfies performance requirements, as well as a ply and a pneumatic tire twisted using the twister or the method for producing a twisted wire, are provided. The twister includes a rotating body for twisting plural filament wires that are fed thereto to form a cord and for applying a feeding force to the cord. The rotating body includes a feeding mechanism within a housing, and the cord is discharged from the rotating body by the feeding mechanism. The twister carries out twisting operation with one of a cord side of a twisting point or a filament wire side of the twisting point being free. Thus, a compact twister, that can form a cord with excellent rotating property and straightness, is accomplished.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a twister for producing a twisted wire by twisting plural wire materials, and a method for producing a twisted wire, a ply, and a pneumatic tire. More particularly, the present invention relates to a twister that is suitable for producing a tire reinforcing cord for use in a tire, a method for producing a twisted wire, a ply, and a pneumatic tire.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional mass production of cord products, such as steel cords, basically, twisters are used to continuously twist wires and the resulting product (cord) is taken up on a reel. When several solid wires are twisted together to produce a cord, it is necessary to make twisting rotation at both sides of a twisting point of the wires along a progressing direction of the wires. Therefore, it is necessary to rotate one of the material (i.e., the solid wires) side and the product (i.e., the cord) side of the wires in the same direction of the twisting rotation, or alternatively, it is necessary to make one of the solid wires and the cord supported within a rotating body and advance along the rotating body rotating around the wires or the cord, so that the one of the solid wires and the cord is twisted around the other of the solid wires and the cord (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 6-200491 and 9-291488).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in tire production, a sheet-like tire intermediate material is made, in which steel cords are embedded in a barred lattice pattern in a rubber sheet. It is thus desired that the steel cord used as a tire reinforcing material is as long and continuous as possible, and is generally produced to have a length of several thousand meters to tens-of-thousands of meters.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method is known, where a product (twisted wire) is produced by repeatedly inverting a twisting direction at certain intervals with opposite ends being fixed, and therefore unrotated. However, in this method, although each area that is shorter than the interval of the inversion remains twisted, there are inevitably sections where the wires are not twisted between the inversion intervals. In addition, since the twist of the product is cancelled as a whole by the repeated inversion, this method does not produce a good twisted wire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to produce a cord, it is necessary to twist wires as many times as possible within a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since only a single or double twisting can be made by a single rotation of a device (a single rotation of a rotating body), there arises a problem that a number of devices (twisters) are necessary. The equipment investment for the devices of this type actually constitutes a large portion of cord production costs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is desirable that a twister can rotate at a high-speed. There is a natural limit in the rotation speed of the twister, due to the durable load of a centrifugal force resulting from high-speed rotation and rotational vibration. If a twister is made compact and a rotation frequency thereof is increased to reduce the equipment cost, a winding size of a bobbin is decreased and the bobbin must be replaced more frequently, resulting in lower efficiency. In addition, there is also a limit in size reduction in view of ensuring continuity during the tire production process.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In contrast, if a winding size of a bobbin is increased to reduce required operation steps, a twister becomes huge and a centrifugal force is increased, and therefore a rotation speed cannot be increased, resulting in increase in the equipment cost. Due to this problem, a size and a rotation speed of a twister are set at compromising values in consideration of a balance therebetween, and this makes it difficult to reduce production costs further from the current level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, since it is normal practice to continuously produce a product having a length of several thousands to several ten-thousands meters, if a problem such as a wire breaking occurs during production, it is necessary to remove a defective product, whose length does not reach a predetermined length, through specific operations such as scrapping or welding. That is, a significant number of extra processes are required to recover the normal state of production.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In tire production, a large quantity of steel cords are processed at the same time with a large calendaring machine or stelastic. Therefore, a process lot is large and this leads to potential problems of increase in stock and increase in a lead time from production to shipment. Further, since it is troublesome to change properties of steel cords for each tire product and/or for each portion of a tire (this would result in low production efficiency), production of diverse products has been inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, since a continuous steel cord is generally produced and supplied in conventional steel cord production processes, although quality characteristics of a cord can be altered in a longitudinal direction thereof, it is difficult to correctly locate each site of a cord at its specified position on a tire all the time. Therefore, in order to alter quality characteristics of a steel cord in accordance with the respective sites of a tire, it is necessary to form a tire in a state where a corresponding number of intermediate cord-rubber composite products have been prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, in cord production using conventional twisters, it is difficult to reduce and stabilize levels of rotating property and straightness of cords, which significantly influence operational efficiency of a cutting process and a forming process at tire factories. Although efforts have been made on quality improvement and stabilization of the rotating property and the straightness of cords, these are still problems that have not yet been solved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the foregoing facts, the present invention is directed to provide a compact twister and a method for producing a twisted wire, which can efficiently produce short twisted wires that satisfy performance requirements. The invention is also directed to provide a ply including twisted wires that are twisted with the twister or twisted according to the method for producing a twisted wire, and a pneumatic tire including the plies.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect a twister includes a rotating body for twisting a plurality of wire materials fed thereto to form a twisted wire; and a discharging device for discharging the twisted wire from the rotating body, wherein one of a twisted wire side downstream of a twisting point and a wire material side upstream of the twisting point, of the wire, is free.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;free&#x201d; used herein refers to a state where one of the end portions of the wire, at opposite sides with respect to the twisting point, can be rotated in accordance with a twisting rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Even when a relative rotation is inevitably generated between the twisted wire side downstream of the twisting point and the wire material side upstream of the twisting point, since one of the end portions at the twisted wire side and at the wire material side is free, the twisted wire can be discharged from the twister with the twisted wire rotating, or the wire materials can be fed to the twister with the wire materials rotating, during the twisting operation. It is preferable that the wire materials or the twisted wire is shorter at the &#x201c;free&#x201d; side than the other side, in view of a structure of the twister and quality of the product (twisted wire).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a case where the wire materials or the twisted wire is sufficiently short, at the free side, a shape of each wire material is maintained by the rigidity of the wire itself. Therefore, the rotating wire materials need no guide member in contact therewith, or end portions of the wire materials can be positioned by a simple guide member that slightly contacts the rotating wire materials to guide and align them, thus enabling discharging of the twisted wire or feeding of the wire materials where the wire materials keep rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a case where the wire materials is relatively long at the free side thereof or where the wire materials are to be positioned at the free side thereof with high accuracy, it is possible to make the wire materials or the twisted wire relatively long at the free side by using a guide member or a chuck member that can rotate freely or synchronously so as not to hinder the rotation of the wire materials or the twisted wire. However, since the longer wire materials or twisted wire requires larger facilities, it is preferable that the length does not exceed about 10 m in an economic point of view.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A material type of the wire materials is not particularly limited, and the wire material may be a filament wire or a strand. A type of twisting is not particularly limited, and may include single twisting, multiple twisting, layered twisting, and the like. In a case where the wire material is a filament wire, a strand is produced (for example, if a material of the filament wire is steel, a steel strand is produced with the twister).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The discharging device may include various mechanisms such as one including a chuck to pinch and pull the twisted wire or one including a roller to nip and push the twisted wire out from the rotating body. It is necessary that the discharging device does not hinder the rotation of the wire materials or the twisted wire at the free side.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wire materials can be fed to the twister with a conventional technique for unwinding a wire material. For example, filament wires unwound with a constant tension may be passed through a preforming device or a jig to ensure necessary preforming to obtain final cord quality, and then, twisted by the twister and discharged from the rotating body. The discharged twisted wire is pushed out by its own rigidity and comes out with rotating in the same direction as the rotating body.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, in a case where a tire reinforcing cord is produced, the twisted wire is subsequently cut to a predetermined length to provide final tire reinforcing cord products. In this case, it is advantageous in view of cutting equipment costs and enhancing production efficiency that an exit portion of the twister is directly connected to a tire member producing apparatus to carry out cutting and rubber coating operations in a combined manner. Further, it is advantageous that the twister is coupled to or combined into the facilities for processing and forming tire members.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, since the cord is formed into a composite with rubber that is a tire reinforcing material in a state where the cord is freely rotatable, the cord makes no rotation or exhibits no tendency to rotate in the composite.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, with respect to the straightness of the cord, since each wire is twisted, a stress distribution in a filament circumferential direction is made even, and therefore a straight cord can be obtained. This principle similarly applies to conventional buncher-type twisters. However, in conventional buncher-type twisters, after a cord has been twisted, the cord passes through a guide, a pulley, a roller, and the like, and this process adversely affects the straightness of the cord which has been once straightened by twisting. Further, in conventional production methods, since a produced cord is taken up on a reel, the cord wound on the reel acquires a curling tendency over time and this further deteriorates straightness. On the other hand, in the present invention, a twisted cord is linearly discharged and is not taken up on a reel. Therefore, straight cords can be provided in a stable and continuous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, twister can be realized, wherein plural solid wires are twisted by a rotating body to form a twisted wire, and the twisted wire discharged from the rotating body is not taken on a reel as in the conventional twisters. In this manner, a compact twister that can form a twisted wire with excellent rotating property and straightness can be realized, and a required space as well as a price of this twister can be made one tenth of conventional twisters generally used in steel cord production.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When a twisted wire is produced using the twister the type of a wire material can be arbitrary selected. For example, a single or plural filament wires as a core and plural filament wires to form a sheath may be fed as wire materials, to produce a layered twisted cord with a compact structure, in which the core and the sheath are twisted in the same direction with the same pitch. Alternatively, plural filament wires as a core, which have been twisted in advance, may be unwound to be fed to the twister, to produce a layered twisted cord, in which pitches are different between the core and the sheath. Yet alternatively, a strand formed of two to seven filament wires that have been twisted in advance may be used as a wire material to be unwound and fed, to produce a multiple-twist cord. Further, a twisted wire may be made of two or more materials by selecting, as wire materials to be fed, plural filament wires of different materials. Moreover, a composite of a cord and rubber may be produced by twisting filament wires of steel, or the like, with a rubber-coated wire material or rubber processed to have a string-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The discharging device may be provided at the rotating body. When the discharging device and the rotating body are integrated in one structure, a size of the twister can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The discharging device may include a moving mechanism for holding the rotating body to be movable in a direction in which the twisted wire is discharged, and a rotating chuck provided at the rotating body for removably chucking the twisted wire.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The moving mechanism is a mechanism that holds the rotating body with a bearing or the like so that the rotating body can rotate freely. In order to discharge the twisted wire from the rotating chuck by a predetermined length, the twisted wire is chucked by the rotating chuck, and the rotating chuck in rotation is moved in a discharging direction by the moving mechanism. Subsequently, the twisted wire is released from the rotating chuck and the rotating chuck is returned to its original position by the moving mechanism. As a result, the twisted wire is discharged from the rotating chuck by a predetermined length.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A function of discharging the twisted wire and a function of applying rotation to the rotating body may be provided integrally or separately.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a case where these functions are provided separately, a portion of the discharging device gripping the wire is made to rotate freely so that the discharging device does not hinder twisting rotation. By providing these functions separately, it becomes easier to optimally design each of twisting function of the rotating body and discharging function of the discharging device, and to provide a twisting device where plural twisters are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a case where the above functions are provided integrally, it is necessary to provide a device for rotating the discharging device and the rotating body integrally or synchronously. However, this structure can make the best use of the advantage of the invention that the entire twister is compact and simple. In this case, the cord may be driven frictionally by plural rolls nipping the cord. However, since a large contact pressure is required to obtain a necessary driving force by simply nipping with the rolls, it is better to effect nipping with a multi-step mechanism or a caterpillar-like mechanism to prevent deterioration of product quality and durability of the device. As an approach for reducing the large contact pressure, the cord may be wound on a capstan to ensure a certain degree of frictional force and nipped by a roller in this state to drive the cord with a minimum contact pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the twister may be provided with a function of cutting a twisted product (twisted wire). In this structure, the twisted product (twisted wire) can be successively cut to a necessary length easily.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A ratio of a rotational speed of the rotating body to a discharging speed of the discharging device may be variable, and rotation and discharge may be effected with different timings. This facilitates to make the twisting pitch variable. For example, in a case of a twister including the rotating chuck and the moving mechanism described above, the moving mechanism may pull out the wire material by a predetermined length and stop its move, and then, the rotating chuck may be rotated to apply a necessary number of twists to the wire material. In this case, twisting is effected across the entire pulled-out portion of the twisted wire. Therefore, twisting is not limited to a point, but is effected over a certain length. Note that the term &#x201c;a twisting point&#x201d; herein refers to a place where twisting is carried out, and therefore, a difference in size of the place, i.e., long or short, does not contradict the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A twisting pitch is determined by a ratio of a rotational speed of the rotating body to a feeding speed of the wires to be twisted (a ratio of a speed of twisting rotation to a feeding speed of the wires to be twisted). Therefore, in order to have the twisting pitch constant, it is better to mechanically set the speed ratio. A twisting pitch can be freely changed at any time by making this ratio variable or enabling the speeds to be set freely by providing separate driving systems.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The twister of the invention is more suitable for producing very short twisted wire products having a length of several tens centimeters to several meters, which are used in an actual tire, rather than producing long twisted wire products having a length of several thousands to several ten-thousands meters. In this case, since it is not necessary to draw out a long twisted wire or to take up the twisted wire on a reel, the twisted wire can be linearly discharged from the rotating body with an end of the twisted wire rotating, to produce the twisted wire. Since a large rotating section such as those in conventional twisters is not necessary, and there is no need for a device to take up a twisted wire, the twister of the invention can be made remarkably smaller and simpler than conventional twisters. That is, device costs can be reduced and production of twisted wires can be carried out in a small space.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further the advantages of lower costs and compactness of the twister of the invention can be easily obtained by connecting the plural twisters in parallel to a single power unit and driving these twisters.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When a cord is produced, the cord, which is a product, and filament wires, which are components of the cord, can be placed outside of the rotating body. Since bobbins, on which filament wires are wound, are not placed inside with respect to the rotating cord, there is no need of stopping rotation of the rotating body when the bobbins (reels) are replaced to supply filament wires. Further, by increasing amounts of filament wires wound on the bobbins or continuously unwinding filament wires, a cord can be continuously produced without stopping rotation of the rotating body.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By combining a tire production apparatus and the twister good effects such as quick response to a small lot, reduction of space, elimination of cord stock, reduction of transportation work, elimination of wrapping materials for bobbins, or the like, can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, different from a conventional case where a huge calendaring machine is used to produce a tire intermediate member, small-lot cord production is possible, and cords can be produced when they are needed, right before a tire production facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A method for producing a short twisted wire by twisting a plurality of wire materials, wherein twisting is carried out with one of a twisted wire side downstream of a twisting point and a wire material side upstream of the twisting point, of the wire, being free. With this method, a twisted wire with excellent rotating property and straightness can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this case, a twister including a rotating body for twisting the plurality of wire materials to form the twisted wire and a discharging device for discharging the twisted wire from the rotating body may be used in the method, and a ratio of a rotational speed of the rotating body to a discharging speed of the discharging device may be variable to partially change a twisting pitch of the twisted wire.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, a single continuous twisted wire with partially altered twisting pitches can be produced, and the twisting pitch can be set to intended pitches. A twisted wire thus obtained is most suitable for use as a tire reinforcing cord. In other words, by specifying positions at which the cords are embedded in a tire, twisting quality or twisting property of the cord can be changed for each short cord, or for each position of each short cord in accordance with the portion of the tire where each cord is used. That is, twisting quality or twisting characteristics can be adjusted in accordance with the portions of a tire where the cords are to be used. Therefore, short twisted wires satisfying performance requirements can be efficiently produced. In addition, by distributing residual stress, preforming, and the like, tire reinforcing cords with additional qualities can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that the wire material may be a filament wire or a strand.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A ply comprises, as a cord, a twisted wire produced with the twister, or a twisted wire produced according to the method for producing a twisted wire.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This cord has excellent rotating property and straightness, and therefore, a flat belt ply with suppressed torsion and warpage can be obtained according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A pneumatic tire comprises the ply recited in claim <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, a pneumatic tire with improved tire performances such as uniformity can be accomplished.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Embodiments of the present invention are now described by way of examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A first embodiment will be described first. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view illustrating a structure of a twister <b>22</b> according to a first embodiment disposed in a cord production line <b>10</b>. The cord production line <b>10</b> includes bobbins <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C, each of which has a filament wire wound thereon, tension controllers <b>16</b>A to <b>16</b>C for respectively controlling tensions of filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C unwound from the bobbins <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C, and a twister <b>22</b> for twisting the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C fed via the tension controllers <b>16</b> to form a cord <b>20</b>. The twister <b>22</b> is an integrated feeding/rotating device that twists the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C to produce the single cord <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The twister <b>22</b> includes a preforming section <b>24</b> for preforming the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C, a twisting point forming section <b>28</b> forming a twisting point <b>26</b>, a rotating body <b>30</b> disposed downstream of the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>, and a motor <b>34</b> for imparting a torque to the rotating body <b>30</b> and a force for discharging the cord <b>20</b> from the rotating body <b>30</b>. The rotating body <b>30</b> is rotatably supported by bearing sections <b>36</b>A and <b>36</b>B disposed at the twister <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, at a downstream side of the rotating body <b>30</b>, a rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> is fixed to a rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b> extending like a short cylinder from a housing <b>31</b> of the rotating body <b>30</b>, and an endless belt <b>46</b> is supported by the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> and a first turntable <b>44</b> attached to the motor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">An elongated tube-like feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> for transmitting a force for feeding the cord <b>20</b> is inserted through the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b> so as to share the same rotation axes therewith, and is supported by the rotating body <b>30</b> via a bearing section <b>51</b>. An feed-driving pulley <b>52</b> fixed to the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> is disposed downstream of the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b>, and an endless belt <b>56</b> is supported by the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b> and a second turntable <b>54</b> attached to the motor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A feeding mechanism <b>58</b> for feeding the cord <b>20</b> is provided in the housing <b>31</b>. The feeding mechanism <b>58</b> includes a first gear <b>60</b> fixed at a distal end of the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> coaxially with the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b>, and a second gear <b>62</b> meshing with the first gear <b>60</b>. A small gear portion <b>64</b> having a smaller diameter is provided at a rotation center of the second gear <b>62</b>. The feeding mechanism <b>58</b> further includes a multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and a pinch roller <b>70</b>. The multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> includes a winding section <b>66</b>, on which the cord <b>20</b> is wound several times and a large gear portion <b>67</b> meshing with the small gear portion <b>64</b>. The pinch roller <b>70</b> abuts on the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> to press the cord <b>20</b> against the winding section <b>66</b>. The feeding mechanism <b>58</b> further includes a multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b>, on which the cord <b>20</b> wound on the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> is further wound several times.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Diameters of the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b> are determined with consideration of diameters and materials of the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C so that there is caused no problem in straightness of the cord <b>20</b> when the cord <b>20</b> fed from the rotating body <b>30</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, the twister <b>22</b> includes a cord discharging pipe guide <b>74</b>, which is inserted through the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b>, for guiding the cord <b>20</b> unwound from the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b> to a downstream side of the rotating body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A diameter of the first turntable <b>44</b> is slightly larger than a diameter of the second turntable <b>54</b>, to adjust a ratio of a rotational speed of the rotating body <b>30</b> (a twisting speed of the twisted wire) to a feeding speed of the cord <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, in the present embodiment, the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b> and the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> are coaxially disposed. This structure of the twister <b>22</b> is simpler than a structure where an additional motor for feed-driving is provided in the rotating body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the twister <b>22</b> is used, the motor <b>34</b> is rotated at a predetermined rotation speed, thus rotating the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b>, and then, a torque is sequentially transmitted to the first gear <b>60</b>, the second gear <b>62</b>, the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b>. As a result, the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C passed through the twisting point forming section <b>28</b> is discharged from the rotating body <b>30</b> at a predetermined discharging speed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, the rotation-driving dummy pulley <b>72</b> rotates, and the rotating body <b>30</b> rotates at a predetermined rotational speed. Therefore, the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C are pulled from the twisting point forming section <b>28</b> and are twisted to form the cord <b>20</b>, and the cord <b>20</b> is discharged from the rotating body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this manner, the feed-driving of the cord <b>20</b> is effected by the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> rotating on the rotating body <b>30</b> relatively to the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b>. In other words, a feeding speed is determined by a difference between a rotation frequency of the feed-driving shaft and a rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A ratio of a rotational speed of the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b> to a rotational speed of the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> is fixed by diameters of the pulleys, around which the belt is supported, and a gear ratio. In order to obtain the cord <b>20</b> twisted at an intended twisting pitch, in the present embodiment, the ratio is designed with consideration of a recovery amount from an elastic deformation of the filament wire material.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The reason for fixing the rotational speed ratio is to maintain a twisting pitch of a product (the cord <b>20</b>) at a predetermined ratio, even if the twister <b>22</b> is a simple device with no need of control. However, by making the ratio changeable or driving the two shafts separately to set any desired rotation speed, it is possible to freely change the twisting pitch. With such structures, the twisting pitch can be altered according to each intended portion of a tire. This enables to adjust characteristics of a tire by altering a twisting pitch of a single continuous cord member.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Conventionally, use of a cord, which is produced with a twister having such a variable pitch function, in a tire has been very difficult. Therefore, in order to make the best use of the advantage of the present invention, it is preferable to locate the twister in the vicinity of tire members or in the vicinity of an apparatus for producing a tire, in view of facilitating alignment of cords with proportions of the tire where the cords are intended to be used. Further, it is desirable to make the twister operable in combination with the apparatus for producing a tire.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A type of a cord that can be produced with the twister <b>22</b> is not limited to a steel cord, and cords made of organic fiber materials can also be produced, and similar effects can be obtained therefrom. Further, any of a composite formed by twisting a cord and an organic fiber, a composite formed by twisting a cord and a string-like rubber, a composite formed by twisting a cord, an organic fiber and a string-like rubber can be produced, such that reinforcing materials that meet required tire qualities can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, in the present embodiment, the rotating body <b>30</b> is provided with the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b> for rotatably driving the entire rotating body, and the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b> supported by the bearing section <b>51</b> coaxially with the rotation-driving shaft <b>40</b>. These two shafts are rotatably driven by the single motor <b>34</b>. Thus, the structure of the twister <b>22</b> can be made significantly simple. It should be noted that rotating body <b>30</b> may be provided with an electric motor, or the like, for generating a force for driving the feeding mechanism <b>58</b>. However, in the present embodiment, in order to make the device simpler, the feed-driving shaft is disposed coaxially with the rotation axis of the rotating body <b>30</b>, to drive the feeding mechanism <b>58</b> in the rotating body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, since the cord <b>20</b> is pulled out from the twisting point forming section <b>28</b> by the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding pulley <b>72</b> to discharge the cord <b>20</b> from the rotating body <b>30</b>, it is not necessary to press the cord <b>20</b> with the pinch roller <b>70</b> with a large force. Moreover, since the winding directions of the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b> are opposite from each other, and it is not necessary to take up the cord <b>20</b> on a reel, the cord <b>20</b> with significantly improved straightness can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">It should be noted that, although the present embodiment has been described with the example where the twister <b>22</b> is disposed downstream of the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>, it is possible that the twister <b>22</b> is disposed upstream of the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>, short filament wires that have been cut in advance are fed to the twister <b>22</b>, and then, a twisted wire is pulled out from the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The average and the degree of dispersion of rotating property and those of straightness of the cord produced with the twister <b>22</b>, which are theoretically zero, are also confined to be zero in the experiment data of the present example. Accordingly, it is understood that products of ideal quality can be provided in continuous and stable manner in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Since the average and the degree of dispersion of the rotating property and those of straightness of the cord were zero, there occurred neither torsion nor warpage in a treat of the tire reinforcing material where cords were embedded in a barred lattice pattern, and a completely flat treat was produced. Thus, it was found that deterioration of operational efficiency at tire factories due to torsion and warpage in treats can be completely eliminated, and tire performances such as uniformity can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Next, a second embodiment will be described. In the second embodiment, components that are the same as those of the first embodiment are assigned with the same reference numeral and explanations thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, a twister <b>82</b> according to the second embodiment is different from the twister of the first embodiment in a structure and operation of a feeding mechanism <b>78</b> provided in a rotating body <b>80</b>. Namely, in place of the pinch roller <b>70</b>, the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b>, and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), an intermediate gear <b>86</b> meshing with the small gear portion <b>64</b>; a first feeding roller <b>92</b> that has a first feeding gear portion <b>88</b> meshing with the intermediate gear <b>86</b> and also has a first pinch roller portion <b>90</b>; and a second feeding roller <b>98</b> that has a second feeding gear portion <b>96</b> meshing with the first feeding gear portion <b>88</b> and also has a second pinch roller portion <b>94</b>, are disposed in a frame member <b>81</b> of the rotating body <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The first pinch roller portion <b>90</b> and the second pinch roller portion <b>94</b> are in contact with each other so as to press against each other, and they nip the plural filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The twister <b>82</b> is further provided with a cutter <b>99</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) at a downstream side of the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b> to cut the cord to a predetermined length. A receiving section <b>100</b> for receiving the cut cords is disposed downstream of the cutter <b>99</b>. The receiving section <b>100</b> has a depression <b>101</b> formed at a center thereof along a feed direction of the cord. The receiving section <b>100</b> is optional.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the twister <b>82</b> according to the second embodiment, rotation of the motor rotates the rotating body <b>80</b> and the feed-driving shaft member <b>50</b>, and a torque is sequentially transmitted to the first gear <b>60</b>, the second gear <b>62</b>, the intermediate gear <b>86</b>, the first feeding roller <b>92</b> and the second feeding roller <b>98</b>. As a result, a feeding force is applied to the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C nipped between the first pinch roller portion <b>90</b> and the second pinch roller portion <b>94</b>. Therefore, the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C are twisted together and the resulting twisted cord <b>20</b> is discharged to a downstream side of the rotating body <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described above, in the second embodiment, in place of the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the first feeding roller <b>92</b> and the second feeding roller <b>98</b> having a diameter smaller than the multi-winding capstan <b>68</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>72</b>, respectively, are disposed in the frame member <b>81</b> of the rotating body <b>80</b>. This allows further reduction of a size of the rotating body <b>80</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, a third embodiment will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a twister <b>102</b> according to the third embodiment includes the preforming section <b>24</b> and the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>, similarly to the first embodiment, as well as a rotating chuck <b>104</b> disposed downstream of the twisting point forming section <b>28</b> and a motor <b>106</b> for providing a torque to the rotating chuck <b>104</b>. A rotating chuck driving pulley <b>108</b> is provided at the rotating chuck <b>104</b>, and a turntable <b>110</b> is provided at the motor <b>106</b>. An endless belt <b>118</b> is supported around the rotating chuck driving pulley <b>108</b> and the turntable <b>110</b>. The rotating chuck <b>104</b> is rotatably supported by a bearing section <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The rotating chuck <b>104</b> includes a chucking portion <b>118</b> for chucking the cord <b>20</b> pulled out from the twisting point forming section <b>26</b>, and a piston-like releasing portion <b>120</b> for switching between a gripping state and a releasing state of the chucking portion <b>118</b>. Further, the twister <b>102</b> includes a lever portion <b>122</b> for transmitting a moving force to the releasing portion <b>120</b> and a releasing piston portion <b>124</b> for transmitting a driving force to the lever portion <b>122</b> when chucking is released. The twister <b>102</b> further includes a guide pipe <b>128</b> for guiding the cord <b>20</b> toward a downstream side of the rotating chuck <b>104</b>, and a cutter <b>130</b> for cutting the cord <b>20</b> discharged from the guide pipe <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Moreover, the twister <b>102</b> includes: a slide bearing rail <b>136</b> for supporting a mount <b>134</b>, which supports the rotating chuck <b>104</b> and the motor <b>106</b>; a rack gear <b>138</b>; and a mount-moving motor <b>146</b>. The slide bearing rail <b>136</b> supports the mount <b>134</b> such that the mount <b>134</b> can move along a cord feeding direction U. The twister <b>102</b> further includes a chucking portion <b>148</b> between the twisting point forming section <b>28</b> and the rotating chuck <b>104</b> as well as a chucking portion <b>150</b> in the vicinity of an rear end of the slide bearing rail <b>136</b>, for removably chucking the cord <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In order to produce the cord <b>20</b> with the twister <b>102</b>, the chucking portions <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> are set in the releasing state and the rotating chuck <b>104</b> is set in the gripping state, and the motor <b>106</b> is rotated to rotate the rotating chuck <b>104</b> to twist the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C. At the same time, the mount-moving motor <b>146</b> is rotated to move the mount <b>134</b> backward at a predetermined speed. In this manner, the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C are twisted into the single cord <b>20</b> and the cord <b>20</b> is pulled out from the twisting point forming section <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In a state where the cord <b>20</b> is pulled out by a necessary length, the chucks <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> are set in the gripping state and the rotating chuck <b>104</b> is set in the releasing state, and then, the mount <b>134</b> is returned to its original position. As a result, the cord <b>20</b> is discharged from the rotating chuck <b>104</b> by a necessary length, and then is cut by the cutter <b>130</b> to obtain pieces of the cord <b>20</b> having necessary lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the third embodiment, the motor <b>106</b> for rotating the rotating chuck <b>104</b> and the mount-moving motor <b>146</b> for moving the mount <b>134</b> are driven independently from each other. Therefore, the twister <b>102</b> having a simple structure is realized, with which multi-line cords <b>20</b> having various lengths and various twisting point pitches can be produced as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the rotating chuck <b>104</b> is set in the gripping state and moved backward, the speed of the backward movement may be changed during the movement. In this manner, a twisting pitch can be partially changed within a single cord.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Next, a fourth embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of a twister <b>162</b> according to the fourth embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, components that are the same as those of the first embodiment are assigned with the same reference numeral and explanations thereof are omitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Rotating Body</heading>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the twister <b>162</b> of the fourth embodiment includes, in place of the rotating body <b>30</b> of the first embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a rotating body <b>170</b> disposed downstream of twisting point forming section <b>158</b>, the rotating body <b>170</b> being rotatably supported at a site thereof at a side where a cord <b>160</b> is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the present embodiment, the cord <b>160</b> pulled out from the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> is wound on an outer circumference of a multi-winding dummy pulley <b>172</b> and then on a multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> alternately for several times.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Since the cord <b>160</b> enters along a rotation center axis of the rotating body <b>170</b>, the multi-winding pulley <b>172</b>, on which the cord <b>160</b> is wound first, is disposed such that the outer circumference thereof is in contact with the rotation center axis of the rotating body <b>170</b>. In the first embodiment, the twisted cord <b>20</b> is first wound on the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>, and therefore, the outer circumference of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is positioned to be in contact with the rotation center axis of the rotating body <b>30</b>. However, since the multi-winding pulley <b>172</b> without a driving section therefor can more easily reduce size and weight thereof than the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>, an influence of a centrifugal force in a case where the multi-winding pulley <b>172</b> is offset by a radial length thereof can be made smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In this structure, a moment of inertia of the rotating body <b>170</b> about rotation center axis is significantly smaller than that in the first embodiment, and therefore, the rotating body <b>170</b> having good durability to high speed rotation can be obtained. If a bending pulley is introduced to change a path of the cord <b>160</b>, a weight and a size of the rotating body is increased. Therefore, the aforementioned effect of the present embodiment is critical.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It should be noted that positioning of parts of the rotating body <b>170</b> is determined through 3D calculations so that a weight for balancing the rotation is minimized, that is, a center of gravity is positioned on the rotation center axis. Further, a balance weight <b>166</b> may be provided, as necessary. This makes the above effect even more remarkable.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, the rotating body <b>170</b> is not provided with a housing. Therefore, a distance between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and the rotating body <b>170</b> can be made smaller than that in the first embodiment, and it is possible to reduce the distance as best as possible. Thus, when the cord <b>160</b> is produced with the twisting pitch thereof being changed during production, changes in an actual shape (a twisting pitch) of the cord <b>160</b> can well reflect changes in a rotation frequency provided at the twister <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a method of producing a twisted wire using this mechanism, a cord is formed by applying, to the cord <b>160</b> in a section between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and the rotating body <b>170</b>, a torsional deformation exceeding a torsional yield point of each filament wire material, to cause plastic deformation. Therefore, in the section between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and the rotating body <b>170</b>, the torsion of the cord <b>160</b> is propagated and averaged. Accordingly, in a case where the rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b> is changed to change the twisting pitch during production of a single cord, a longer distance between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and the rotating body <b>170</b> results in a longer influential range where the torsion is propagated and averaged, and a problem arises, that the changes in the twisting pitch of the cord <b>160</b> cannot catch up with a speed of changes in the rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b>. Therefore, by reducing the distance between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and the rotating body <b>170</b> as best as possible, as in the fourth embodiment, changes in the actual shape (the twisting pitch) of the cord <b>160</b> can more faithfully reflect the changes in the rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, the rotating body <b>170</b> is provided with a pressure roller <b>180</b> for pressing the cord <b>160</b> against the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>, and a pressure roller supporting device <b>182</b> for pressing the pressure roller <b>180</b> toward the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and rotatably supporting the pressure roller <b>180</b>. The cord <b>160</b> discharged from the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is pressed against an outer circumferential surface <b>168</b>S of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> by an outer circumferential surface <b>180</b>S of the pressure roller <b>180</b> with a constant pressing force (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The pressing force of the pressure roller <b>180</b> applied to the cord <b>160</b> by the pressure roller supporting device <b>182</b> can be set constant.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The outer circumferential surface <b>168</b>S of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is formed in a shape of a cylinder side surface. The cord wound on the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> at a topmost position thereof is drawn into an exiting-wire guide pipe <b>188</b> provided in the rotating body <b>170</b>, and is discharged from the rotating body <b>170</b> at a discharging side thereof. In order to bring the cord <b>160</b> at the topmost position of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> to a position where the cord <b>160</b> is easily guided into the exiting-wire guide pipe <b>188</b>, the outer circumferential surface <b>180</b>S of the pressure roller <b>180</b> has an annular projection <b>181</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), and the cord <b>160</b> wound on the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> at the topmost position thereof is positioned between the projection <b>181</b> and an upper rim <b>168</b>F of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although the projection <b>181</b> is formed only for the topmost cord position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, such a projection can be formed for each cord position. Alternatively, a similar effect can be obtained by providing a groove in the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>, instead of providing the outer circumferential surface <b>180</b>S of the pressure roller <b>180</b> with the projection <b>181</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The pressure roller <b>180</b> is formed to accept dimensional errors in the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the pressure roller <b>180</b>, and to allow passage of the cord <b>160</b> without damaging nodal sites of the cord <b>160</b>. In addition, the pressure roller <b>180</b> can be attached to and removed from the pressure roller supporting device <b>182</b> through a single simple operation, and therefore, it is easy to pass the cord <b>160</b> through between the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the pressure roller <b>180</b>. Moreover, the pressure roller is structured such that the pressing force thereof does not decrease due to vibration or a centrifugal force. Furthermore, since the pressure roller <b>180</b> is provided on the rotating body <b>170</b>, a centrifugal force is exerted to the pressure roller <b>180</b>, similarly to the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the other parts. However, by setting an extending/retracting direction and a supporting direction of the pressure roller <b>180</b> so as to avoid an influence of the centrifugal force, change in the pressing force due to rotation of the rotating body <b>170</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Since the wire material for the cord <b>160</b> and the like has a strong elastic force, when it is twisted, it accumulates a force to twist back. Therefore, when clamping of the wire material is released, the wire material springs back in a direction opposite to the twisting direction. In order to obtain a uniform quality of the cord in the longitudinal direction thereof, it is necessary to cause the cord to spring back stable and uniform over the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the present embodiment, by pressing the cord <b>160</b> by the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the pressure roller <b>180</b> with a constant set force, a tension of the cord <b>160</b> between the twisting point forming section <b>158</b> and an exit from the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is set at a constant value. Further, the outer circumferential surface <b>168</b>S of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the outer circumferential surface <b>180</b>S of the pressure roller <b>180</b> are formed to have a shape of a cylinder side surface and the cord <b>160</b> is pressed by a flat-bottom groove, to increase a contact surface between the groove bottom and the pressed cord <b>160</b> in a direction perpendicular to the cord <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">This makes twisting back (springing back) of the cord <b>160</b> continuous and stable over the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Driving Motor</heading>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the twister <b>162</b> includes a rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> for rotating the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> and a feed-driving motor <b>185</b> for rotating the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b>, in place of the motor <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the first embodiment. An endless belt <b>186</b> is supported around the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> and the rotation-driving motor <b>184</b>, and an endless belt <b>187</b> is supported around the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is driven, via a driving gear (not shown), by a drive input shaft (not shown) disposed at a position of a rotational axis of the rotating body <b>170</b>. Therefore, a rotational speed of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is determined by a difference between a rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b> and a rotation frequency of the drive input shaft, i.e., by a relative rotation frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">On the other hand, a feeding speed of the cord <b>160</b> is determined by a rotational speed of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b>, and a twisting speed of the cord <b>160</b> is determined by a rotational speed of the rotating body <b>170</b>. Therefore, as in the present embodiment, by providing the rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b> independently from each other, and changing a ratio of rotation frequencies, i.e., a shaft speed ratio between these two motors during production of a cord, a twisting pitch of the cord can be freely changed in the midway of the cord. It should be noted that the twister <b>162</b> includes a controlling section (not shown) including a computer program for calculating and controlling rotation frequencies of the rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b>, so that the twisting pitch can be switched between desired pitches with the feeding speed of the cord <b>160</b> kept constant.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">An operation with a variable twisting pitch can be carried out without keeping the feeding speed of the cord <b>160</b> constant. However, a feed amount of each filament wire material is stabilized under an operation with a constant feeding speed, so that a tension of each filament wire material can be controlled in a easy and stable manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Preforming Section</heading>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the twister <b>162</b> includes hole guides <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> sequentially disposed upstream of the twisting point forming section <b>158</b>, for respectively passing the three filament wires <b>18</b> therethrough, and a preforming section <b>200</b> for preforming the filament wires <b>18</b> disposed upstream of the hole guide <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The preforming section <b>200</b> includes a preforming roll <b>206</b> for preforming the three filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C. The preforming section <b>200</b> further includes an incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> disposed upstream of the preforming roll <b>206</b>, and a pulley position adjuster <b>212</b>. The incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> contacts the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C at a lower portion of the outer circumferential surface thereof to adjust an incidence angle of the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C to the preforming roll <b>206</b>. The pulley position adjuster <b>212</b> supports the incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> so as to be movable in a vertical direction that is substantially perpendicular to the feeding direction of the filament wires <b>18</b>A to <b>18</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The preforming section <b>200</b> further includes a guide pulley <b>214</b> disposed upstream of the incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b>. In addition, a wire-speed detection pulley <b>216</b> for detecting a feeding speed of the filament wires <b>18</b> is disposed upstream of the guide pulley <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this structure, the incidence angle to the preforming roll <b>206</b> can be adjusted by adjusting a position of the incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In place of the pulley position adjuster <b>212</b>, a pulley holding section <b>220</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, may be included. The pulley holding section <b>220</b> has a sectoral contour, rotatably supports the incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> at an upper end thereof, and is pivotable about a pivot center <b>211</b>. In this case, a circular arc outline portion <b>222</b> including a driven gear <b>221</b> formed at an outer circumference thereof is provided at the pulley holding section <b>220</b>. Further, a driving gear <b>224</b> meshing with the driven gear <b>221</b> and a driving gear motor (not shown) for driving the driving gear <b>224</b> are provided at the preforming section. When the twister is in operation, a position of the incidence angle adjusting pulley <b>210</b> can be precisely adjusted by controlling the driving gear motor. This makes it possible to process the cord with a desired amount of preforming being applied thereto, and thus a cord having degree of preforming continuously adjusted can be produced.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Cutter</heading>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The twister <b>162</b> further includes a cutter (not shown) for cutting the cord <b>160</b> discharged from the rotating body <b>170</b> to a constant set length.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The cutter includes a blade that moves toward the cord <b>160</b>, a spring for urging the blade, and a motor or an actuator (none of which is shown) for compressing the spring. The spring compressed by the motor or actuator accumulates energy, and when the compressed spring is released, the blade is moved immediately to cut the cord <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In this manner, the cord <b>160</b> can be cut with the cutter to a desired set length, thereby increasing degree of freedom in design conditions and production conditions for tires. Further, since a moving speed of the blade is increased using a spring, the cutter can be made small enough.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As an example of high-speed of the blade, it takes 20/1000 second from a time of instruction of cutting to a time when the blade movement has stopped, and a cutting operation takes 5/1000 second. As a time interval between each cutting operation is usually one second, and there is an enough time to compress the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It should be noted that, without using a spring, the cord <b>160</b> can also be cut to a constant set length by providing a mechanism for moving the blade position at the same speed as the feeding speed of the cord <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described above, in the present embodiment, a moment of inertia of the rotating body <b>170</b> about the rotation center axis is significantly smaller than that in the first embodiment. Therefore, a centrifugal force exerted on the bearing of the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is reduced, so that the rotating body <b>170</b> that exhibits good durability for high speed rotation can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Further, the rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> for rotating the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b> for rotating the feed-driving pulley <b>52</b> are provided for separately driving the rotation-driving pulley <b>42</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b>. Therefore, a feeding speed and a pitch of the cord <b>160</b> can be separately controlled by changing rotational speeds of the motors.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Yet further, since the rotating body <b>170</b> is not provide with a housing such as in the first embodiment, the twisting point can be positioned nearer to the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> and the multi-winding dummy pulley <b>172</b> than in the first embodiment. Since a distance from the twisting point to a point of winding by the rotating body <b>170</b> is shorter than in the first embodiment accordingly, when a rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b> is changed, a change in a twisting pitch of the actually processed cord <b>160</b> can well reflect the change in rotation frequency of the rotating body <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Moreover, the driving gear (not shown) for driving the multi-winding capstan <b>168</b> is made of a resin that has a lubrication effect by itself. This renders unnecessary using a grease or an oil for lubrication. Therefore, there arises no problem in lubricity even when a centrifugal force is generated at the driving gear due to the rotation of the rotating body <b>170</b>. Further, a great effect can be obtained in size and weight reduction of the rotating body <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">It should be noted that plural cords <b>160</b> may be produced simultaneously by arranging plural sets of components other than the rotating body <b>170</b>, the preforming section <b>200</b>, the cutter or the like, the rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> and the feed-driving motor <b>185</b>, and using a common rotation-driving motor <b>184</b> and a common feed-driving motor <b>185</b>. Plural cords can thus be produced with a more compact system. In this case, in order to arrange cords at appropriate intervals at a production site of pneumatic tires, a tube guide for guiding cords from the rotating body <b>170</b> may be provided. In this manner, pneumatic tires can be efficiently produced.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Next, a fifth embodiment will be described. In the present embodiment, a cord made of steel (steel cord) is produced as described in the first embodiment, and the steel cord is cut to a predetermined length to make cord pieces <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</figref>), and a belt ply with the cord pieces <b>21</b> embedded therein is produced. The belt ply is used to produce a pneumatic tire.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the present embodiment, a cord piece table <b>232</b> including multiple grooves <b>230</b> formed therein for aligning the cord pieces <b>21</b> in parallel with each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, is prepared in advance. A projection <b>234</b>, which is rhomboidal when viewed from above, is formed at the cord piece table <b>232</b>, and the multiple grooves <b>230</b> are formed in an upper surface of the projection <b>234</b>. A length of each groove <b>230</b> is the same as a length of each cord piece <b>21</b>, and each groove <b>230</b> is open at both ends thereof. A shape of the projection <b>234</b> when viewed from above is determined with consideration of a shape of a belt piece <b>236</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Further, the projection <b>234</b> includes a magnet (not shown) embedded therein for attracting the cord pieces <b>21</b> with a magnetic force.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">To produce a pneumatic tire of the present embodiment, first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the cord pieces <b>21</b> cut to a predetermined length are placed in the grooves <b>230</b> in the projection <b>234</b>. As a result, the cord pieces <b>21</b> are held at groove bottoms of the projection <b>234</b> by the magnet (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the cord piece table <b>232</b> is turned over and pressed against the rubber piece <b>238</b> from above. Since an adhesion of a rubber piece <b>238</b> to the cord pieces <b>21</b> surpasses an attraction of the magnet, when the cord piece table <b>232</b> is lifted, the cord pieces <b>21</b> are transferred onto the rubber piece <b>238</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Then, a rubber sheet is placed over the rubber piece <b>238</b> and the cord pieces <b>21</b>, and the assembly are punched with a pressing machine to form a rhomboidal belt piece <b>236</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The belt pieces <b>236</b> thus produced are sequentially joined such that the cord pieces <b>21</b> are in parallel with each other to produce a belt ply <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Then, a pneumatic tire is produced using the thus made belt plies <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As described above, in the present embodiment, the steel cord produced as described in the first embodiment is cut to a predetermined length to make the cord pieces <b>21</b>, and the cord pieces <b>21</b> are used to produce the belt plies <b>240</b>. Then, the belt plies <b>240</b> are used to produce a pneumatic tire. The steel cord produced as described in the first embodiment has rotating property and straightness, of which average and degree of dispersion are zero, respectively. Therefore, the belt ply <b>240</b> using the cord pieces <b>21</b> obtained by cutting the above-described steel cord has neither torsion nor warpage, and can be made completely flat. Further, a pneumatic tire <b>242</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) using the belt ply <b>240</b> has improved tire performances such as uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">It should be noted that, although the cord pieces <b>21</b> obtained by cutting the steel cord of the first embodiment is used in the present embodiment, a steel cord produced as described in the second or third embodiment may be cut and used.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">First, a rubber sheet (not shown) having the same shape as the depression <b>250</b> (when viewed from above) is laid on the depression <b>250</b>. Then, the steel cord pieces <b>21</b> cut to a predetermined length are placed one by one on the rubber sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Further, a rubber sheet <b>257</b> having the same shape as the projection <b>254</b> (i.e., a shape obtained by inverting the rubber sheet placed in the depression <b>250</b>) is laid on the projection <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Subsequently, the upper template <b>256</b> is inverted and the projection <b>254</b> is mated with the depression <b>250</b>.</p>

In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, each of the cord pieces <b>21</b> is positioned one by one on a sheet-like green tire <b>294</b> by robot handling and is pressed with a pressing roll <b>296</b> to be embedded in the green tire to form a belt ply.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In this manner, an ideally flat belt ply with neither torsion nor warpage can be produced, without placing the cord pieces <b>21</b> on a cord piece table or forming a rubber-coating layer on each cord piece <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The embodiments of the invention have been described in detail above. These embodiments are only examples, and various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. Further, it is obvious that the scope of the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.</p>
