<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns flat weft-knitting field in the knitting industry, particularly relates to a new method that can adopt the flat weft knitting machine to continuously weave the knitwear whose that appearance can be seen structure texture pattern of X-yarn by a semi-turn (or semi-twist), Y-yarn by the semi-turn and the special-purpose yarn guiding mouth thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The flat weft knitting machine in prior art includes flat machine and Kedeng machine, while mechanical flat weft knitting machine has hand-handled or electric driven two types. The yarn guiding mouth on the weft knitting machine has only two forms: One is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, of a general yarn guiding mouth, including a fixed bar <b>1</b>, a movable fixed Bays <b>2</b>, a guiding hole <b>3</b>, and a yarn guiding mouth head <b>4</b>, installed on the flat weft knitting machine via movable fixed bay. Such kind of yarn guiding mouth pattern is now used on 80% of the weft knitting machines (computerized or hand-handled machines). Another type is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a common replenishing yarn guiding mouth, including the fixed bar <b>1</b>, the movable fixed bays <b>2</b>, guiding holes <b>3</b>, a main yarn guiding mouth <b>5</b>, a replenishing yarn guiding mouth <b>6</b>, the guiding holes <b>3</b> are open on top of the main yarn guiding mouth <b>5</b>, there is a gap between the main yarn guiding mouth <b>5</b> and the replenishing yarn guiding mouth <b>6</b> (namely, replenishing yarn hole <b>7</b>), a base yarn (or main yarn, X-yarn) goes through the main yarn guiding mouth <b>5</b>, the replenishment yarn (an auxiliary yarn, Z-yarn) goes through the replenishing yarn hole <b>7</b>. Z-yarn is always higher than X-yarn when functioning. This kind of replenishing yarn guiding mouth is mainly used to weave the replenishing yarn pattern. When the pattern is a single-sided pattern or stripe pattern, X-yarn is always on the front, while the Z yarn is always on the reverse side; When the pattern is Siping code or double-sided, X-yarn is at the surface, Z yarn is at the inside, in another word, base yarn (main yarn) coated the replenishment yarn (the auxiliary yarn) is coated by the main yarn; this can be applied to elastic material clothes, pants or coat collar, sleeves, cuff, hem, edges, the application rate can be of 20%. The above two type of yarn guiding mouth is commonly used in production and the third derivative yarn guiding mouth has not found so far.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional technologies of weaving bands of color have to change yarn manually, while machinery changes the yarn guiding mouth. Particularly, when producing the one yarn, one color replacement pattern, the mechanical devices transform the yarn guiding mouth, so as to achieve a switch to X-yarn, then switch to a Y-yarn, workers rely on the memory to repeat the cycle of transformation of the yarn guiding mouth. The smallest bands are knitted by changing a yarn for each turn with the method, or switch color for each twist. The shortcoming of this approach is: easily remember incorrectly, and it is difficult to needle the collar. It could easily produce sub-quality product. However, cost by using a method of computer-controlled weaving is very high with double working hours to produce the same product which is to be done manually. The cost of working hours, relying on yarn for weaving from the guiding mouth has been doubled, compared with the cost of ordinary yarn woven manually. Production cost has been doubled as well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional production methods of weaving are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">(1) The guiding mouth employed on a single color of the fabric, that is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> ordinary yarn guiding mouth;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">(2) X, Y colored yarn is woven together, its textured surface changes irregularly, this approach also uses the ordinary yarn guiding mouth (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>);</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">(3) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the pattern woven out through the replenishing yarn guiding mouth by putting X-yarn at the front view, Y-yarn to the reverse side). This method can replenish elastic yarn such as spandex yarn, nylon yarn for knitting gloves, socks, elastic pants, a jacket collar, lower hem edge, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(4) Other yarn weaving is about X-yarn in a turn and Y-yarn in another turn, in which yarn changing device was applied manually or computer-based automatic yarn guiding mouth was applied. Yarn changing and guiding mouth and adjusting machine needle into circles et al. were applied to other yarn weaving such as Jacquard.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The purpose of this invention is to provide the method for knitting out semi-turn X-yarn and semi-turn Y-yarn structural texture and the yarn guiding mouth (or thread guide) thereof. This method does not require changing the yarn and the yarn guiding mouth, and it is not necessary to memorize the changing manually, thus its production takes the same working hours as the common replenishing yarn guiding mouth does.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technological program of the invention is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method for knitting out semi-turn X-yarn semi-turn and Y-yarn structural texture is that X-yarn and Y-yarn can be fed through two yarn guiding holes being parallel placement independently; Alternatively, X-yarn, Y-yarn and C-yarn can be independently fed through three guiding holes being parallel placement; Or, Z-yarn can be fed through outside of two or three guiding holes being parallel placement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method for knitting out semi-turn X-yarn and semi-turn Y-yarn structural texture is that X-yarn and Y-yarn are separately fed through two guiding holes being parallel placement. The two guiding holes are used as both of a main yarn guiding hole and a replenishing yarn hole;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Under the condition of an exterior edge of one guiding hole, at an exit of guiding hole, is higher than an interior edge of the guiding hole, and height of the exterior edge and the interior edge of another guiding hole, at the exit of guiding hole, are the same, if X-yarn is higher than Y-yarn before forming a ring (or circular), pattern of circled tissue is organized with Y-yarn on the surface or at the front and X-yarn inside or reverse side; if Y-yarn is higher than X-yarn before forming a ring, pattern of circled tissue is organized with X-yarn on the surface or at the front and Y-yarn inside or reverse side; However, X-yarn and Y-yarn have the same height in another way of semi-turn weaving, then, after forming a circle, weaving pattern is organized with X-yarn and Y-yarn at the same time, as an irregular distribution pattern. Ultimately, the entire weaving appearance is that X-yarn or Y-yarn pattern in one semi-turn weaving, X-yarn and Y-yarn coexistence pattern in another semi-turn weaving, wherein the pattern is a replenishment coated yarn weaving pattern;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the exterior edges of the guiding holes, at the exit of guiding holes, are higher than interior edges of the two guiding holes, If X-yarn is higher than Y-yarn in semi-turn weaving before forming a ring, the pattern of circled tissue is organized Y-yarn on the surface or at the front and X-yarn inside or reverse side; if Y-yarn is higher than X-yarn in semi-turn weaving, the pattern of circled tissue shows that X-yarn forms on the surface or at the front, Y-yarn forms inside or reverse side. Ultimately, the entire external pattern of weaving appears semi-turn X-yarn and semi-turn Y-yarn, which is a replenishing yarn coated weaving pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method for knitting out semi-turn X-yarn and semi-turn Y-yarn structural texture is that X-yarn and Y-yarn are separately fed through two guiding holes being parallel placement, while Z-yarn is fed through outside of the two parallel positioned guiding holes. The height of Z-yarn is as the same as highest point of X-yarn or Y-yarn, or slightly higher than that of X-yarn and Y-yarn;</p>

The guiding holes are parallel positioned, wherein, a surface of the exit of guiding hole <b>13</b> on the left is inclined plane a. At cross-section of the two guiding holes, the exterior edge of one guiding hole on the left, at the exit of guiding hole, is higher than the interior edge of guiding hole <b>8</b>, the exterior edge and interior edge of another guiding hole on the right, at the exit of guiding hole, are the same height. Two strands of yarn, X-yarn <b>10</b> and Y-yarn <b>11</b> are fed through the two parallel positioned guiding holes into the needle <b>12</b> placing on the needle plate <b>14</b>. Two strands of yarn X-yarn and Y-yarn respectively go through the two guiding holes for weaving. The head of the needle works from left to right (c direction). X-yarn is higher than y-yarn in a way of semi-turn. The pattern formed Y-yarn on the front view, X-yarn on the reverse side after forming a circular; the head of needle works from right to left, X-yarn and Y-yarn are at the same height in another way of semi-turn. The pattern of both front view and reverse side coexisted X-yarn and Y-yarn with irregular distribution. Ultimately, the entire weaving appearance is that X-yarn or Y-yarn pattern during one way semi-turn weaving, X-yarn and Y-yarn coexistence pattern during other semi-turn weaving, wherein the pattern is a replenishment coated yarn weaving pattern. In other words, with appearance, one kind of yarn is about two-third, another kind of yarn is about one-third. Methods of weaving and operating on trial are in similarity to the common yarn guiding mouth. But note that:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0056">(1) The distance between a clip (or a gripper) and the yarn guiding mouth of yarn with two strands shall be correctly positioned, the yarn of two strands can not be twisted together.</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0057">(2) The skip draft shall be with an appropriate tension. The distance between the yarn guiding mouth and the needle for forming a circle shall be well adjusted, and the two sides need to be basically consistent with each other.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">The patterns in appearance of X-yarn on the surface in one way of semi-turn weaving, X-yarn or Y-yarn patterns with irregular pattern by another semi-turn weaving can be continually weaved out when the yarn guiding mouth of the present invention is applied on flat-weft machines. This can be applied to all kinds of knitwear in combination with conventional yarn guiding mouth and methods in prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">(II) Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second kind of yarn guiding mouth in the present invention comprise of the fixed bar <b>1</b>, the movable fixed groove <b>2</b>, the guiding hole <b>3</b> and the head of yarn guiding mouth <b>4</b>, wherein the guiding hole are two with paralleled placement. The surface of the two exits of guiding holes <b>13</b> are as inclined plane b. From a view of the cross-section of the guiding holes in vertical direction, the exterior edges of the two exits of yarn guiding holes are higher than their interior edges. Two strands of yarn, X-yarn <b>10</b> and Y-yarn <b>11</b> are fed through two parallel positioned guiding holes on the left and on the right lead into the machine needle <b>12</b>. The needle <b>12</b> is positioned on the needle plate <b>14</b>. X-yarn and Y-yarn go respectively through the two guiding holes for weaving. The whole appearance of the pattern weaved out can be seen as semi-turn X-yarn, semi-turn Y-yarn on both the front and reverse side, namely, X-yarn in one semi-turn, Y-yarn in another semi-turn in appearance of the pattern. The operating on trial or the debug is similar to the first kind of yarn guiding mouth referenced above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cross-section of working process of the second kind of yarn guiding mouth with replenishment function by working with the head from left to right (c direction), wherein the guiding hole was designed in different diameters according to different type of machine, and height of the interior edge of guiding hole <b>8</b> and the exterior edge of guiding hole <b>9</b> shall be designed based on models of machine. Common materials of yarn guiding mouth with replenishment function and common yarn guiding mouth can be used in this invention. Reference number <b>10</b> indicates X-yarn, <b>11</b> indicates Y-yarn, which are fed through parallel positioned two guiding holes, X-yarn <b>10</b> and Y-yarn <b>11</b> go through holes guiding by the exterior edge of guiding hole <b>9</b> on the left and the interior edge of guiding hole <b>8</b> on the right side then into the needle <b>12</b> for forming a circle, thereby creating two different levels of yarn feeding angles. The pattern of yarn weaved out by the head moving from left to right at work, X-yarn on the reverse side in one semi-turn weaving, Y-yarn at the front view in another semi-turn weaving, namely, semi-turn X-yarn at the front view, semi-turn Y-yarn on the reverse side, in continuously doing so repeatedly, without changing yarn and yarn guiding mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">As the height of exterior edge and interior edge of the two exits of guiding holes are different, whatever direction the head works (to the left or to the right), it is possible to knit out the pattern, after forming a circular, of X-yarn on the front, Y-yarn on the reverse side in one semi-turn, or Y-yarn on the front, X-yarn on the reverse side in another semi-turn, and in continuously doing so over and over again. Patterns on the surface are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8-9</figref>. The height of X-yarn and Y-yarn are same since edges of exterior and interior of the two exits of guiding holes have same height; Then the pattern of irregular X-yarn or irregular Y-yarn distribution can be knitted out with the semi-turn effects.</p>
