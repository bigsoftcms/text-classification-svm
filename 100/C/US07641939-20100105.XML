<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors, such as those used for group III-V semiconductor epitaxy. The present invention relates more particularly to a CVD reactor that is configured to provide laminar flow of reactant gases while mitigating undesirable depletion of reactants, so as to achieve enhanced deposition uniformity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of group III-V compounds is a thin film deposition process utilizing a chemical reaction between a periodic table group III organic metal and a periodic table group V hydride. Various combinations of group III organic metal and group V hydride are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This process is commonly used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). The process usually takes place in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. CVD reactor design is a critical factor in achieving the high quality films that are required for semiconductor fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the gas flow dynamics for high quality film deposition favor laminar flow. Laminar flow, as opposed to convective flow, is required to achieve high growth efficiency and uniformity. Several reactor designs are commercially available to provide laminar growth condition on a large scale, i.e., high throughput. These designs include the rotating disk reactor (RDR), the planetary rotating reactor (PRR) and the close-coupled showerhead (CCS).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, such contemporary reactors suffer from inherent deficiencies which detract from their overall desirability, particularly with respect to high pressure and/or high temperature CVD processes. Such contemporary reactors generally work well at low pressures and relatively low temperatures (such as 30 torr and 700&#xb0; C., for example). Therefore, they are generally suitable for growing GaAs, InP based compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when growing group III nitride based compounds (such as GaN, AlN, InN, AlGaN, and InGaN), there are factors that become important when using such contemporary reactors. Unlike GaAs or InP based material, group III Nitride is preferably grown at substantially higher pressures and temperatures (generally greater that 500 torr and greater than 1000&#xb0; C.). When using the aforementioned reactor designs under high pressure and temperature conditions, heavy thermal convection inherently occurs. Such thermal convection undesirably interferes with the growth process, so as to degrade efficiency and yield.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This situation worsens when the gas phase is majority ammonia. Ammonia is commonly used as nitrogen source in the III nitride MOCVD process. Ammonia is much more viscous than hydrogen. When the ambient gas contains a high percentage of ammonia, thermal convection occurs more easily than when the ambient gas is majority hydrogen, which is the case for GaAs or InP based MOCVD growth. Thermal convection is detrimental to growing high quality thin films since hard-to-control complex chemical reactions occur due to the extended duration of the presence of reactant gases in the growth chamber. This inherently results in a decrease in growth efficiency and poor film uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to contemporary practice, a large gas flow rate is typically utilized in order to suppress undesirable thermal convection. In the growth of group III nitride, this is done by increasing the ambient gas flow rate, wherein the gas is typically a mixture of ammonia with either hydrogen or nitrogen. Therefore, high consumption of ammonia results, particularly at high growth pressure conditions. This high consumption of ammonia results in the corresponding high costs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Reaction between source chemicals in the gas phase is another important issue in the contemporary MOCVD process for growth of GaN. This reaction also occurs in the growth of other group III-Nitrides, such as AlGaN and InGaN. Gas phase reaction is usually not desirable. However, it is not avoidable in the group III nitride MOCVD process because the reaction is severe and fast.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the group III alkyls (such as trimethylgallium, trimethylindium, trimethylaluminum) encounter ammonia, a reaction occurs almost immediately, resulting in the undesirable formation of adducts</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Usually, when these reactions occur after all the source gases enter the growth chamber, the adducts produced will participate in the actually growth process. However, if the reactions happen before or near the gas entrance of the growth chamber, the adducts produced will have an opportunity to adhere to the solid surface. If this happens, the adducts which adhere to the surface will act as gathering centers and more and more adduct will consequently tend to accumulate. This process will eventually deplete the sources, thereby making the growth process undesirably vary between runs and/or will clog the gas entrance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An efficient reactor design for III-nitride growth does not avoid gas phase reaction, but rather controls the reaction so that it does not create such undesirable situations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Because the demand for GaN based blue and green LEDs have increased dramatically in recent years, throughput requirements from production reactors have become important. The contemporary approach to scale up production is typically to build larger reactors. The number of wafers produced during each run has increased from 6 wafers to more than 20 wafers, while maintaining same number of runs per day, in currently available commercial reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, when a reactor is scaled up this way, several new issues arise. Because thermal convection is as severe (or even more severe) in a larger reactor as in a smaller reactor, film uniformity, as well as wafer-to-wafer uniformity, are not any better (and may be much worse). Further, at higher growth pressures, a very high gas flow rate is needed to suppress thermal convection. The amount of gas flow needed is so high that modification and special considerations are required for the gas delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally, because of the high temperature requirements, the larger mechanical parts of such a scaled up (larger) reactor are inherently placed under higher thermal stress and consequently tend to break prematurely. In almost all reactor constructions, stainless steel, graphite and quartz are the most commonly used materials. Because of hydrogenation of the metals utilized (making them become brittle) and because of etching of graphite by ammonia at high temperatures, the larger metal and graphite parts tend to break down much sooner than the corresponding parts of smaller reactors. Larger quartz parts also become more susceptible to breakage because higher thermal stress.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another issue associated with large size reactors is the difficulty in maintaining high temperature uniformity. Thickness and composition uniformity can be immediately affected by the temperature uniformity of the wafer carrier surface. In large size reactors, temperature uniformity is achieved by using a multi-zone heating configuration that is complex in design. The reliability of the heater assembly is usually poor due to the aforementioned high thermal stress and ammonia degradation. These issues of process inconsistency and extensive hardware maintenance have a significant impact on production yield and therefore product cost.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example of a contemporary RDR reactor for use in GaN epitaxy is shown schematically. The reaction chamber has a double-walled water-cooled 10&#x2033; cylinder <b>11</b>, a flow flange <b>12</b> where all the reaction or source gases are distributed and delivered into chamber <b>13</b>, a rotation assembly <b>14</b> that spins the wafer carrier <b>16</b> at several hundreds of rotations per minute, a heater <b>17</b> assembly underneath the spinning wafer carrier <b>16</b> configured to heat wafers <b>10</b> to desired process temperatures, a pass through <b>18</b> to facilitate wafer carrier transfer in and out of the chamber <b>13</b>, and an exhaust <b>19</b> at the center of the bottom side of the chamber <b>13</b>. An externally driven spindle <b>21</b> effects rotation of the wafer carrier <b>16</b>. The wafer carrier <b>16</b> comprises a plurality of pockets, each of which is configured to contain a wafer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The heater <b>17</b> comprises two sets of heating elements. An inner set of heating elements <b>41</b> heats the central portion of the wafer carrier <b>16</b> and an outer set of heating elements <b>42</b> heats the periphery of the wafer carrier <b>16</b>. Because the heater <b>17</b> is inside of the chamber <b>13</b>, it is exposed to the detrimental effects of the reaction gases.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The spindle rotates the wafer carrier at between 500 and 1000 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As discussed previously, this design works well at lower pressures and temperatures, especially when the ambient gas is low viscosity. However, when growing GaN at high pressures and temperatures in a high ammonia ambient gas, then thermal convection occurs and gas flow tends to be undesirably turbulent.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simplified gas streamline is shown to illustrate this turbulence. It is clear that turbulence increase as the size of the chamber and/or the distance between the wafer carrier and the top of the chamber increases. When the design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is scaled up for higher throughput, the chamber <b>13</b>, as well as the wafer carrier <b>16</b>, is enlarged to support and contain more wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Gas recirculation cells <b>50</b> tend to form when there is turbulence in the ambient gas. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, such recirculation is undesirable because it results in undesirable variations in reactant concentration and temperature. Further, such recirculation generally results in reduced growth efficiency due to ineffective use of the reactant gas.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, more heating zones are required in a larger reactor. This, of course, undesirably complicates the construction of such larger reactors and increases the cost thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a comparison between a 7&#x2033; six pocket wafer carrier <b>16</b><i>a </i>(which supports six wafers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and a 12&#x2033; twenty pocket wafer carrier <b>16</b><i>b </i>(which supports twenty wafers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>) can easily be made. Each pocket <b>22</b> supports a single 2&#x2033; round wafer. From this comparison, it is clear that such scaling up of a reactor to accommodate more wafers greatly increases the size, particularly the volume, thereof. This increase in the size of the reactor results in the undesirable effects of thermal convection and the additional complexities of construction discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is well known, however, that the depletion effect is one major drawback in contemporary horizontal reactors. As reactants in the carrier gas proceed from the center toward the peripheral of the rotating disk, a substantial amount of the reactants is consumed along the way. This undesirably makes the thin film deposited thinner and thinner along the radial direction upon the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One contemporary approach to reduce the depletion effect is to use a high gas flow rate to reduce the concentration gradient along the radial direction. The drawback of this approach is an inherent decrease in growth efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a reactor which is not substantially susceptible to the undesirable effects of thermal convection and which can easily and economically be scaled up so as to increase throughput. It is further desirable to provide a reactor which has enhanced growth efficiency (such as by providing mixing of reactant gases immediately proximate a growth region of the wafers and by assuring intimate contact of the reactant gases with the growth region). It is yet further desirable to provide a reactor wherein the heater is outside of the chamber thereof, and is thus not exposed to the detrimental effects of the reaction gases. It is yet further desirable to mitigate the undesirable effects of depletion while maintaining growth efficiency, so as to provide enhanced deposition uniformity over the entire wafer.</p>

Preferably, the chamber is defined by a cylinder having one generally flat wall thereof defining a top of the chamber and the reaction gas inlet in located at approximately a center of the top of the chamber. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the chamber may alternatively be defined by any other desired geometric shape. For example, the chamber may alternatively be defined by a cube, a box, a sphere, or an ellipsoid.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Preferably, the chemical vapor the wafer carrier is configured to rotate about an axis thereof and the reaction gas inlet is disposed generally coaxially with respect to the axis of the wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter which is less that &#x2155; of a diameter of the chamber. Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter which is less than approximately 2 inches. Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter which is between approximately 0.25 inch and approximately 1.5 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus, the reaction gas inlet is sized so as to cause reaction gas to flow generally from a center of the wafer carrier to a periphery thereof in a manner that results in substantially laminar reaction gas flow. In this manner convection currents are mitigated and reaction efficiency is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Preferably, the reaction gas is constrained to flow generally horizontally within the chamber. Preferably, the reaction gas is constrained to flow generally horizontally through the channel. Preferably, the reaction gas is caused to flow outwardly at least partially by a rotating wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Preferably, the at least one reaction gas outlet formed in the chamber above a wafer carrier. Preferably, a plurality of reaction gas outlets is formed in the chamber entirely above the upper surface of the wafer carrier. Increasing the number of reaction gas outlet(s) enhances laminar flow of the reaction gas, particularly at the periphery of the wafer carrier, by facilitating radial flow of the reaction gas (by providing more straight line paths for gas flow from the center of the wafer carrier to the periphery thereof). Forming the reaction gas outlets entirely above the upper surface of the wafer carrier mitigates undesirable turbulence in the reaction gas flow resulting from the reaction gas flowing over an edge of the wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, at least one reaction gas outlet is preferably formed in the chamber above a wafer carrier and below a top of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The chemical vapor deposition reactor preferably comprises a reaction gas inlet formed generally centrally within the chamber and at least one reaction gas outlet formed in the chamber. The wafer carrier is disposed within the chamber below the gas outlet(s) so as to define a flow channel intermediate a top of the chamber and the wafer carrier such that reaction gas flows into the chamber through the reaction gas inlet, through the chamber via the flow channel, and out of the chamber via the reaction gas outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A ring diffuser is preferably disposed proximate a periphery of the wafer carrier and configured so as to enhance laminar flow from the reaction gas inlet to the reaction gas outlet. The wafer carrier is disposed within the chamber below the gas outlets so as to define a flow channel intermediate a top of the chamber and the wafer carrier such that reaction gas flows into the chamber through the reaction gas inlet, through the chamber via the flow channel, and out of the chamber via the reaction gas outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ring diffuser preferably comprises a substantially hollow annulus having an inner surface and an outer surface, a plurality of openings formed in the inner surface, and a plurality of openings form in the outer surface. The openings in the inner surface enhance uniformity of reaction gas flow over the wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The openings in the inner surface are preferably configured so as to create enough restriction to reaction gas flow therethrough so as to enhance a uniformity of reaction gas flow over the wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The ring diffuser is preferably comprised of a material which is resistant to deterioration caused by heated ammonia. For example, the ring diffuser may be formed of SiC coated graphite, SiC, quartz, or molybdenum.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to one aspect of the present invention, a ring seal is disposed intermediate the wafer carrier and the chamber. The ring seal is configured to mitigate reaction gas flow out of the chamber other than from the reaction gas outlet. The ring seal preferably comprises either graphite, quartz, or SiC.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to one aspect of the present invention, a heater assembly is disposed outside of the chamber and proximate the wafer carrier. The heater may be an induction heater, a radiant heater, or any other desired type of heater. Preferably, a heater purge system is configured to mitigate contact of reaction gas with the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Typically, a gas flow controller is configured to control the amount of reactant gases introduced into the chamber via the gas inlet port.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The wafer carrier is preferably configured to support at least three 2 inch round wafers. However, the wafer carrier may alternatively be configured so as to support any desired number of wafers, any desired size of wafers, and any desired shape of wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to one aspect of the present invention, the wafer carrier is configured so as to facilitate outward flow of reaction gas due to centrifugal force. Thus, the wafer carrier preferably comprises a rotating wafer carrier. The wafer carrier is preferably configured to rotate at greater than approximately 500 rpm. The wafer carrier is configured to rotate at between approximately 100 rpm and approximately 1500 rpm. The wafer carrier is preferably configured to rotate at approximately 800 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The apparatus and method of the present invention may be used to form wafers, from which a variety of different semiconductor devices may be formed. For example, the wafers may be used to form die from which LEDs are fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>, which depict presently preferred embodiments thereof. The present invention relates to a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor and an integrated multi-reactor system which is suitable for scaled up throughput. The reactor employs a geometry that substantially suppresses thermal convection, a gas injection scheme providing very high gas velocity to avoid adduct adhesion to surface, and a restricted growth zone to enhance growth efficiency (by reducing source gas consumption).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For high throughput configurations, multiple units of said reactor can be integrated. Each reactor in the multiple-unit configuration can be of a relatively small scale in size, so that the mechanical construction can be simple and reliable. All reactors share common gas delivery, exhaust and control systems so that cost is similar to the larger conventional reactor with the same throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The throughput scaling up concept is independent with respect to reactor design and can also be applied to various other reactor designs. In theory, there is no limit in how many reactors can be integrated in one system. But as a practical matter, the maximum number of reactors integrated is substantially limited by how the gas delivery system is configured. Both reactor design and the scaling up concept can also be applied to the growth of various different materials, and thus includes but is not limited to group III-nitride, all other group III-V compounds, oxides, nitrides, and group V epitaxy.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a reactor <b>100</b> has a narrow gas inlet <b>112</b> located at the top and center of the reactor cylinder <b>111</b>. The cylinder <b>111</b> is double walled and water cooled, like the reactor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The temperature of the water can be varied so as to control the temperature of the chamber <b>113</b>. A narrow gas channel <b>130</b> defined by the wafer carrier <b>116</b> and the top <b>131</b> of the reactor <b>100</b> directs gas outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Pockets formed in the wafer carrier <b>116</b> are configured to receive and support wafers <b>110</b>, such as 2 inch wafers suitable for use in the fabrication of LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The rotating wafer carrier <b>116</b> assists gas flow outwardly by its centrifugal force. The rotating wafer carrier <b>116</b> preferably rotates at between 10 and 1500 rpm. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, higher rotational speeds of the wafer carrier <b>116</b> typically result in greater centrifugal force being applied to the reaction gas.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">By introducing the gas from the center, the gas is forced to flow generally horizontally in the narrow channel <b>130</b>, making the growth process somewhat simulate a horizontal reactor. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, one advantage of a horizontal reactor is its higher growth efficiency. This is because all the reactants in a horizontal reactor are restricted to a much narrower volume, thus making the reactants more efficient in their contact with the growing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter, dimension A, which is less that &#x2155; of a diameter of the chamber. Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter which is less than approximately 2 inches. Preferably, the reaction gas inlet has a diameter which is between approximately 0.25 inch and approximately 1.5 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Unlike the use of additional gas flow to suppress thermal convection in the vertical type of reactor such as the RDR as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the suppression of thermal convection is accomplished by using the narrow flow channel <b>130</b>, so that gas flow is forced in the desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The distance between the upper surface of the wafer carrier <b>116</b> and the top of the chamber <b>111</b> is designated as dimension B. Dimension B is preferably less than approximately 2 inch. Dimension B is preferably between approximately 0.5 inch and approximately 1.5 inch. Dimension B is preferably approximately 0.75 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As discussed above, the depletion effect is one major drawback in horizontal reactors. As reactants in the carrier gas proceed from the center toward the peripheral of the rotating disk, a substantial amount of the reactants is consumed along the way, making the thin film deposited thinner and thinner along the radial direction upon the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to the present invention, growth efficiency is improved by using a comparatively high wafer carrier rotation rate, so that the centrifugal force generated by the rotation of the wafer carrier enhances the gas speed over the wafers without using higher gas flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, gas flow resistance can be reduced, so that a higher degree of laminar flow is produced, by forming the reaction gas outlet(s) such that they are entirely above the upper surface of the wafer carrier. By forming the gas outlet entirely above the upper surface of the wafer carrier <b>116</b>, a more direct route (and thus less contorted) for the reaction gas from the gas inlet <b>112</b> to the gas outlet <b>119</b> is provided. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the more direct and the less contorted the route of the reaction gas, the less turbulent (and more laminar) its flow will be.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">By adding a ring seal <b>132</b> around the rotating wafer carrier <b>116</b> to bridge the flow channel <b>130</b> of the exhaust gas flow, flow resistance is reduced and laminar flow substantially enhanced. This is because a change of gas flow direction at the wafer carrier's edge is eliminated. The ring seal <b>132</b> can be made of quartz, graphite, SiC or other durable materials for suitable for the reactor's environment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In order to achieve even pumping of exhaust gas (and thus more laminar flow), a ring shaped diffuser <b>133</b> (better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) can be used. The ring shaped diffuser <b>133</b> effectively makes almost the entire periphery of the reactor, proximate the periphery of the wafer carrier <b>132</b>, one generally continuous gas outlet port.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A heater <b>117</b> is disposed outside of the chamber (which is that portion of the reactor within which reaction gas readily flows). The heater is disposed beneath the wafer carrier <b>116</b>. Since the ring seal <b>132</b> mitigates reaction gas flow beneath the wafer carrier <b>116</b>, the heater is not substantially exposed to reaction gas and thus is not substantially degraded thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Preferably, a heater purge <b>146</b> is provided so as to purge any reaction gas that leaks past the ring seal <b>132</b> into the area beneath the wafer carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, four pumping ports or gas outlets <b>119</b> are in fluid communication with the diffuser <b>133</b>. All of the gas outlets <b>119</b> are preferably connected to a common pump.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The ring seal <b>132</b> bridges the gap between the wafer carrier <b>116</b> and the chamber <b>111</b>, so as to facilitate laminar flow of reaction gas, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the diffuser <b>133</b> comprises a plurality of inner apertures <b>136</b> and a plurality of outer apertures <b>137</b>. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the greater the number of inner apertures <b>136</b> that there are, the more nearly the inner apertures approximate a single continuous opening. Of course, the more nearly the inner apertures approximate a single continuous opening, the more laminar the gas flow through the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The diffuser <b>133</b> preferably comprises at least as many outer apertures as there are gas outlet ports (there are, for example, four gas outlet ports <b>119</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The diffuser <b>133</b> is preferably made of graphite, SiC coated graphite, solid SiC, quartz, molybdenum, or other material that resist hot ammonia. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various materials are suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The size of the holes in the diffuser <b>133</b> can be made small enough to create slight restriction to the gas flow so that more even distribution to the exhaust can be achieve. However, the hole size should not be made so small that clogging is likely to occur, since reaction product contains vapor and solid particulate that may adhere to or condense upon the diffuser holes.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the reactant gas injection configuration can be modified to improve gas phase reaction. According to these modified configurations, alkyls and ammonia are mostly separated before being introduced into the reaction chamber as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and are completely separated before entering the reaction chamber as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In both cases, the reactants are mixed immediately before reaching the growth zone where wafers are located. Gas phase reaction only happens in a very short time before gases participate in the growth process.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an alkyl inlet <b>141</b> is separate from an ammonia inlet <b>142</b>. Both the alkyl inlet <b>141</b> and the ammonia inlet <b>142</b> provide a reaction gas to the carrier gas inlet <b>112</b> immediately prior to these gases entering the chamber <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the alkyl inlet <b>141</b> provides a reaction gas to the carrier inlet <b>112</b> much the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The ammonia inlet <b>151</b> comprises a tube disposed within the carrier inlet <b>112</b>. The ammonia inlet is preferably disposed generally concentrically within the carrier inlet <b>112</b>. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various other configurations of the alkyl inlet <b>141</b>, the ammonia inlet <b>151</b>, and the carrier inlet <b>112</b> are likewise suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A nozzle <b>161</b> tends to spread ammonia evenly across the wafer carrier <b>116</b> so as to provide enhance reaction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The reaction gas inlet configurations of both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> mitigate undesirable gas phase reactions prior to the reaction gases contacting the wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As mentioned above, an advantage of the reactor configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> is the significant reduction of undesirable deposits upon the heater <b>117</b>. The heater assembly can be either a radiant heater or a radio frequency (RF) inductive heater. By providing a heater purge <b>146</b> to the lower part of the reactor <b>111</b>, reaction gas can be effectively prevented from entering the heater region. Thus, any reaction gas leaks past the ring seal <b>132</b> is quickly purged from the heater region, such that deterioration of the heater <b>117</b> caused thereby is mitigated.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to one aspect, the present invention comprises a way to scale up the throughput of a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system or the like. Unlike contemporary attempts to scale up a MOCVD reactor by increasing the size of the reaction chamber, present invention integrates several smaller reactor modules to achieve the same wafer throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a twenty-one wafer reactor <b>900</b> is shown. Because of the large size of the reactor <b>900</b>, gas is usually introduced through multiple ports <b>901</b>-<b>903</b> so as to provide even distribution thereof. Gas flow controllers <b>902</b> facilitate control of the amount of reaction gas and the amounts of the components of the reaction gas provided to the chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A gas supply system <b>940</b> provides reaction gas to the ports <b>901</b>-<b>903</b>. A gas exhaust system <b>950</b> removes the spent reaction gas from the reactor <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an integrated three chamber reactor of the present invention is shown. Each chamber <b>951</b>-<b>953</b> is a comparatively small chamber, each defining, for example, a seven wafer reactor. All of the reactors share the same gas inlet system <b>960</b> and gas exhaust system <b>970</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Both the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> yield the same twenty-one wafer throughput. However, there are substantial advantages of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as compared to the reactor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Smaller reactors have better hardware reliability, especially for group III nitride growth, since smaller mechanical parts have lower thermal stress at high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, growth consistency is better achieved with smaller reactors, since temperature and flow dynamics are much easier to maintain than in larger reactors. Also, since construction of smaller reactor is much simpler than larger reactor, maintenance of smaller reactor is much easier and takes less time. Therefore, a smaller reactor usually has higher uptime, as well as less frequent and less expensive parts service.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">All of these factors result in much lower cost of ownership for small reactors, since real wafer yield is higher and maintenance cost is lower. Since the cost to build a reactor is only about 2-5% of a whole MOCVD system, adding multiple reactors in the system does not increase overall cost appreciably. The benefit of this invention is much greater than the cost of additional reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As discussed in detail above, the present invention comprises a chemical vapor deposition reaction chamber having a rotatable wafer carrier, a narrow flow channel, a gas inlet located at the center of the top lid, a gas exit above the wafer carrier, a sealing ring around the wafer carrier to facilitate flow laminarly to the exhaust and to define a heater chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">During the growth process (deposition), the wafer carrier is rotating, typically at hundreds of rpm, e.g., 500-1500 rpm, so as to facilitate faster gas flow in the flow channel via the use of centrifugal force. Reactants mixed with less reactive gases, such as nitrogen or hydrogen (carrier gases), are carried into the flow channel and result in deposition on the hot substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">However, a portion of the chemical reaction occurs sooner that desirable as the gas travels though the channel and a substantial portion, possibly most, of the reactants in the gas are consumed close to the gas inlet. A diminishing amount of the source gas is left as gas travels along the channel. This is known as depletion effect. The depletion effect is well known and commonly occurs in horizontal reactors, where gas travels from one end of the chamber horizontally to the other end of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In the case of GaN growth, the reactants used can be trimethylgallium (TMG) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), both of which can be carried by either hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) or nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). The supply of NH<sub>3 </sub>is much greater than the supply of TMG in a typical metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth process for GaN in order to prevent decomposition of GaN at the surface. This is the case for III-V compounds and III-nitride growth using MOCVD where group V gas supply is much greater than group III. Therefore the depletion effect that adversely affects growth uniformity is mostly due to the depletion of group III sources.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, according to at least one aspect of the present invention, the group III and group V gas inlets are separated. A top or lid <b>212</b> of a reactor <b>211</b> has an NH<sub>3 </sub>inlet <b>213</b> formed generally centrally therein. A plurality of group III injectors <b>214</b> are formed in the lid in a manner that defines a plurality of zones (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a plurality of separate zones <b>250</b> are defined by separate groupings of group III injectors <b>214</b>. Each grouping of injectors <b>214</b> is positioned within a dedicated one of the zones <b>250</b>. All of the injectors <b>214</b> of a given zone <b>250</b> can have common plumbing and the flow for each zone is separately controllable with respect to the flow through the injectors <b>214</b> of the other zones <b>250</b>. That is, the amount of gas flowing into each zone can be controlled by a dedicated flow controller so that any desired group III gas (source) distribution can be adjusted flexibly. Either the same gases or different gases can flow through the injectors of each grouping <b>214</b>. Thus, the flow rate for all of the injectors <b>214</b> can be approximately the same and the concentration of the group III reactants can be varied from zone to zone, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Three zones <b>250</b> and consequently three groups of injectors <b>214</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that any desired number of zones <b>250</b> and any desired number of groups of injectors <b>214</b> can be provided. Each zone <b>250</b> can contain any desired number of injectors <b>214</b>. Indeed, every single injector can define a zone and can be individually controlled with respect to what gases are injected therewith and the flow rate of injection. Thus, the configuration of zones <b>250</b> and injectors <b>214</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> and discussed herein is by way of example only, and not by way of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The lid <b>212</b> can comprise any desired number of injectors <b>214</b>. For example, the lid <b>212</b> can comprises <b>12</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>64</b>, or more injectors <b>214</b>. Further, each zone can contain any desired number of injectors <b>214</b>. For example, each zone can contain 4, 6, 8, 12, or more injectors <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">By keeping the group V gas inlet <b>213</b> at the center of the lid <b>212</b> and distributing the group III gas in a controlled manner over the entire lid <b>212</b>, laminar flow is established by the group V gas while eliminating the depletion effect of group III source. Much better deposition uniformity over the entire wafer carrier can be achieved. The wafer carrier can rotate at a rate of between approximately 10 rpm and approximately 1500 rpm. The pressure in the reactor can be less than or equal to approximately 760 torr.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Distributing group III gas over the entire lid <b>212</b> can be achieved by creating holes (injectors) in the lid. Water cooling of the group III injectors can also provided to prevent premature decomposition of the group III sources.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">It is understood that the exemplary method and apparatus for chemical vapor deposition described herein and shown in the drawings represents only presently preferred embodiments of the invention. Indeed, various modifications and additions may be made to such embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it should be appreciated that the apparatus and method of the present invention may find applications which are different from metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Indeed, the present invention may be suitable for application completely unrelated to the fabrication of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Thus, these and other modifications and additions may be obvious to those skilled in the art and may be implemented to adapt the present invention for use in a variety of different applications.</p>
