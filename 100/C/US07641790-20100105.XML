<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The inventive system described herein uses ultraviolet (&#x201c;UV&#x201d;) light emitting diode (LED) technology to disinfect drinking water in intermittently operated flow-through hydration systems, such as wearable bladder bags. In such systems, water generally flows intermittently and on-demand from a bladder bag, or other &#x201c;reservoir,&#x201d; through a tube and out into the user's mouth or, alternately, a drinking vessel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, most UV water treatment systems use low pressure cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) mercury vapor lamps with a primary radiative emission of 254 nanometers (2,537 angstroms). This wavelength, which falls within the short wave UV-C band, is highly germicidal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The CCFL UV lamps can be very effective in batch UV water purification systems, such as the system described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,900,212 and 6,110,424. However, the CCLF lamps are not well suited for wearable hydration systems. The lamps and their thermally insulating sleeves must be made from high quality, optical grade quartz, and thus, the CCFL UV lamp assemblies tend to be both costly and fragile. In addition, the CCFL UV lamps require high voltage AC power, and the circuitry needed to deliver this power is complex and relatively expensive, particularly if the input is from a DC source such as a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The lamps also require a significant &#x201c;warm-up&#x201d; period during which lamp output &#x201c;ramps up&#x201d; from zero to full power. During this &#x201c;ramp-up&#x201d; period, any water flowing past a CCFL UV lamp will not have predictable or uniform UV exposure. As a result, the efficacy of the treatment of water in such a flow-through system, from a micro-biological standpoint, becomes unpredictable and unreliable. For this reason, safety dictates that CCFL UV lamps be allowed to &#x201c;ramp-up&#x201d; to a steady-state output before water flow past the lamp is permitted. Achieving this steady-state output may take up to several minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a wearable flow-through hydration system or other intermittently operated on-demand flow-through systems, water consumption is not only intermittent but sudden and unpredictable. Accordingly, the CCFL UV lamps must, for safe operation, have been &#x201c;ramped-up&#x201d; to a steady state output before the water is allowed to flow past. The user must thus either keep the CCFL UV lamp on all the time or turn on the lamp for up to several minutes prior to each use, in order to allow for the &#x201c;ramp-up&#x201d; to steady state output. Neither of these scenarios is particularly desirable. In the first, the lamp must be kept on all the time and consumption of limited battery power quickly becomes a problem. In the second, the lamp must be turned on minutes before taking each drink and there is an obvious inconvenience.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is a wearable or portable intermittently operable hydration system in which a water purification module containing one or more solid state UV devices, such as UV LEDs, is positioned in the path of the flow of the hydrating fluid, such as water, from a container or reservoir through a tube or straw to a mouthpiece or other orifice. The purification module provides a path for the water past the one or more UV LEDs, which are turned on to subject the water to sufficient UV radiation to purify the water. The UV LEDs are &#x201c;instant on&#x201d; devices with essentially no ramp-up, and a sensor or switch situated in the flow path signals the UV LEDs to turn on whenever the user initiates water flow through the path.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The UV LEDs are DC devices, and thus, require simpler, lower cost drive and control circuitry, than is required to operate CCFL lamps. Further, the UV LEDs are solid state devices and are thus less fragile than the CCFL lamps. Accordingly, the UV LEDs are well suited for intermittently operated wearable or portable flow-through hydration devices, such as wearable bladders, user-carried or worn sports water bottles, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The DC power for the UV LEDs may be supplied by batteries, fuel cells and/or by solar cells, that is, photovoltaic panels, and the batteries and fuel cells and/or capacitors may be charged by solar cells. Further, a backpack that holds the system may be made from flexible photovoltaic material or material that supports or incorporates photovoltaic panels, and thus, provide power directly to the unit. Alternatively, the UV LEDs may be powered by windup or crank-type dynamos in addition to or in place of the batteries, cells and, in a black-out condition, grid power.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The purification module and associated water flow sensor may instead be positioned in a drinking straw, and thus, be used to purify water flowing through the straw from any type of water bottle, canteen and so forth, carried by the user. The purification module may additionally include a filter that removes sediment from the water. Alternatively, the purification module may be included in the tubing of a portable water filtering system, such as a pump system used by campers. The filter in such a system may then be relatively coarse, since the filter needs only to trap sediment and not microbes, which are destroyed by the purification module. Further, such a filtering system would not require use of chemicals. In addition, the pump action may be harnessed to power the UV LEDs, and batteries and the like may thus be eliminated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wearable flow-through hydration system <b>10</b> includes a bladder <b>12</b> that is contained in a backpack <b>14</b>. The bladder supplies hydrating fluids, such as water, to a user through a tube <b>16</b> and mouthpiece <b>18</b>. The tube includes a purification module <b>22</b> that ensures that the water is sufficiently irradiated by ultraviolet (&#x201c;UV&#x201d;) light in the germicidal range. As the water flows through the module <b>22</b>, the UV radiation destroys the DNA of the microbes present in the water, thereby preventing microbial reproduction, and therefore, infection. The purification module <b>22</b> is discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When a user requires water from the bladder <b>12</b>, the water is drawn out of the bladder and flows past a water flow sensor <b>20</b>. When the water flow sensor senses the flow, the sensor switches on the purification module <b>22</b>. A power supply <b>24</b> supplies between 6 and 9 volts DC power to the purification module, and as discussed in more detail below, one or more solid state UV device, such as, UV light emitting diodes (&#x201c;LEDs&#x201d;), turn on to irradiate the water as the water flows through the purification module.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the purification module <b>22</b> includes an LED unit <b>30</b> that preferably contains a plurality of UV LEDs (not shown individually). The module <b>22</b> is positioned in the tube <b>16</b> such that water flows on paths <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>largely surrounding the unit <b>30</b>. The dimensions of the purification module <b>22</b> and the associated section of the tube <b>16</b> are such that water flowing past and at a maximum distance away from the UV LEDs receives energy of at least 25 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in the drawings, the module <b>22</b> is widened where the LED unit <b>30</b> resides, such that water flow is not impeded by having to flow around, that is, on the paths <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>on either side of, the LED unit. This prevents a backing up or other interruption of the water flow through the tube <b>16</b> to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unlike CCFL UV lamps, UV LEDs are &#x201c;instant on&#x201d; devices meaning that UV output reaches steady state in micro or nanoseconds. Also, unlike fragile CCFL UV lamps, UV LEDs are robust solid state devices which do not require low pressure gas mixtures that can leak and fail. In addition, UV LEDs are DC devices which require simple, low cost drive and control circuitry, as compared with the much more expensive and involved high voltage ballast circuitry of CCFL lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a wearable flow-through hydration system, where water is drawn periodically and unpredictably, UV LED based purification has a further advantage over CCFL UV systems. With &#x201c;instant on&#x201d; and no need for a &#x201c;ramp-up&#x201d; period, and thus, the LEDs can be activated only as needed, i.e., while water is being drawn. When water is not being drawn, the LEDs are off and no power is consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A &#x201c;drinking straw&#x201d; embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A flow-through purification module <b>32</b> is connected in line between the mouthpiece <b>33</b> and the tailpiece <b>34</b> of a drinking straw generally indicated at <b>35</b>. The module is of the same construction as the module <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, with an attached power supply <b>36</b>. A flow sensor <b>37</b> is disposed below the module <b>32</b>. In the illustration the drinking straw has been inserted through the cover <b>38</b> of a container <b>40</b> containing a liquid such as water. The user imbibes the liquid as she would through a conventional drinking straw, with the &#x201c;instant on&#x201d; feature of the purifier module purifying the water on-demand as the water flows through the module.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> a purification module <b>50</b> has been combined with a bottle top <b>52</b> that contains a power supply (not shown) in a cavity <b>52</b><i>a</i>. The upper end of the module <b>52</b> terminates in a &#x201c;push-pull&#x201d; valve <b>53</b> of the type often used by cyclists, hikers, etc. The lower end of the module, which extends into the bottle <b>54</b> to which the top <b>52</b> is attached, may carry an optional filter <b>56</b> for removal of particles entrained in the water entering the module <b>50</b>. The sensor <b>58</b> may be eliminated, and the push-pull operation of the valve <b>53</b> may instead be used to control the turning on of the UV LEDs, with the pulling or opening of the valve turning on the purification module.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a purification module <b>60</b> in use in a portable water filtration system <b>62</b>, such as those used by campers. The purification unit destroys microbes in the water that is pumped through the system via pump <b>64</b>, while one or more filters <b>66</b> remove sediments from the water. The pump action may also provide power to the UV LEDs through the power supply <b>68</b>, which operates in a known manner to convert pumping action to DC power. In such a filtration system, a water flow sensor is not required, since the power supply utilizes pumping action and thus does not provide power to the UV LEDs unless the pump is operated to draw water through the system. The one or more filters need not be as fine as those used in conventional water filtration systems, since the filters need not trap the microbes, which are instead destroyed by the UV radiation. Further, the water filtration system does not require the chemicals used in conventional filtration systems.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The power supplies discussed above may include conventional batteries or solar cells, that is, photovotaic panels. Alternatively, the power supply may include batteries, fuel cells or capacitors that are charged by solar cells, and/or windup or crank-type dynamos. Further, the backpack <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that holds the system may be made from flexible photovoltaic material or made of material that supports or incorporates the photovoltaic panels, and thus, provide power directly to the unit. Similarly, a carrier (not shown) for the bottle <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be made from, support or incorporate photovoltaic material. In addition or instead, the bottle top <b>52</b> may be made relatively inflexible photovoltaic material or support one or more photovoltaic panels. Alternatively, the UV LEDs may be powered by windup or crank-type dynamos (not shown) in addition to or in place of the batteries, cells and, in a black-out condition, grid power.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when solar cells are used, the power supply <b>80</b> preferably includes a current shunt <b>82</b> that is coupled to a microcontroller <b>84</b>, for measuring the current supplied to the UV LEDs and calculating the UV dose, which is proportional to the current. When there are fluctuations in solar energy, such as when a cloud covers the sun, the microcontroller may impede the flow of the water, to provide longer periods of exposure to the UV radiation by controlling the amount by which a valve <b>86</b> opens to allow water flow past the UV LEDs in unit <b>88</b>. The microcontroller may instead prevent the water from flowing through the purification module until sufficient current can be supplied. As appropriate, the unit may be switched from, for example, solar power to backup battery power at appropriate times by the microcontroller and/or the user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the LED unit <b>22</b> may instead be positioned in the narrowing channel <b>13</b> that connects the bladder <b>12</b> to the tubing <b>16</b>, with the UV LEDs turning on when water flows through the channel. Alternatively or in addition, UV LEDs <b>90</b> may be positioned facing inwardly in the walls <b>92</b> of the bladder or in the area proximate to the channel <b>13</b> to supply UV radiation to the water held in the bladder. The UV LEDs in the walls may, for example, be turned on when associated solar cells have stored sufficient energy, as a precaution against changing environmental conditions that might otherwise disrupt the power to the UV LEDs. As appropriate, the treated water may then flow through the purification module as discussed above and be subject to further UV radiation, assuming the solar cells are sufficiently charged. Alternatively, the water may be diverted around the unit or flow through the unit without further treatment. A similar arrangement and operation of the wall-mounted UV LEDs may be used in the water bottle <b>54</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiments described above, the water flow sensors may be replaced with user-activated switches that a user turns on to activate the UV LEDs in the LED unit <b>30</b> when, for example, the user desires to take a drink. Further, automatic or user-activated switches may be included to actuate the UV LEDs <b>90</b> in the walls of the containers at desired times, such as when sufficient solar power is available or it is convenient for the user to operate a dynamo, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In summary, the UV LED purification system described above has numerous advantages. The UV LED purification system is less costly, more robust, less complicated, more convenient, and less power-consuming. It also has the potential to be smaller and lighter than CCFL technology. Further, the UV LED purification system is particularly well suited for intermittent on-demand use. Accordingly, the system is well suited for use in wearable or portable hydration devices.</p>
