<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention generally relates to metallurgical casting and treatment processes, and more specifically to an integrated metal processing facility and method of heat treating castings.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, in conventional processes for forming metal castings, a mold such as a metal die or sand mold having an interior chamber with the exterior features of a desired casting defined therein, is filled with a molten metal. A sand core that defines interior features of the casting is received and or positioned within the mold to form the interior detail of the casting as the molten metal solidifies about the core. After the molten metal of the casting has solidified, the casting generally is thereafter moved to a treatment furnace(s) for heat treatment of the castings, removal of sand from the sand cores and/or molds, and other processes as required. The heat treatment processes condition the metal or metal alloys of the castings so that they will be provided with desired physical characteristics suited for different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, during the transfer of the castings from the pouring station to a heat treatment station, and especially if the castings are allowed to sit for any appreciable amount of time, the castings are generally exposed to the ambient environment of the foundry or metal processing facility. As a result, the castings tend to begin to rapidly cool down from a molten or semi-molten temperature. While some cooling of the castings is necessary to cause the castings to solidify, the present inventors/applicants have found that the more that the temperature of the castings drops and the longer the castings remain below a process critical or process control temperature of the castings, the more heat treatment time within the heat treatment furnace that is required to both heat the castings back up to a desired heat treatment temperature and hold the castings at said temperature for heat treating the castings to achieve the desired physical properties thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has been found that for certain types of metals, for every minute of time that the casting drops below its process control temperature, as much as 4 minutes or more of extra heat treatment time is required to achieve the desired process. Thus, even dropping below for as little as ten minutes below the process control temperature of the metal of the castings can require as much as 40+ minutes of extra heat treatment time to achieve the desired treated physical properties. Typically, therefore, those castings are heat treated for at least 2-6 hours, and in some cases longer, to achieve the desired heat treatment effects. As a consequence, however, the longer the heat treatment time and the more heat required to properly and completely heat treat the castings, the greater the cost of the heat treatment process and the greater the waste of heat and energy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Attempts have been made to shorten the distance between the pouring and heat treatment stations to try to reduce the loss of heat. For example, the Mercedes unit of Daimler Benz in Germany has placed a heat treatment furnace close to the take off or transfer points of a carousel type pouring station. As the castings reach a take-off point where they are removed from their dies, they generally are transported to a basket or carrier for collection of a batch of castings. The castings are then introduced into a heat treatment furnace for batch processing. The problem with this system is that it still fails to address the problem of the castings being subjected to the ambient environment, which generally is at temperatures much lower than the desired process control temperature of the castings, both during the transfer of the castings to a collection basket and while the castings sit in the basket awaiting introduction into the heat treatment furnace. This idle time can still be as much as 10 minutes or more depending upon the processing rates of the pouring and heat treatment stations. However, it is also important for the castings to be cooled and maintained at a temperature at or below the heat treatment temperature of the casting metal(s) for at least some desired time, in order to enable the castings to properly solidify prior to heat treatment. Thus, moving the castings from pouring to heat treatment too quickly can disrupt the formation of the castings and prevent them from properly solidifying.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is, therefore, a desire in the industry to enhance the process of heat treating castings, such that a continuing need exists for a more efficient method and system or facility to enable more efficient heat treatment and processing of metal castings, and further potentially enable more efficient sand core and/or sand mold removal and reclamation.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Briefly described, the present invention generally comprises an integrated metal processing facility for pouring, forming, heat treating and further processing castings formed from metals or metal alloys. The integrated metal processing facility generally includes a pouring station at which a molten metal such as aluminum or iron, or a metal alloy, is poured into a mold or die, such as a permanent metal mold, semi permanent molds, or a sand mold. The molds then are transitioned from a pouring or casting position of the pouring station to a transfer position, whereupon the casting is either removed from its mold, or the mold, with the casting contained therewithin, is then transferred to a heat treatment line by a transfer mechanism. The transfer mechanism typically will include a robotic arm, crane, overhead hoist or lift, pusher, conveyor or similar conveying mechanism. In some embodiments, the same mechanism also can be used to remove the castings from their molds and transfer the castings to the heat treatment line. During this transition from pouring to the transfer position or point and/or to the heat treatment line, the molten metal of the castings is permitted to cool to an extent sufficient to enable the metal to solidify to form the castings therewithin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The heat treatment line or unit generally includes a process temperature control station and a heat treatment station or furnace typically having one or more furnace chambers, and, in some embodiments, a quench station generally located downstream from the heat treatment station. The process temperature control station generally is formed as an elongated chamber or tunnel through which the castings are received prior to their introduction into the heat treatment station. The chamber of the process temperature control station typically includes a series of heat sources, such as radiant heaters, infrared, inductive, convection, conduction, or other types of heating elements mounted therealong so as to supply heat to create a heated environment therewithin. The walls and ceiling of the process temperature control station further typically are formed with or have a radiant material applied thereto, which material will tend to radiate or direct heat toward the castings and/or molds as they are passed through the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As the castings and/or the molds with the castings therein are received within and pass along the chamber of the process temperature control station, the cooling of the castings is arrested at or above a process control temperature. The process control temperature generally is a temperature below the solution heat-treat temperature required for the metal of the castings, such that the castings are cooled to a sufficient amount or extent to enable them to solidify, but below which the time required to raise the castings up to their solution heat treatment temperature and thereafter heat-treat the castings is exponentially increased. The castings are maintained at or above their process control temperature as they are passed along the process temperature control station prior to introduction into the heat treatment station.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, a series of heat sources, including radiant heating elements such as infrared and inductive heating elements, convection, conduction or other types of heat sources can be positioned along the path of travel of the castings as they are transferred from the pouring station to the heat treatment line for feeding into the heat treatment station. For such an embodiment, the process temperature control station can be replaced with a series of heat sources mounted along the path of travel of the castings from the pouring station to the heat treatment furnace so as to direct heat, such as through the flow of heated air or other media, at the castings or molds as the castings or molds are fed from the pouring station into the heat treatment station. In addition, a heating element or heat source can be mounted directly to the transfer mechanism in a position so as to direct a flow of heat at or against the castings and/or the sand molds with the castings contained therein. Thus, the cooling of the castings below their process control temperature will be arrested by the application of heat directly from the transfer mechanism itself during the transfer and introduction of the castings from the pouring station directly into the heat treatment station.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By arresting the cooling of the castings and thereafter maintaining the castings at a temperature that is substantially at or above the process control temperature for the metal of the castings, the time required for the heat treatment of the castings can be significantly reduced as the castings can be rapidly brought up to a solution heat treatment temperature within a relatively short period of time after their introduction into the heat treatment station or furnace. Accordingly, the output of the pouring station for the castings can be increased, and thus the overall processing and heat treatment times for the castings can be enhanced or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As the castings are passed through the heat treatment station, they are maintained or soaked at a solution heat treatment temperature for a desired length of time as needed to completely and sufficiently heat treat the metal of the castings and for the breakdown and reclamation of the sand of the sand cores and sand molds of the castings. Thereafter, the castings can be passed through a quenching station, and further can be passed through an aging station for aging and additional treatment and processing of the casting.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now in greater detail to the drawings in which like numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-3</figref> schematically illustrate an integrated metal processing facility or system <b>5</b> and method of processing metallurgical castings. Metal casting processes are generally well known to those skilled in the art and a traditional casting process will be described only briefly for reference purposes. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention can be used in any type of casting process, including metal casting processes for forming aluminum, iron, steel and/or other types of metal and metal alloy castings. The present invention thus is not and should not be limited solely for use with a particular casting process or a particular type or types of metals or metal alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, typically, a molten metal or metallic alloy M is poured into a die or mold <b>10</b> at a pouring or casting station <b>11</b> for form a casting <b>12</b>, such as a cylinder head or engine block or similar cast part. Typically, casting cores <b>13</b> formed from sand and an organic binder, such as a phenolic resin, are received or placed within the molds <b>10</b>, so as create hollow cavities and/or casting details or core prints within the castings being formed within each mold. Each of the molds further can be a permanent, metal mold or die, typically formed from a metal such as steel, cast iron or other material as is known in the art, and having a clam-shell style design for ease of opening and removal of the casting therefrom. Alternatively, the molds can include &#x201c;precision sand mold&#x201d; type molds and/or &#x201c;green sand molds&#x201d;, which molds generally are formed from a sand material such as silica sand or zircon sand, mixed with a binder such as a phenolic resin or other binder as is known in the art, similar to the sand casting cores <b>13</b>. The molds further can include semi-permanent sand molds, which typically have an outer mold wall formed from sand and a binder material, a metal such as steel, or a combination of both types of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be understood that the term &#x201c;mold&#x201d; will hereafter will generally be used to refer to all types of molds as discussed above, including permanent or metal dies, semi-permanent and precision sand mold type molds, and other metal casting molds except where a particular type mold is indicated. It further will be understood that in the various embodiments discussed below, unless a particular type of mold and/or heat treatment process is indicated, the present invention can be used for heat treating castings that have been removed from their permanent molds, or which remain within a sand mold for the combined heat treatment and sand mold break-down and sand reclamation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, each of the molds <b>10</b> generally includes side walls <b>14</b>, an upper wall or top <b>16</b>, a lower wall or bottom <b>17</b>, which collectively define an internal cavity <b>18</b> in which the molten metal is received and formed into the casting <b>12</b>. A pour opening <b>19</b> generally is formed in the upper wall or top <b>16</b> of each mold and communicates with the internal cavity for passage of the molten metal through each mold and into its internal cavity <b>18</b> at the pouring station <b>11</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the pouring station <b>11</b> generally includes a ladle or similar mechanism <b>21</b> for pouring the molten metal M into the molds and a conveyor <b>22</b>, such as a carousel, piston, indexing or similar conveying mechanism, that moves one or more molds from a pouring or casting position, indicated by <b>23</b>, at which the molten metal is poured into the molds, to a transfer point or position, indicated by <b>24</b>, at which the castings are removed from their molds, or at which the molds with their castings therein are transferred from the pouring station to a heat treatment unit <b>26</b> or line for heat treatment. After the molten metal has been poured into its mold, the mold is conveyed to the transfer position, during which the metal is allowed to cool to a desired extent or temperature within the die as needed to enable the metal to solidify into the casting, after which the casting can be heat treated at a desired heat treatment temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the present Inventors have discovered, as the metal of the casting is cooled down, it reaches a process control temperature, below which the time required to both raise the castings back up to the heat treating temperature and perform the heat treatments is significantly increased. This process control temperature varies depending upon the metal and/or metal alloy being used to form the casting, ranging from temperatures of approximately 400&#xb0; C. or lower for some alloys or metals, up to approximately 1000&#xb0; C.-1300&#xb0; C. or greater for other alloys of metals such as iron. For example, for aluminum/copper alloys, the process control temperature generally can range from about 400&#xb0; C. to 470&#xb0; C., which temperatures generally are below solution heat treatment temperatures for most copper alloys, which typically range from approximately 475&#xb0; C. to approximately 495&#xb0; C. While a casting is within its process control temperature range, it has been found that the casting typically will be cooled to a level sufficient to allow its metal to solidify as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, it further has been discovered by the present Inventors that when the metal of the casting is permitted to cool below its process control temperature, it will be necessary to heat the casting for approximately an additional 4 minutes or more for each minute that the metal of the casting is cooled below the process control temperature thereof, in order to raise and maintain the temperature of the casting at a desired heat treatment temperature, such as for example, 475&#xb0; C. to 495&#xb0; C. for aluminum/copper alloys, or up to 510&#xb0; C. to 570&#xb0; C. for aluminum/magnesium alloys, so that heat treating can be performed. Thus, if the castings are permitted to cool below their process control temperature for even a short time, the time required to properly and completely heat treat the castings thereafter will be significantly increased. In addition, it should be recognized that in a batch processing type system, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D, where several castings are being processed through the heat treatment station in a single batch, the heat treatment times for the entire batch of castings generally are based upon the heat treatment times required for the casting(s) with the lowest temperature in the batch. As a result, if one of the castings in the batch of castings being processed has been cooled to below its process control temperature for approximately 10 minutes, for example, the entire batch typically will be subjected to approximately 40 minutes or more of additional heat treatment time in order to ensure that all of the castings are properly and completely heat treated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention therefore is directed to an integrated processing facility or system <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-3</figref>) and methods of processing metal castings that are designed to move and/or transition the castings (within or apart from their molds) from the pouring station <b>11</b> to the heat treatment system or unit <b>26</b>, with the cooling of the molten metal of the casting being arrested approximately at or above the process control temperature of the metal of the castings, but below or equal to the desired heat treatment temperatures thereof so as to accommodate the necessary solidification cooling of the castings and enable more efficient and shorter heat treatment times for the castings. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the process control temperature for the castings being processed by the present invention will vary depending upon the particular metal and/or metal alloys being used for the castings. It will therefore also be understood that while the process control temperature for many metal and metal alloys generally will be within a range of approximately 400&#xb0; C. for metals such as aluminum, up to approximately 1300&#xb0; C. or greater for metals such as iron, greater or lesser temperatures also can be accommodated depending upon the casting material being processed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A first embodiment of the integrated facility <b>5</b> and process for moving and/or processing castings therethrough is illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 3</figref> further illustrate an additional, alternative embodiment of the integrated facility <b>5</b> and process for forming and treating castings where the castings are being collected and processed through heat treatment in a batch processing type arrangement. It will, however, be understood by those skilled in the art that the principles of the present invention can be applied equally to batch type and continuous processing type facilities in which the castings are processed individually through the facility and therefore the present invention. The embodiments described hereinafter therefore are not and should not be limited solely to continuous or batch-type processing facilities. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref> further illustrate alternative embodiments of the present invention for performing additional processing steps such as chill removal from castings (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) or feeding the castings to multiple heat treatment furnaces (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). In addition, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various features of the embodiments discussed hereafter and illustrated in the drawings can be combined to form additional embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, the castings <b>12</b> generally are removed from their molds <b>10</b> at the transfer or pouring station <b>11</b> by a transfer mechanism <b>27</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the transfer system or mechanism <b>27</b> typically includes a robotic arm or crane, indicated at <b>28</b>, although it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other systems and devices for moving the castings and/or molds, such as an overhead boom or hoist, conveyor, pusher rods, or other similar material handling mechanisms, also can be used. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b>A, the robotic arm <b>28</b> of the transfer mechanism generally includes an engaging or gripping portion or clamp <b>29</b> for engaging and holding the molds or castings, and a base <b>31</b> on which the arm <b>28</b> is pivotally mounted so as to be movable between the transfer point <b>24</b> of the pouring station and the heat treatment line as indicated by arrows <b>32</b> and <b>32</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the transfer mechanism can be used to transfer molds and/or castings from multiple pouring stations <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>&#x2032; and can transfer the molds and/or castings to multiple heat treatment lines or units <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The molds with their castings therein, typically are moved from the pouring station <b>11</b> to the pickup or transfer point <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> whereupon the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> generally will pick up the molds with their castings contained therein, or will remove the castings <b>12</b> from their molds and transport the castings to the heat treatment unit <b>26</b>. Thus, the same manipulator or transfer mechanism can be used for removing the castings from the pouring station and for introducing the castings to the heat treatment unit. Typically, a heat source or heating element <b>33</b> will be positioned adjacent the transfer point <b>28</b> for the castings for applying heat thereto. The heat source typically can include any type of heating element or source such as conductive, radiant, infrared, conductive, convective and direct impingement types of heat sources. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, multiple heat sources <b>33</b> can be used, positioned so as to most effectively apply heat to the castings during a transfer operation from the pouring station to the heat treatment line.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Typically, in the case of permanent or metal dies or molds, the molds will be opened at the transfer point and the castings removed by the transfer mechanism, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. The transfer mechanism then transfers the castings to one or more inlet conveyors <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2A</figref>) of the heat treatment unit, line(s) or system(s) <b>26</b> of the integrated processing facility <b>5</b>. As the molds are opened and the castings removed, the heat sources <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) apply heat directly to the castings to arrest or otherwise control the cooling of the castings during their exposure to the ambient environment of the foundry or plant, as the castings are being transferred to the heat treatment unit, so as to maintain the castings approximately at or above the process control temperature of the metal of the castings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the processing of castings that are being formed in semi-permanent or sand molds in which the castings typically remain within their molds during heat treatment, during which the molds are broken down by the thermal degradation of the binder material holding the sand of the mold, the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> will transfer the entire mold with the casting contained therein, from the transfer point to the inlet conveyor <b>34</b>. The heat sources <b>33</b> thus will continue to apply heat to the mold itself, with the amount of heat applied being controlled to maintain the temperature of the castings inside the mold at levels approximately at or above the process control temperature of the metal of the castings without causing excessive or premature degradation of the molds.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, when reference is made to transport, heating, treating, or otherwise moving or processing the &#x201c;castings&#x201d;, except where otherwise indicated, it will be understood that such discussion includes both the removal and processing of the castings by themselves, without their molds, and processes wherein the castings remain in their sand molds for heat treatment, mold and core breakdown, and sand reclamation as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,294,994; 5,565,046; 5,738,162, and 6,217,317 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/665,354, filed Sep. 9, 2000, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, the castings initially are indexed or conveyed by the inlet conveyor <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>), or conveyors <b>34</b> and <b>34</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) into a pre-chamber or process temperature control station or module <b>36</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the process temperature control station or module generally includes a heated inner chamber <b>37</b> through which the castings and/or molds with the castings therein are conveyed along their processing path along the heat treatment line on a chain conveyor, rollers or similar conveying mechanism <b>38</b>. The castings enter the chamber <b>37</b> at an upstream or inlet end <b>39</b>, and exit the chamber <b>37</b> through a downstream or outlet end <b>41</b> and generally are introduced directly into a heat treatment furnace or station <b>42</b> of the heat treatment line <b>26</b>. The inlet and outlet ends <b>39</b> and <b>41</b> of the process temperature control station further can be open, or can include doors or similar closure structures, such as indicated at <b>43</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, to help seal the chamber <b>37</b> to avoid undue loss of heat therein. Typically, the castings will be fed directly from the process temperature control station <b>36</b> into the heat treatment station <b>42</b>, with the heat treatment and process temperature control stations thus being linked together to further avoid potential loss of heat and possibly enable sharing of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The chamber <b>37</b> generally is a radiant chamber and includes a series of heat sources <b>45</b> mounted therewithin, including being positioned along the walls <b>46</b> and/or ceiling <b>47</b> of the chamber. Typically, multiple heat sources <b>45</b> will be used and can comprise one or more various different types of heat sources or heating elements, including radiant heating sources such as infrared, electromagnetic or inductive energy sources, conductive, convective, and direct impingement type heat sources, such as gas fired burner tubes introducing a gas flame into the chamber. In addition, the side walls and ceiling of the radiant chamber <b>37</b> generally are formed from or are coated with a high temperature radiant material, such as a metal, metallic film or similar material, ceramic, or composite material capable of radiating heat and which generally forms a non-stick surface on the walls and ceilings. As a result, as the walls and ceiling of the chamber are heated, the walls and ceiling tend to radiate heat toward the castings, while at the same time their surfaces generally are heated to a temperature sufficient to burn off waste gases and residue such as soot, etc., from the combustion of the binders of the sand molds and/or cores to prevent collection and buildup thereof on the walls and ceiling of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-6B</figref> illustrate various different embodiments of the process temperature control station. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> illustrate the process temperature control station <b>36</b> utilizing convection type heat sources <b>45</b>. Each of the convection heat sources generally includes one or more nozzles or blowers <b>51</b> connected to a source of heated media by conduits <b>52</b>. The blowers <b>51</b> are arranged or positioned about the ceiling <b>47</b> and side walls <b>46</b> of the chamber <b>37</b> so as to direct a heated media such as air or other gases, and/or fluids into the chamber and against the castings and/or molds contained therein. The convection blowers generally tend to create a turbulent heated fluid flow about the castings, as indicated by arrows <b>53</b>, as to apply heat substantially to all sides of the castings and/or sand molds. As a result, the castings are substantially uniformly bathed in the heated media so as to thus maintain the temperature of the castings approximately at or above the process control temperature of the metal thereof. In addition, where the castings are processed in their sand molds, the application of heat within the process temperature control station tends to heat the molds themselves, raising their temperature towards a decomposition or combustion temperature at which the binder materials therein start to combust, pyrolyze or otherwise be driven off.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is also possible to have the blowers or nozzles <b>52</b> at the front of the process temperature control station adjacent the inlet end thereof, operating at higher velocities and/or temperatures to try to more quickly arrest the cooling of the castings and/or molds. The nozzles or blowers <b>52</b> positioned toward the middle and/or end of the chamber, such as at the outlet, of the process temperature control station can be run at lower temperatures and velocities so as to maintain a desired temperature level of the castings and/or sand molds to prevent complete degradation of the sand molds while still in the process temperature control station and to enable the solidification of the castings to be completed prior to heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>&#x2032; in which the heat sources <b>45</b>&#x2032; generally comprise one or more radiant heaters <b>54</b>, such as infrared heating elements, electromagnetic energy sources, or similar radiant heating sources. Typically, the radiant heaters <b>54</b> will be arranged in multiple positions or sets at desired locations and orientations about the walls and ceiling <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> of the radiant chamber <b>37</b> of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>, similar to the arrangement of the convection blowers <b>51</b>. As with the convection heat sources <b>52</b>, the radiant heaters adjacent the inlet end of the chamber can be operated at higher temperatures to more quickly arrest the cooling of the castings in their sand molds as they enter the process temperature control station. In addition, vacuum blowers, pumps or exhaust fans/systems <b>56</b> generally are connected to the radiant chamber through conduits <b>57</b> and create a negative pressure within the radiant chamber <b>37</b>, so as to draw off heat and/or waste gases generated from the burning or combustion of the binder of the sand cores and/or sand molds within the chamber to help cool and prevent overheating of the elements of the radiant heaters.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still a further alternative embodiment of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>&#x2033; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, which illustrate a direct impingement type of heating source <b>45</b>&#x2033;. The direct impingement heat source includes a series of burners or nozzles <b>58</b> arranged in sets or arrays at selected positions or orientations within the radiant chamber <b>37</b>. These burners <b>58</b> are generally connected to a fuel source, such as natural gas or the like, by conduits <b>59</b>. The nozzles or burner elements of the direct impingement heat source direct and apply heat substantially toward the sides, the top, and the bottom of the castings. The castings are thus substantially uniformly heated, and the sand material released therefrom further can be exposed to direct heating for burning off of the binder material thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It further will be understood by those skilled in the art that these different heating sources can be combined for use in the radiant chamber. Further, multiple chambers can be used in series for arresting the cooling of the castings at or above the process control temperature therefor and thereafter maintaining the temperature of the castings as they are queued for input into the heat treatment station.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition to the use of various types of heat sources, it is further possible as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to direct and/or recuperate off-gases generated and captured during the pouring of the molten metal material into their molds in the pouring station <b>11</b>, into the radiant chamber of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>60</b>, in order to allow for shared heating and recuperation of energy from the heating of the metal for the castings. Alternatively, excess heat generated as a result of the break-down and combustion of the binder for the sand cores of the castings and/or sand molds within the heat treatment station <b>42</b> and the heat treatment of the castings also can be routed back to the process temperature control station, as indicated by dashed arrows <b>61</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in order to help heat the interior environment of the radiant chamber of the process temperature control station. Such recapture of waste gases and heat helps reduce the amount of energy required to heat the chamber of the process temperature control station to a desired or necessary temperature to arrest the cooling of the castings passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As additionally indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A and <b>6</b>A, a collection hopper or chute <b>62</b> generally is formed along the bottom of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>, positioned below the radiant chamber <b>37</b> thereof. This hopper <b>62</b> generally includes side walls <b>63</b> that slope downwardly at the lower ends <b>64</b> thereof. The sloping side walls collect sand dislodged from the sand cores of the castings and/or sand molds as the thermal degradation of the binder thereof begins within the process temperature control station. The sand typically is directed downwardly to a collection conveyor <b>66</b> positioned below the open lower end of the hopper <b>62</b>. Typically, a fluidizing system or mechanism <b>67</b> is positioned along lower portions <b>64</b> of the walls of the hopper <b>62</b>. The fluidizer(s) typically includes burners, blowers, distributors or similar fluidizing units, such as disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,294,994; 5,565,046; and 5,738,162, incorporated herein by reference, that apply a flow of a heated media such as air or other fluids to the sand to promote further degradation of the binder to help break up any clumps of sand and binder that may be dislodged from the castings to help reclaim the sand of the sand cores and/or sand molds for the castings in a substantially pure form. The reclaimed sand is collected on the conveyor <b>66</b> and conveyed away from the process temperature control station.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A, and <b>6</b>A, excess heat and waste gases generated by the combustion of the binder materials for the sand cores and/or sand molds of the castings can be collected or drawn out of the radiant chamber <b>37</b> of the process temperature control station <b>36</b> and routed into the heat treatment station <b>42</b> as indicated by arrows <b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. This channeling of excess heat and waste gases from the process temperature control station into the heat treatment station enables both the potential recouping of heat generated within the chamber of the process temperature control station and the further heating and/or combustion of waste gases resulting from the degradation of the binders of the sand molds and/or cores within the heat treatment chamber. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, blowers or similar air distribution mechanisms <b>69</b> further generally are mounted along the heat treatment station and typically will draw off waste gases generated during the heat treatment of the castings and the resulting burn-off of the binder materials from the sand cores and/or sand molds of the castings. These waste gases are collected by the blowers and typically are routed to an incinerator <b>71</b> for further treating and burning these waste gases to reprocess these gases and reduce the amount of pollution produced by the casting and heat treatment process. It is also possible to utilize filters to further filter the waste gases coming from either the process temperature control station prior to their being introduced into the heat treatment station and/or or for filtering gases coming from the heat treatment station to the incinerator.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The process temperature control station consequently functions as a nesting area in front of the heat treatment station or chamber in which the castings can be maintained with the temperature thereof being maintained or arrested at or above the process control temperature, but below a desired heat treating temperature while they await introduction into the heat treatment station. Thus, the system enables the pouring line or lines to be operated at a faster or more efficient rate without the castings having to sit in a queue or line waiting to be fed into the heat treatment station while exposed to the ambient environment, resulting in the castings cooling down below their process control temperature. The castings thereafter can be fed individually, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, or in batches, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>1</b>C and <b>3</b>, into the heat treatment station <b>42</b> for heat treatment, sand core and/or sand mold breakdown and removal, and possibly for sand reclamation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The heat treatment station <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) typically is an elongated furnace that includes one or more furnace chambers <b>75</b> mounted in series, through which a conveyor <b>76</b> is extended for transport of the castings therethrough. Heat sources <b>77</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) including convection heat sources such as blowers or nozzles that apply heated media such as air or other fluids, conduction heat sources such as a fluidized bed, inductive, radiant and/or other types of heat sources will be mounted within the walls and/or ceiling of the chamber <b>75</b> for providing heat and possibly an airflow about the castings in varying degrees and amounts in order to heat the castings to the proper heat treating temperatures for the metal thereof. Such desired heat treating temperatures and heat treatment times will vary according to the type of metal or metal alloy from which the castings are being formed, as will be known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An example of a heat treatment furnace for the heat treatment and at least partial breakdown and removal of the sand cores and/or sand molds of the castings, and possibly for reclamation of the sand from the sand cores and molds is illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,294,994; 5,565,046; and 5,738,162, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A further example of a heat treatment furnace or station for use with the present invention is illustrated and disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/313,111, filed May 17, 1999, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/665,354, filed Sep. 9, 2000, the disclosures of which are likewise incorporated herein by reference. Such heat treatment stations or furnaces further generally enable the reclamation of sand from the sand cores and/or sand molds of the castings, dislodged during heat treatment of the castings.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After heat treating, the castings generally are then removed from the heat treatment station and moved to a quenching station <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) for quenching the castings where they can be cleaned and further processed. The quenching station typically includes a quench tank having a cooling fluid such as water or other known coolant, or can comprise a chamber having a series of nozzles that apply cooling fluids such as air, water or similar cooling media as is known in the art. Thereafter, the castings will be removed from the quenching station for cleaning and further processing as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An additional embodiment of the integrated facility <b>5</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In this embodiment, the transfer mechanism <b>27</b>, here illustrated as a crane or robotic arm <b>28</b>, removes the castings from multiple pouring lines or stations <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>&#x2032;, here illustrated as a carousel type system in which the molds are rotated between pouring or casting positions <b>23</b> and a transfer point <b>24</b> at which the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> either engages and transports the sand molds with their castings therein or removes the castings from the molds and transfers the castings to one or more inlet conveyors <b>34</b> and <b>34</b>&#x2032; of the heat treatment unit <b>26</b>. The castings can be individually moved into and through the process temperature control station <b>36</b> for introduction into the heat treatment station <b>42</b>, or can be collected in baskets or conveying trays <b>79</b> for processing the castings in batches.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the process temperature control station <b>36</b> generally is formed as an elongated radiant tunnel <b>81</b> defining a chamber <b>82</b> through which the castings and/or sand molds with castings contained therein are moved or conveyed. The radiant tunnel <b>81</b> generally includes a series of heat sources <b>83</b> mounted therealong, such as the various different heating sources <b>45</b>, <b>45</b>&#x2032;, and <b>45</b>&#x2033; discussed above with respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> and <b>4</b>A-<b>6</b>B. Typically, the walls <b>84</b> and ceiling of the chamber <b>82</b> of the radiant tunnel <b>81</b> are formed from or are coated with a refractory material so that the heat generated within the radiant tunnel is reflected/radiated towards the castings as they are moved therealong. At the end of the radiant tunnel <b>81</b> is a collection station <b>86</b> where the castings can be collected and/or deposited into a basket <b>79</b> or similar conveying tray for batch processing of the castings, or sand molds with castings contained therein, through the heat treatment station <b>42</b>. The collection of the castings within the baskets for batch processing in the heat treatment station also can be done before the castings are passed through the radiant chamber or tunnel of the process temperature control station <b>36</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Still a further embodiment of the integrated facility <b>5</b> of the present invention is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In this embodiment, the process temperature control station <b>36</b>, here indicated as comprising an elongated radiant tunnel or chamber <b>81</b> (as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), connects or feeds into a chill removal station <b>87</b>, which is in communication with and feeds the castings into the heat treatment station <b>42</b>. Typically, in this embodiment the castings will be moved and heat-treated or processed while still contained within their semi-permanent or sand molds, which further include &#x201c;chills&#x201d; mounted therein. Chills generally are metal plates, typically formed from steel or similar material, having a design relief for forming desired design features of a casting surface and are placed within the molds at or prior to the pouring of the molten metal material therein. The chills consequently must be removed prior to heat treatment of the castings or reclamation of the chills and reuse. After passing through the chamber <b>82</b> of the radiant tunnel <b>81</b> during which the combustion of the sand molds generally will at least partially have begun, the chills can be easily removed therefrom without significantly delaying the movement of the molds and castings into the heat treatment station <b>42</b>. Following the removal of the chills in the chill removal station, the molds with their castings within are generally passed directly into the heat treatment station for heat treatment, sand core and sand mold breakdown, and sand reclamation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Still a further alternative embodiment of the integrated facility of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. In this embodiment, the castings generally can be removed from their molds and transported to an inlet conveyor <b>90</b> or <b>91</b> for being fed directly into one or more heat treatment furnaces or stations <b>92</b>. Alternatively, if the castings are being formed within sand molds, the entire mold will be transported from the transfer point <b>28</b> to one of the inlet conveyors <b>90</b> or <b>91</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the removal of the castings from their molds and subsequent transfer of the castings, or the removal of the molds with the castings remaining therein from the pouring station and transport to the heat treatment stations <b>92</b> generally can be done by the same transport mechanism or manipulator.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, a heat source <b>93</b> is shown mounted to the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> itself and applies heat directly to the castings and/or sand molds as the castings are moved from the transfer points of the pouring lines to one of the inlet conveyors <b>90</b> or <b>91</b> for a heat treatment furnace <b>92</b>. The heat source, as discussed above, can include a radiant energy source such as infrared or electromagnetic emitters, inductive, convective, and/or conductive heat sources, or other types of heat sources as will become apparent to those skilled in the art. The heat from the heat source <b>93</b> mounted to the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> is generally directed at one or more surfaces such as the top and/or sides of the castings or molds as the castings or molds are transferred to the inlet conveyor so as to arrest the cooling of the castings and/or molds and thus maintain the temperature of the casting metal substantially at or above the process control temperature of the metal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additional heat sources, such as indicated at <b>94</b>, can be mounted above or adjacent the inlet conveyors <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, or along the paths of travel of the transfer mechanism as indicated by arrows <b>96</b> and <b>96</b>&#x2032; and <b>97</b> and <b>97</b>&#x2032; to maintain the heating and arresting of the temperature of the castings. In addition, blowers, fans or other similar air movement devices (not shown) also can be positioned adjacent the transfer mechanism or along its path of movement, indicated by arrows <b>96</b> and <b>96</b>&#x2032; and <b>97</b> and <b>97</b>&#x2032;, for applying a heated media, such as air or other heated fluids for distributing the heat being applied to the casting and/or mold being transported substantially about the sides, top and bottom thereof, to try to reduce the incidence of cold spots and uneven heating or cooling of the castings during transfer from the pouring line to the heat treatment furnace(s) <b>92</b>. The use of such heat sources or elements mounted on the transfer mechanism and, in some arrangements, along the path of travel of the castings, thus perform the function of the process temperature control station to help arrest and maintain the castings at or above the process control temperature therefore.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in still a further embodiment of the integrated metal processing facility, the castings and/or sand molds can be placed directly within collection baskets or conveying tray <b>100</b> by the transfer mechanism <b>27</b> for feeding into the process temperature control station as part of an overall batch heating process for the castings, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In such an arrangement, the castings <b>12</b> generally will be loaded into a series of compartments or chambers <b>101</b> of the conveying tray <b>100</b>, with the castings located in known, indexed positions for directed application of heat for de-coring and other functions as the castings are moved into and through a process temperature control station <b>102</b> and heat treatment station <b>103</b>, as disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/665,354, filed Sep. 9, 2000, incorporated herein by reference. In this embodiment, the trays <b>100</b> typically will be indexed into and out of the chamber <b>104</b> of the process temperature control station as indicated by arrows <b>106</b> and <b>106</b>&#x2032; as the castings are loaded therein. As a result, the exposure of the castings to the ambient environment, which would allow them to cool down below their process control or critical temperature, is minimized while the various other compartments <b>101</b> of the tray are loaded with the remaining castings of the batch.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is further possible to provide directed heat sources <b>107</b> for each of the compartments <b>101</b> of the trays <b>100</b>. For example, as a first compartment <b>101</b>&#x2032; is loaded with a casting <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and indexed into the process temperature control station <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first heat source <b>107</b>&#x2032; will be engaged to apply heat directed specifically toward the casting and/or sand mold within that particular chamber. Thereafter, as successive castings or molds are loaded into the other chambers or compartments of the basket, additional heat sources <b>107</b> directed to those compartments are engaged. Thus, the heating of the chamber <b>104</b> of the process temperature control station can be limited or directed to specific regions or zones as needed for more efficient heating of the castings.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates, a series of blowers or other similar air movement devices <b>108</b> generally can be mounted to the roof of the process temperature control station for drawing off waste gases generated by the degradation of the sand core and/or sand mold binder materials, which gases and additional waste heat are then directed via conduits <b>109</b> into the heat treatment station <b>103</b> for heat reclamation and pollution reduction, as well as further helping to avoid the collection of combustible wastes on the sides and ceiling of the chamber of the process temperature control station <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that while the present invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiment as disclosed above, various additions, deletions, modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It will also be understood that the various embodiments and/or features thereof can be combined to form additional embodiments of the present invention.</p>
