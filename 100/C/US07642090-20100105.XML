<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to systems and methods for generating compost. More particularly, the invention relates to an aerated compost generation system that provides substantial reduction of compost odor emission and evaporative drying of compost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Composting is an effective waste management tool used to convert organic wastes into useful products. Various systems and methods for generating compost to improve the disposal and the beneficial re-use of organic wastes, such as garden waste, bio-solids, agricultural waste, municipal solid waste and the like, are known. Many of these systems and methods focus on the improvement of compost odor control, the rapid stabilization of compost, and the reduction of operating costs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of compost generating system known in the art involves aeration. Generally, there are two different types of aeration: forced aeration and passive aeration. Forced, or fan-induced, aeration is generally utilized to provide sufficient oxygen for maintaining aerobic conditions of the microbes needed for compost generation. Forced aeration is also employed to maintain optimal temperature levels in order to reduce the production of odorous emissions. There are two basic types of forced aeration: positive and negative aeration. Composting systems that use positive aeration introduce air to the bottom of the compost pile, and the air exits the compost pile at the top of the pile. Composting systems that use negative aeration draw air from the surface of the compost pile, and the air is distributed down through an aeration floor and into an aeration network, where the odiferous air is treated to reduce its odor. Composting systems that utilize positive aeration have the disadvantage that ammonia and other odorous and/or corrosive gases are released from the surface of the compost pile. Systems that employ negative aeration usually have operational problems associated with the collection, removal and disposal of particulate matter and moisture drawn into the aeration networks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Composting using passive aeration systems is generally carried out in large scale using turned windrow and passive heaps. However, these systems are commonly associated with significant compost odor emissions due to low oxygen levels, uncontrolled temperatures, and open compost piles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another type of compost generating system, the composting processes take place in enclosed structures. These enclosed systems are capable of capturing the odiferous air resulting from the composting process, which usually evolves at the surface of the compost pile. The captured odiferous air is then conveyed to a fan exhaust and treated for odor reduction before being released into the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are generally three different types of enclosed compost generating systems: in-vessel composting systems, in-building composting systems, and fabric-covered composting systems. In-vessel composting systems provide a sealed and insulated space for the biomass for each controlled volume of generated compost. In-building composting systems involve one or more open piles of compost stored in a single building, sharing a common headspace and sometimes intermingling biomass. Fabric-covered composting systems utilize a fabric, or film, to cover a discrete volume of compost, and can be used either in an enclosed structure or in an open area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Three kinds of fabric or film covers are generally used in connection with fabric-covered composting systems. Macro-porous covers, such as the Compostex&#xae; brand, are constructed of a macro-porous fabric that is akin to a blanket. Macro-porous covers allow easy passage of air and can be used with composting systems that involve positive and/or negative aeration. Such covers are relatively thick, and provide moderate thermal insulation and minimal reduction of surface evaporation rates. They have the disadvantage that they do not control compost odors and are water-absorbent, and can therefore become heavy and difficult to transport.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Micro-porous covers are generally constructed of micro-porous, gas permeable, fabric and provide low air-flow rates. They can only be used with composting systems that involve positive aeration and require weighted edges to hold the covers in place as the covers tend to &#x201c;balloon&#x201d;, due to gas flow constriction through the fabric. The low air flow rates result in low oxygen levels and very high temperatures of the biomass. These conditions reduce the efficiency of the aerobic bacteria that generate the compost. Micro-porous covers allow minimal passage of moisture, thereby preventing drying. In addition, most of the water soluble odiferous compounds are trapped in the water under the cover and are therefore not released into the atmosphere. Further, micro-porous covers provide little thermal insulation, are quite heavy and are very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third type of cover used with composting systems is impermeable plastic sleeves that are adapted from silage bags used to prepare and store feed for cattle. These sleeves are generally constructed of polyethylene, have a tube configuration up to about 200 feet in length, and are filled with compost by means of a special machine. The machine can also be employed to insert a perforated aeration tube into the center of the impermeable plastic sleeve. Air ports are located along the length of the aeration tube, allowing air to be drawn in and out of the impermeable plastic sleeve. However, the resulting aeration is very uneven radially about and along the axis of the sleeve. As a result, the generated compost is usually dry on top and saturated with moisture at the bottom. In order to access the compost after processing, the plastic sleeve, or tube, is slit and disposed of, and is thus not reusable. Further, foul leachate is often released onto the ground and surroundings when the plastic sleeve is removed. Compost generated using these plastic sleeves often requires significant additional processing to obtain stability.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There thus remains a need for compost generating systems and methods that overcome the aforementioned disadvantages and problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Systems and methods for generating compost utilizing aeration are provided. The systems disclosed herein are capable of controlling compost odors, maintaining the desired oxygen levels in the biomass, and minimizing evaporative drying of the biomass. The disclosed systems and methods for generating compost may utilize negative or positive aeration.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of a negative aeration composting system, the composting system comprises a reusable compost cover formed from substantially impermeable material, and an aeration floor through which gases can be suctioned. Biomass for use in generating compost is placed on the aeration floor, and the compost cover is placed over the biomass. The edges of the compost cover, which substantially covers the biomass, may be weighted and/or connected to the aeration floor by way of strapping means connected to fastening points in the aeration floor, in order to provide a loose seal to the aeration floor. During operation, the compost cover is further held in place by the negative aeration, or suction, generated by the aeration floor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The compost cover is formed of a material that is substantially gas and liquid impermeable, and is provided a plurality of aeration ports, or orifices, that permit the passage of gases through the cover. The size and number of aeration ports may be varied to meet the air-flow requirements for given biomass, or feed stocks, zone size and process goals. The compost cover is generally constructed of fabric that is durable, flexible, UV resistant, waterproof, and relatively light-weight.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aeration floor may be constructed of concrete or the like, and has a generally flat, planar working surface. The surface of the aeration floor is provided with a plurality of gas flow apertures, or orifices, that connect to at least one gas flow pipe, or channel, installed below grade. In certain embodiments, a network of gas flow pipes and/or channels is provided. An air suction manifold is sealably and removably connected to at least one outlet of the network of gas flow channels and/or pipes, providing air removal from the compost biomass. The air suction manifold draws air and/or other gases downwards from the bottom area of the biomass, through the plurality of gas flow apertures in the aeration floor, and into the network of gas flow channels and/or pipes. The air travels through the network of channels and/or pipes and is conveyed towards the outlet. The air then passes through the air suction manifold to an air distributor that is sealably and removably connected to the air suction manifold. Through the air distributor, the air from the compost biomass is distributed towards a discharge manifold that directs the air towards an odor control device, such as a biofilter, where the air is treated to substantially eliminate compost odors.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The composting system may be connected to a central aeration and control system which controls the air flow, temperature, pressure and other variables of the composting system via automatic or manual means. The aeration and control system serves to deliver and modulate the air flow to maintain the desired conditions in the compost biomass. In one embodiment, the aeration and control system is automated to modulate the flow of air based on the feedback of at least one process variable. The ranges of the variables may be preset by an operator. Process variables include, but are not limited to, temperature, oxygen level, pressure, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment of the negative aeration composting system, the composting system comprises a compost cover, an aeration floor through which gases can be removed, and at least one tubing system positioned on top of, or within, the compost pile, wherein the system is capable of providing recirculating aeration. The compost cover may be constructed of a substantially gas and liquid impermeable material, and provided with a plurality of aeration ports, or orifices, positioned on the surface of the compost cover. Alternatively, aeration ports may be omitted from the compost cover, whereby the compost cover is substantially gas and liquid impermeable. As described above, the surface of the aeration floor is provided with a plurality of gas flow apertures, or orifices that communicate with at least one, for example a network of, gas flow pipes and/or channels installed below grade. An air suction manifold that is sealably and removably connected to at least one outlet of the network of channels and/or pipes, provides suction of exhaust air from the bottom area of the compost biomass. The system additionally comprises an air distributor that is sealably and removably connected to the air suction manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An air inlet is connected to the air suction manifold by way of an air modulating device, such as a valve or fan, thereby providing fresh air to the system. The fresh air is mixed with the exhaust air having low levels of oxygen which exits from an outlet of the aeration floor. The resulting mixture of fresh air and exhaust air passes to the air distributor. A portion of the air mixture is then distributed towards a discharge manifold by way of an air modulating device, such as a valve or fan, which directs the air mixture towards an odor control device, such as a biofilter.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the remaining portion of the fresh and exhaust air mixture is recirculated and distributed to the compost pile by way of at least one tubing system. The tubing system, which comprises a plurality of aeration ports, is arranged generally on or below an upper surface of the compost biomass pile. The mixture of fresh and exhaust air is returned to the compost biomass pile through the aeration ports, providing recirculating aeration to the composting system. In another embodiment, the remaining portion of the air mixture is recirculated and distributed to the compost pile via the compost cover, which is provided with a network of perforated aeration channels on its surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other embodiments, positive aeration composting systems are provided. In one such embodiment, the composting system comprises a compost cover, a positively aerated floor, and a suction system positioned in proximity to, or associated with, the compost cover and located near a top of a biomass pile. Biomass for use in generating compost is placed on the positively aerated floor, and the compost cover is placed over the biomass. The edges of the compost cover, which substantially covers the biomass, may be weighted and/or connected to the positively aerated floor by way of strapping means connected to fastening points in the positively aerated floor, in order to provide a loose seal to the positively aerated floor. During operation, air flow drawn by the suction system at the top of the biomass pile maintains a negative pressure across the compost cover, thereby generating suction between the compost cover and the top of the compost biomass pile. The suction causes the compost cover to be substantially sealed onto the top of the compost biomass pile, preventing release of gasses from the biomass to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the compost cover is formed of a material that is substantially gas and liquid impermeable. In another embodiment, the compost cover is formed of a material that is semi-permeable. The compost cover is generally constructed of fabric that is flexible, durable, UV resistant, waterproof, and relatively light-weight.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The positively aerated floor may be constructed of concrete or the like, and has a generally flat, planar working surface. In one embodiment, the surface of the positively aerated floor is provided with a plurality of channels, such as trenches or pipes, that connect to at least one gas flow pipe, or channel, installed below or above grade. In another embodiment, the positively aerated floor is employed with an aeration vault forming system, described in detail below. The aeration vault forming system is placed on the upper surface of the working surface of the floor, and the compost biomass pile is placed over the top of the vault forming system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The suction system can be in the form of a longitudinal tube or pipe, having a plurality of apertures. In one embodiment, the suction system is integral to the compost cover and the compost cover is provided with no ports or orifices. In another embodiment, the suction system is positioned external to the compost cover and is connected to at least one port or orifice provided on the compost cover.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the positive aeration composting system comprises a forced air system sealably and removably connected to at least one outlet of a network of gas flow channels, pipes, trenches or an aeration vault forming system (described below), providing air to the compost biomass. In an alternative embodiment, the positive aeration composting system is not provided with a forced air system. In this embodiment, the suction through the compost cover at the top of the compost biomass pile draws atmospheric air into the network of gas flow channels, pipes, trenches, or aeration vault forming system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another embodiment of the disclosed composting system, the composting system, utilizing negative or positive aeration, comprises a generally planar working surface, an aeration vault forming system, and an optional compost cover. The aeration vault forming system is placed on the upper surface of the working surface, and a compost biomass pile is placed over the top of the aeration vault forming system. A compost cover may optionally be placed on top of the compost biomass pile. The aeration vault forming system is generally substantially hollow and may be either rigid or semi-rigid. In certain embodiments, the aeration vault forming system comprises an inflatable form. The aeration vault forming system may be left in place on the working surface, on which the compost pile is allowed to settle. Alternatively, after the compost pile settles on the aeration vault forming system, the vault forming system may be removed. When an aeration vault forming system comprising an inflatable form is employed, the inflatable form may be deflated prior to removal. Upon removal of the vault forming system, an aeration vault having substantially the same dimensions as the removed vault forming system is formed underneath, or within, the compost biomass pile.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The aeration vault may be left open at one or both ends whereby air can flow freely through the aeration vault via the open ends, allowing the compost biomass pile to be aerated. Alternatively, the one end of the aeration vault may be connected to a forced air aeration system, allowing induced aeration to take place within the negative or positive aeration composting system, wherein desirable oxygen and temperature levels of the compost biomass pile can be controlled and maintained, and the production of compost odors can be substantially eliminated.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Systems and methods for generating compost that employ aeration to aerobically degrade and stabilize organic wastes are provided. The composting systems disclosed herein are capable of effectively controlling compost odors, maintaining desired oxygen levels in the biomass, and minimizing evaporative drying of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, negative aeration composting system <b>100</b> comprises at least one aerated composting zone <b>5</b>. Composting system <b>100</b> is provided with a compost cover <b>10</b> and an aeration floor <b>50</b>. Compost biomass <b>30</b> for use in generating compost is placed on aeration floor <b>50</b>, and compost cover <b>10</b> is placed over and substantially covers biomass <b>30</b>. The edges of compost cover <b>10</b> may be weighted and/or may be provided with straps that connect to fastening points in aeration floor <b>50</b>. Compost cover <b>10</b> is further held in place by way of suction generated from aeration floor <b>50</b>. A central aeration and control system (not illustrated) controls the air flow, temperature, pressure, and the like, of disclosed composting system <b>100</b> via automatic or manual means. In embodiments where composting system <b>100</b> is provided with a plurality of aerated composting zones, each composting zone may be controlled either independently or collectively by the central aeration and control system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Compost cover <b>10</b> is constructed of a durable fabric that is substantially gas and liquid impermeable, and preferably reusable. Compost cover <b>10</b> is provided with a plurality of aeration ports, or orifices, <b>20</b> positioned on its surface. Aeration ports <b>20</b> are replaceable and may be constructed in any size and configuration to meet the air-flow requirements for various feedstock, zone size, and process goals. Aeration ports <b>20</b> may also be constructed to allow variable and manual sizing of their apertures, and each aeration port <b>20</b> may be provided with a one-way flow check valve. In certain embodiments, aeration ports <b>20</b> have generally circular configurations, with a diameter of from about 0.05 inches to about 1.5 inches. Aeration ports may thus measure, for example, about 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 inches in diameter. The ports <b>20</b> may be completely open, partially open, or completely closed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fabric of compost cover <b>10</b> prevents the passage of gas or liquid except through aeration ports <b>20</b>. Compost cover <b>10</b> is generally constructed of durable, UV resistant, waterproof, and relatively light-weight materials. As described above, compost cover <b>10</b> substantially covers compost pile <b>30</b> and is held in place to aeration floor <b>50</b>, providing a loose seal. Compost cover <b>10</b> may be held in place to aeration floor <b>50</b> by means of weights provided at its edges. Alternatively, the edges of the compost cover <b>10</b> may be provided with strapping means whereby compost cover <b>10</b> may be connected to fastening means positioned on aeration floor <b>50</b>. The weight means and/or strapping means act to secure cover <b>10</b> in windy conditions, as well as during recovery and deployment steps. During operation, the negative aeration of composting system <b>100</b> causes compost cover <b>10</b> to cling to the compost pile <b>30</b>, thereby loosely sealing compost cover <b>10</b> to the aeration floor <b>50</b>. Compost cover <b>10</b> may be placed over or removed from compost pile <b>30</b> using, for example, a commercial tarp-roller.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, compost cover <b>10</b> may be provided with an integrated compost pile irrigation system to maintain moisture during periods of high aeration. Compost cover <b>10</b> may also, or alternatively, be provided with an integrated air re-circulation network to introduce warm air to the upper area of the compost biomass <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Unlike various micro-porous compost covers known in the art, the permeability of compost cover <b>10</b> does not change over time due to soiling, and the aeration ports <b>20</b> of compost cover <b>10</b> may be constructed to permit any air flow rate. Also, unlike impermeable plastic compost sleeves, compost cover <b>10</b> is re-usable, may be readily removed from the compost pile <b>30</b> to allow turning and re-mixing of the compost, and may be integrated with an aeration floor <b>50</b> that can collect and manage condensate or leachate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aeration floor <b>50</b> may be constructed of concrete or the like. In one embodiment, the surface of aeration floor <b>50</b> is provided with a plurality of gas flow apertures, or orifices, that correspond to a network of gas flow channels <b>40</b> installed below grade of aeration floor <b>50</b>. Pipes, tubes, conduits, hoses, trenches, ditches, gutters, dugouts, vaults formed in the compost and the like, may be use in addition to, or in place of, channels <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the gas flow apertures are provided in generally rigid covers, or plates, that are positioned on top of, and cover, gas flow channels <b>40</b>. Such plates may be formed, for example, from stainless steel. An air suction manifold <b>60</b>, which is sealably and removably connected to at least one outlet <b>80</b> of the network of gas flow channels <b>40</b>, provides air suction from the bottom area of compost biomass <b>30</b>. Air suction manifold <b>60</b> draws and distributes odorous exhaust air from compost biomass <b>30</b> through the plurality of gas flow apertures of aeration floor <b>50</b>, to the network of gas flow channels <b>40</b>, and through outlet <b>80</b>. The air then passes through air suction manifold <b>60</b>, to air distributor <b>70</b> that is sealably and removably connected to air suction manifold <b>60</b> at its inlet. Air distributor <b>70</b> may be, for example, an air blower. From air distributor <b>70</b>, the exhaust air from compost biomass <b>30</b> is passed to a discharge manifold connected to the output of air distributor <b>70</b>. The discharge manifold directs the air towards an odor control device (not shown) such as a biofilter. The exhaust air is then treated by the odor control device to substantially eliminate the compost odor, and the treated air is distributed into its surroundings. Aeration floor <b>50</b> is compatible with front end-loaders and is resistant to plugging by compost biomass <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment, aeration floor <b>50</b> has a network of gas flow channels <b>40</b>, defined by a plurality of perforated pipes, installed on-grade that provide air suction at the bottom of compost biomass <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The aeration and control system of disclosed system <b>100</b> serves to secure compost cover <b>10</b>, and to deliver and modulate the air flow to maintain the desired conditions in the compost biomass <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the aeration and control system is automated to modulate the flow of air based on the feedback of at least one process variable. The ranges of the variables may be preset by an operator. Process variables include, but are not limited to, temperature, oxygen level and pressure. Alternatively, the aeration and control system may be controlled manually by an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The process variable settings may include a minimum suction setting sufficient to keep compost cover <b>10</b> held in place to aeration floor <b>50</b> and to prevent fugitive emissions, a minimum air-flow rate sufficient to maintain a minimum oxygen level to satisfy metabolic requirements of the aerobic bacteria within the biomass, and a maximum temperature setting to avoid overheating the biomass <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows another embodiment of a negative aeration composting system <b>200</b>. Composting system <b>200</b>, which is capable of providing recirculating aeration, comprises a compost cover <b>210</b>, an aeration floor <b>50</b>, and a tubing system <b>220</b>. In this embodiment, compost cover <b>210</b> is substantially gas and liquid impermeable. As for composting system <b>100</b> described above, the surface of aeration floor <b>50</b> is provided with a plurality of gas flow apertures that correspond to a network of gas flow pipes and/or channels <b>40</b> installed below grade. An air suction manifold <b>60</b> is sealably and removably connected to at least one outlet <b>80</b> of the network of channels and/or pipes, and provides removal of exhaust gases from the bottom area of the compost biomass <b>30</b>. An air distributor <b>70</b> is sealably and removably connected to the air suction manifold <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An air inlet <b>235</b> is connected to air suction manifold <b>60</b>, for example by way of an air valve <b>240</b>, and provides fresh air to the system. The fresh air is mixed with the hot exhaust air having low levels of oxygen, which exits from outlet <b>80</b> of the aeration floor <b>50</b>. The mixture of fresh air and exhaust air travels towards the air distributor <b>70</b>. A portion of the air mixture is distributed towards a discharge manifold, for example by way of a valve <b>245</b>, which directs the air mixture towards an odor control device, such as a biofilter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the remaining portion of the air mixture passes through an air flow control device, such as valve <b>250</b>, and is recirculated to the compost pile <b>30</b> via a network of perforated aeration channels (not shown) provided in compost cover <b>210</b>. In another embodiment, the remaining portion of the fresh and exhaust air mixture passes through valve <b>250</b>, and is recirculated to the compost pile <b>30</b> by way of at least one tubing system <b>220</b>. Tubing system <b>220</b> comprises a plurality of aeration ports, or orifices, <b>230</b>, and is arranged generally on or below an upper surface of the compost pile <b>30</b>, whereby the mixture of fresh and exhaust air is returned to compost pile <b>30</b>, providing recirculating aeration to the composting system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows an embodiment of a positive aeration composting system <b>500</b>. Composting system <b>500</b> comprises a compost cover <b>510</b>, a positively aerated floor <b>520</b>, and a suction system <b>530</b> positioned under or substantially close to compost cover <b>520</b> and generally near a top of a biomass pile <b>540</b>. Biomass for use in generating compost is placed on positively aerated floor <b>520</b>, and compost cover <b>510</b> is placed over biomass pile <b>540</b>. The edges <b>550</b> of compost cover <b>510</b>, which substantially covers the biomass pile <b>540</b>, may be weighted and/or connected to floor <b>520</b> by way of strapping means connected to fastening points in floor <b>520</b>, in order to provide a loose seal to the positively aerated floor <b>520</b>. During operation, air flow drawn by suction system <b>530</b> at the top of biomass pile <b>540</b> maintains a negative pressure across compost cover <b>510</b>, thereby generating suction between compost cover <b>510</b> and the top of compost biomass pile <b>540</b>. The suction causes compost cover <b>510</b> to be substantially sealed onto the top of compost biomass pile <b>540</b>, preventing release of gasses from the biomass pile <b>540</b> to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the compost cover <b>510</b> is formed of a material that is substantially gas and liquid impermeable. Alternatively, compost cover <b>520</b> may be formed of a material that is semi-permeable to gas flow and comprises a plurality of micro-pores. The semi-permeable compost cover allows a low air flow rate (for example less than 0.2 cfm/ft<sup>2 </sup>continuous) at the low differential low pressures (for example, less than 2 inches of static water column) inherent in the disclosed compost generating system <b>500</b>. The use of a semi-permeable compost cover allows substantially all of the air flow to be directed towards suction system <b>530</b>, and not through the micro-pores in the semi-permeable compost cover, thereby overcoming the low aeration rate limits of the semi-permeable cover.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The positively aerated floor <b>520</b> may be constructed of concrete or the like, and has a generally flat, planar working surface. The surface of floor <b>520</b> is provided with a plurality of channels, or pipes, <b>560</b> that connect to at least one gas flow pipe, or channel, installed below or above grade. The positively aerated floor <b>520</b> may be provided with an aeration vault forming systems as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the positive aeration composting system <b>500</b> comprises a forced air system (not shown) sealably and removably connected to channels <b>560</b>, that provides a flow of air into the compost biomass <b>540</b>. Alternatively, a forced air system is not employed and suction system <b>530</b> draws atmospheric air into channels <b>560</b> and through compost biomass <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Suction system <b>530</b> can be in the form of a longitudinal tube or pipe, having a plurality of apertures <b>570</b>. In one embodiment, suction system <b>530</b> is integral to the compost cover <b>510</b> and the compost cover <b>510</b> has no ports or orifices. In another embodiment (not illustrated), suction system <b>530</b> is positioned external to compost cover <b>510</b> and is connected to at least one port or orifice provided in the compost cover.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment of the positive aeration composting system (not illustrated), the system does not comprise a mechanically constructed aeration floor but comprises a working surface, a compost cover, and a suction system positioned under, or in proximity, to the compost cover and generally near a top of a biomass pile. The compost cover optionally comprises a plurality of aeration ports. In this embodiment, the air flows into the biomass pile by air leakage along the edge of the compost cover and the working surface and through the optional aeration ports. The uniformity of the air flow through the compost pile may be enhanced by building the biomass pile on a layer of material that is coarse and porous, relative to the biomass pile. Examples of appropriate material include, but are not limited to, ground wood and crushed rock.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another composting system <b>300</b>. Composting system <b>300</b> comprises a working surface <b>310</b>, and an aeration vault forming system <b>320</b>. Composting system <b>300</b> is capable of providing positive, negative, passive or forced convective aeration. The aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> is placed on the upper surface of the working surface <b>310</b>, and a compost pile <b>30</b> is placed over vault forming system <b>320</b> on working surface <b>310</b>. A compost cover (not shown) may optionally be placed on top of the compost pile <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The aeration vault forming system <b>320</b>, which has a generally elongated, tubular, configuration, is generally hollow, and may be rigid or semi-rigid. In one embodiment, aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> comprises two rigid or semi-rigid guide tubes <b>330</b> positioned at its front and rear ends, an inflatable form, such as a tube or pipe, <b>340</b> which passes through, and extends between, the guide tubes. Inflatable form <b>340</b> is provided with a fill valve <b>350</b>, a pressure relief valve (not shown) and a connectable removal means <b>370</b> in proximity to one of its ends. Inflatable form <b>340</b>, which may be constructed of any air resistant or microporous fabric known in the art including, but not limited to, rubberized materials, nylon or polyester fabric and other materials used in the construction of inflatable watercraft, can be inflated by means of an air supply system (not illustrated). Inflatable form <b>340</b> is generally sized such that, when deflated, its cross-section is smaller than the internal diameter of guide tubes <b>330</b>, allowing removal of inflatable form <b>340</b> by pulling through guide tubes <b>330</b>. When inflated, inflatable form <b>340</b> preferably has an external diameter that is the same as or greater than the internal diameter of guide tubes <b>330</b>, such that tubes <b>330</b> are substantially filled by inflatable form <b>340</b>. While the embodiment illustrated herein employs two guide tubes with one being positioned at each end of inflatable form <b>340</b>, the aeration vault forming system may alternatively employ a single guide tube positioned at one end of the inflatable form <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Removal means <b>370</b> allows for easy removal of inflatable form <b>340</b> from compost pile <b>30</b> and may be in the form of pull straps, chains, loops, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an alternative embodiment, a generally rigid form, such as a pipe, may be employed in place of inflatable form <b>340</b>. Such rigid forms preferably have an external diameter that is smaller than the internal diameter of guide tubes <b>330</b>. Alternatively, a generally rigid form may be employed without guide tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> may be left in place on working surface <b>310</b> of composting system <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, at least a portion of inflatable form <b>340</b> is preferably gas permeable or semi-permeable. Alternatively, after compost pile <b>30</b> settles on aeration vault forming system <b>320</b>, inflatable form <b>340</b> and guide tubes <b>330</b> may be removed from the composting system <b>300</b>. When an aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> including an inflatable form is employed, the form may be deflated prior to removal from composting system <b>300</b>. Typically, inflatable form <b>340</b> is inflated to a pressure of about 2.5 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, after aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> is removed, an aeration vault, or channel, <b>400</b> having a substantially arch-like, circular or oval configuration, is formed underneath the compost pile <b>30</b>. Aeration vault <b>400</b> has substantially the same dimensions as inflatable form <b>340</b>. Compost pile <b>30</b> is typically between about four and fourteen feet in height, and may be, for example, between about four and six feet high, between about seven and nine feet high, or between about twelve and fourteen feet high. The height of compost pile <b>30</b> is generally considerably higher than the height of aeration vault <b>400</b> in order to preserve the arch configuration of vault <b>400</b>. Aeration vault <b>400</b> is typically between about six and eighteen inches, for example about 6 inches, 12 inches, 15 inches or 18 inches, in height, about six and eighteen inches wide at its base, and between fifteen to seventy five feet long. Composting system <b>300</b> may be provided with multiple, for example, two to four, formed aeration vaults <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Aeration vault <b>400</b> may be left open, whereby air can flow freely through vault <b>400</b> via the open ends, allowing the compost pile <b>30</b> to be passively aerated by way of natural convective aeration. Alternatively, one end <b>360</b> of vault <b>400</b> may be connected to a forced air aeration system (not shown), allowing induced aeration to take place by either positive or negative circulation within composting system <b>300</b>, whereby desirable oxygen and temperature levels of the compost pile <b>30</b> can be controlled and maintained, and the production of compost odors can be substantially eliminated. In one embodiment, a generally vertical wall is provided at one end of the aeration vault forming system. This wall is provided with a passageway extending through the wall such that, when the aeration vault forming system is removed, air is able to enter the aeration vault through the passageway. The wall additionally aids in keeping compost pile <b>30</b> in place on working surface <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Vault forming system <b>320</b> may be connected to an air pump for inflating and deflating inflatable form <b>340</b>. A vault spool may be employed for rolling the deflated inflatable form <b>340</b> following removal of the form from composting system <b>300</b>. An aeration and control system, as described above, may be connected to composting system <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In operation, inflatable form <b>340</b> is first unrolled off its spool and extended along the length of working surface <b>310</b>. The inflatable form <b>340</b> is then connected to a first guide tube <b>330</b> at a first end of aeration vault forming system <b>320</b> and a second guide tube <b>330</b> at the second end of aeration vault forming system <b>320</b>. Inflatable form <b>340</b> is fully inflated and forms a plug in both guide tubes <b>330</b>. A compost pile <b>30</b> is built over inflatable form <b>340</b>, for example using a bucket-loader or conveyor. The compost pile <b>30</b> is typically shaped so that guide tubes <b>330</b> have a first end exposed and a second end arranged under the full depth of compost pile <b>30</b>. Compost pile <b>30</b> is then allowed to settle over approximately 2-24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once compost pile <b>30</b> has settled, the valve at the front of inflatable form <b>340</b> is opened and inflatable form <b>340</b> is deflated. Typically, some compost falls onto the form <b>340</b> and causes uniform deflating along the entire length of inflatable form <b>340</b>. If additional deflating of form <b>340</b> is required, a vacuum device can be used. After another optional brief settling time, inflatable form <b>340</b> is pulled out from compost pile <b>30</b> through guide tube <b>330</b>. Compost material that has fallen from the roof of the aeration vault <b>400</b> onto the inflatable form <b>340</b> is brought out on top of the deflated form. Inflatable form <b>340</b> can be spooled directly as it is removed through guide tube <b>330</b>. Guide tube <b>330</b> is then capped so that the air being pulled through the aeration vault <b>400</b> does not bypass the compost pile <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Composting system <b>300</b> has the advantage of low cost and is easy to use because inflatable form <b>340</b> is relatively lightweight and easy to handle. Also, since inflatable form <b>340</b> is removable, it is not in the way of the front-end loaders when the compost pile is broken down. In addition, inflatable form <b>340</b> is not susceptible to damage from the loader and is reusable. Fewer forms <b>340</b> are required because, once the aeration vault under the compost pile is formed, the form <b>340</b> can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an inflatable form <b>410</b> is provided in a channel or halfpipe-shaped void or trench <b>420</b> formed, or cut into, the working surface such that, when deflated, forming system <b>410</b> shrinks down into channel <b>420</b>. Inflatable form <b>410</b> may thus be left in the pile during composting with minimal risk of damage from equipment such as a material moving machine. In one embodiment, inflatable form <b>410</b> is provided with a plurality of aeration ports <b>440</b> arranged along its length. When form <b>410</b> is inflated, air can be distributed into the biomass pile via ports <b>440</b>, thereby providing positive aeration at a lower surface of the biomass pile. Each aeration port <b>440</b> may include a one-way check valve so that, when suction is applied to form <b>410</b>, the form will shrink down into channel <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the working surface beneath the vault forming system is a smooth and low friction working surface that facilitates removal of the vault forming system from underneath a compost pile. The low friction surface can be achieved by applying high build low friction coatings to the working surface, or by installing thin polymeric sheets in lines approximately the width of the vault forming system along on its entire length.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another embodiment of an aeration vault forming system <b>600</b>. System <b>600</b> comprises a sleeve of fabric material <b>602</b> and at least three generally cylindrical inflatable tubes <b>604</b> positioned inside, and extending between the ends of, sleeve <b>602</b>. Sleeve <b>602</b> and tubes <b>604</b> may be positioned inside an elongated guide tube at each end of sleeve <b>602</b> and tubes <b>604</b> to facilitate positioning and removal of the aeration vault forming system. Tubes <b>604</b> are arranged in parallel with two of the tubes arranged on a lower surface, and one of the tubes arranged on top of the two bottom tubes. Each tube <b>604</b> is provided with a fill valve, a pressure relief valve, and a connectable removal means. In an alternative embodiment, sleeve <b>602</b> is omitted and the three tubes <b>604</b> are held in position by means of straps (not shown). The aeration vault forming system <b>600</b> is constructed with a cross-section that optimizes the vault's shape and the forming system's stability during deployment. The relative diameters of the tubes <b>604</b> can be varied to optimize the cross-section of the aeration vault forming system <b>600</b>. In one embodiment, sleeve <b>602</b> is about 250 feet long.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, aeration vault forming system <b>600</b> comprises at least six rigid or semi-rigid, generally cylindrical, inflatable tubes <b>604</b> arranged in parallel with three tubes arranged on the bottom, two tubes arranged in the middle, and one tube arranged on top of the two middle tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When placed under a compost pile, the aeration vault forming system <b>600</b> forms a vaulted ceiling in the shape of a structural arch. The greater the integrity of the arched vault once forming system <b>600</b> is removed, the less biomass material falls onto forming system <b>600</b> as it is deflated, and the longer the formed vault will stay intact. In another embodiment, the lower surface of the forming system <b>600</b> that contacts the working surface is widened to enhance stability during deployment. By constructing the bottom of the forming system <b>600</b> in a square-like configuration, for example, the forming system <b>600</b> can be placed without the system rolling or moving due to either biomass being dropped on to forming system <b>600</b> or windy weather conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, forming system <b>600</b> is left under the biomass pile during the composting period. To reduce the risk of damaging the forming system <b>600</b> by material handling equipment, such as a wheel loader, the forming system <b>600</b> may be installed in a channel or half pipe-shaped voided space cut into the working surface on which forming system <b>600</b> is placed. When forming system <b>600</b> is deflated, it shrinks down into the cut voided space and is positioned below the working floor, out of the reach of material handling equipment. The void space only needs to be large enough to accommodate the deflated forming system <b>600</b>, and thus the voided space can be relatively small in cross-section compared with a standard aeration channel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The fluid pressure in forming system <b>600</b> must be high enough to support the static weight of the biomass pile being built over the top of forming system <b>600</b>. In one embodiment, the fluid pressure in forming system <b>600</b> is between 0.5 and 5.0 psi. Since the forming system <b>600</b> needs to be left in place for a period of time sufficient to allow the biomass pile to settle prior to removal (1-24 hours), the fluid pressure must be maintained in the proper range during this period. The fluid pressure can increase due to biologically driven temperature increases within the biomass media, which causes air to expand. Conversely, the fluid pressure can decrease due to small perforations in the forming system <b>600</b> occurring in the course of use. In order to maintain the proper pressure, system <b>600</b> may additionally comprise a pressure maintenance device connected to the inflation/deflation port(s), and comprising a pressure regulator and a higher pressure air source.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Several of the composting systems disclosed herein employ a compost cover that is provided with aeration holes or ports that permit the flow of air through the cover. In one embodiment (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), compost cover <b>800</b> is provided with a plurality of aeration holes <b>802</b> that are clustered together in a tight pattern, leaving large areas of cover <b>800</b> intact. This clustering of holes <b>802</b> maintains the strength of cover <b>800</b> while allowing gas, such as air to pass through the cover. Holes <b>802</b> may have a diameter of about 1/16-&#xbc; inch. In one embodiment, holes <b>802</b> are provided in a cluster consisting of 36 holes, each with a diameter of &#x215b; inch and with a distance of about &#xbc; inch between each hole. Several such clusters of holes may be provided in a single cover, depending on the size of the cover, with the distance between each cluster being in the range of about 3 to 5 feet.</p>

It is thus intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as being illustrative and not limiting.</p>
