<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus for improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated materials. After the materials to be chrome plated are mechanically abrasively polished, but before they are reverse etched, they are power washed with a high-pressure liquid. A sprayer with nozzles directed inwardly towards the materials directs water onto the material at pressures in the range of 1000 or 2500 to 3000 psi. After the materials are chrome plated, they are heated above the melting point of a buffing compound, and then the heated materials with the buffing compound applied are buffed. An induction heater is used, before or after the buffing compound is applied. Computer controls, responsive to operator input of the cross-sectional size, composition and/or speed of movement of the chrome plated materials, to in turn regulate the power to an induction coil heater.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to preparing materials for chrome plating and to finishing chrome plated materials, and in particular, to methods and apparatus for improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Materials are chrome plated to reduce surface corrosion of the materials. Nevertheless, despite the chrome plating, surface corrosion still occurs and presents problems. This is particularly true in applications where there is intimate contact between the surface of the chrome plated materials and another material. Thus, for example, chrome plated rods used in hydraulic applications come into contact with seals made of rubber and similar materials. Surface corrosion of such rods has the additional disadvantage of causing accelerated wear of the seals. In use, such rods are subjected to high temperatures during operation of the equipment in which they are used, which increases the occurrence of corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to improve the corrosion resistance of chrome plated rods and the like, they are subjected in the prior art to a polishing process. A chrome plated rod is advanced along a line from an entrance end upon a series of pairs of offset rollers that both rotate and advance the rod from the entrance end to the exit end of the line. Generally, after the rod is placed on the offset conveying rollers, the periphery of the chrome plated rod is initially subjected to wet abrasive polishing at one or more polishing stations. After such wet abrasive polishing, a buffing compound, of any of a selected one of a number of commercially available mixtures, is applied to the rotating chrome plated rod. Usually such buffing compounds are applied in a multi-phase mixture by spraying them onto the rotating and advancing rod.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art process then subjects the rod, with the buffing compound applied, to a series of buffing steps at a number of buffing stations. Generally, three buffing stations are used in the prior art to provide the required amount of polishing or buffing to sufficiently drive the buffing compound into the micro cracks in the chrome plated surface. Thus, open micro cracks in the chrome plated surface are sealed against corrosion by the impregnated buffing compound.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such prior art processes, as the compound treated chrome plated surface is subjected to more polishing or buffing, it results in a higher surface finish. Thus, in the prior art process of improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated materials, there is a corollary between the degree of surface finish and the expected resultant corrosion resistance. However, particularly in hydraulic applications, there is a disadvantage to having too high of a surface finish as it impedes the effectiveness of the cooperating seals. Nevertheless, if the corrosion resistance of the chrome plated rods is not significantly improved by an application of a buffing compound, there will be a resulting increase in downtime of production of the hydraulic equipment while the corroded rods and/or the ruined seals need to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The effective corrosion resistance provided by the chrome plating of materials is also effected by the preparation of the materials to be chrome plated. Thus, as the chrome plated materials, such as rods, are subjected in the prior art to a polishing process after they are chrome plated, the rods are also subjected to a polishing process prior to chrome plating. A line like that used for advancing the chrome plated rod is also used for advancing the rods to be chrome plated. Accordingly, a rod to be chrome plated is advanced along a line from and entrance end upon a series of pairs of offset rollers that both rotate and advance the rod from the entrance end to the exit end of the line. Generally, after the rod is placed on the offset conveying rollers, the periphery of the rod to be chrome plated is subjected to abrasive polishing at one or more polishing stations. Usually, the material to be chrome plated is subjected to a series of abrasive polishing steps in which the abrasive or grit used to polish will vary to produce a smoother finish as the material to be chrome plated advances from the entrance end toward the chrome plating.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">After the rod is abrasively polished in the prior art process, it is immersed in a caustic solution cleaning tank and generally then subsequently immersed in one or more rinse tanks before being subjected to plating. In the prior art, normally the first plating step after the rod is abrasively polished and cleaned is reverse etching, prior to the actual chrome plating of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Generally, all other things being equal, the smoother the finish of the material to be chrome plated, the better will be the corrosion resistance provided by the chrome plating. Unfortunately, the abrasive polishing of the material to be chrome plated generally leaves strands, filaments or &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; of microscopic size. Such &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; are measured in microns, and their size varies as a result of the particular belt or wheel used to abrasively polish the material to be chrome plated. The presence of such &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; when the material to be chrome plated is reverse etched results in micro cavities wherever the &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; are present, which detrimentally affects the resulting corrosion resistance provided by the chrome plating. To the extent that such micro cavities or pockets can be eliminated prior to chrome plating, the effective corrosion resistance will be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated materials, in order to increase the life of such materials and to decrease the downtime of machines in which they are used.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other desirable characteristics of the present invention will become apparent in light of the present specification, including claims, and drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will be discussed herein in detail, a particular embodiment of the invention, with the understanding that the present disclosure is intended to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective, schematic illustration of part of an apparatus <b>10</b> for improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated rods. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that portion of a line <b>14</b> in which a chrome plated rod <b>12</b> has a buffing compound <b>32</b> applied by spraying onto the rod <b>12</b>, which is being both advanced and rotated. For ease of illustration, portions of line <b>14</b>, as they would generally exist in a commercial environment, have been omitted. Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, prior to what has been designated as the one entrance end <b>16</b>, there will be another portion of the line which initially receives chrome plated rod <b>12</b> and advances it through a series of wet abrasive polishing stations. Such wet abrasive polishing stations are conventional in the prior art processes and accordingly are omitted from this illustration. Similarly, it will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, beyond what has been designated as the other exit end <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is another portion of the line upon which the chrome plated rod is received for cooling and inspection after being advanced through the portion of the line illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">Chrome plated rod <b>12</b> is placed upon a series of pairs of offset driven rollers <b>28</b>, which both rotate rod <b>12</b> and advance it through line <b>14</b> from the one entrance end <b>16</b> through to the other exit end <b>18</b>. Again, for ease of illustration, most of such rollers <b>28</b> have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The number of rollers required, their structure, arrangement and driving mechanisms are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">The embodiment of the apparatus, and the method practiced using the apparatus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes three stations, which are defined along line <b>14</b> by the four housing sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. These housing sections conveniently enclose portions of the conventional drive mechanisms (not shown) that are used in the prior art for the rotating, advancing and polishing of chrome plated rod <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">After rod <b>12</b> is advanced through the wet polishing stations (not shown), it passes through housing section <b>20</b>. Either within housing section <b>20</b>, or as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, upon exit from housing station <b>20</b>, an applicator <b>30</b> applies a buffing compound <b>32</b>. The buffing compound may be selected from any of a number of commercially available buffing compounds, which have been used in the prior art processes. The buffing compound may be applied as a solid, or as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as a liquid by a spray applicator. Although the buffing compound may be referred to as a liquid, it is more correctly a multi-phase mixture that includes solids in liquid media, if it is not a solid at time of application. Each of the buffing compounds, more specifically the solids of the buffing compounds, has a melting point. Mostly, such melting points are below 160&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">In the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the buffing compound is applied to the rod, both the rod and the buffing compound pass through an induction heating coil. As an alternative embodiment, the rod could pass through the induction heating coil <b>40</b>, and the buffing compound <b>32</b> could then be applied. As a further embodiment, the heater need not be a coil, nor even be an induction heater. Conduction and/or convection heaters may be used to achieve a 160&#xb0; F. temperature of the chrome plated material, although they may require a greater time and/or distance to properly heat the chrome plated material.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">Induction coil <b>40</b> is connected through suitable conductors <b>42</b> to a power source (not shown). In addition, induction coil <b>40</b> is connected to a computer controller <b>44</b> which regulates the power to induction coil <b>40</b> for heating rod <b>12</b> to a temperature above the melting point of the buffing compound used. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, a temperature of 160&#xb0; F. has been used to melt buffing compound <b>32</b>. In addition, it is believed that heating rod <b>12</b> to the 160&#xb0; F. temperature causes any microcracks in the periphery of rod <b>12</b> to open up, facilitating impregnating them with buffing compound <b>32</b>. Of course, as rod <b>12</b> cools, such microcracks then tend to close up, capturing the impregnating compound.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">In order to facilitate operation in a commercial environment, computer controller <b>44</b> may be programmed by conventional programming methods to regulate the amount of power to induction coil <b>40</b> for achieving the desired temperature of rod <b>12</b>, in response to operator input of one or more factors, such as the speed of movement, composition of the chrome plated materials and size of the chrome plated material being processed, such as the diameter of a rod.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">After rod <b>12</b> has had buffing compound <b>32</b> applied, and after rod <b>12</b> is heated to a temperature above the melting point of buffing compound <b>32</b>, which may occur in the sequence illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or in the reverse sequence (not shown), the heated rod and buffing compound are subjected to buffing. Thus, within the station of line <b>14</b>, between housing sections <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, a rotating buffing wheel <b>34</b> engages rod <b>12</b> in a conventional manner. One or more additional subsequent buffing steps may also be used, such as at the station between housing sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> where rotating buffing wheel <b>36</b> buffs the heated rod and buffing compound, as well as possibly at the station illustrated between housing sections <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, where rotating buffing wheel <b>38</b> buffs rod <b>12</b> and buffing compound <b>32</b> may be employed. The present invention does, however, allow for reducing the degree of surface finish, if desired, while still obtaining a significant improvement in the corrosion resistance of the chrome plated material. In addition, buffing compounds having a wider range of melting points, which may be desirable in particular hydraulic applications, may be readily accommodated by varying the computer controlled heater input.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">As will be apparent from the foregoing description, and the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention provides an apparatus for practicing a method for improving corrosion resistance of chrome plated material. Thus, chrome plated material, such as rod <b>12</b>, is subjected to the steps of applying a buffing compound <b>32</b>, either as a solid, or a liquid using sprayer <b>30</b>, heating rod <b>12</b> to a temperature of approximately 160&#xb0; F., a temperature above the melting point of buffing compound <b>32</b>, and then subjecting the heated rod and applied buffing compound to at least one buffing wheel, before the rod cools down significantly. Thus, if rod <b>12</b> is heated to 160&#xb0; F., the buffing is accomplished while the rod is at approximately 140&#xb0; F. Generally, an acceptable standard of corrosion resistance using the prior art process was forty-eight hours in an ASTM B117 salt spray test. With the apparatus and method described above, ASTM B117 salt spray test results of seventy-two hours, and longer, have been routinely obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration of another part of apparatus <b>10</b> for further improving the corrosion resistance of chrome plated rods. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a portion <b>50</b> of line <b>14</b> in which the material, in the form of a rod <b>52</b>, that is to become chrome plated rod <b>12</b>, is prepared for chrome plating. Prior to the portion of a line <b>14</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the material <b>52</b> to be chrome plated enters the earlier portion <b>50</b> of the line at an earlier entrance end <b>54</b>. A series of pairs of offset driven rollers <b>28</b>, like those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, both rotate the rod <b>52</b> and advance it through the portion <b>50</b> of the line from the earlier entrance end <b>54</b> through to a chrome plating station <b>58</b> and then through the previously described series of wet abrasive stations and then through the portion <b>14</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through to the other exit end <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">The embodiment of the apparatus, and the method practiced using the apparatus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a number of polishing stations, which are for convenience of illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the single, last polishing station <b>62</b>. Such polishing stations are conventional in the art and generally include a series of abrasive polishing belts or wheels of decreasing grit size in order to produce an ever increasingly smoother finish of the material to be plated. As in the prior art, after the rod <b>52</b> that is to be chrome plated is subjected to the abrasive polishing, it may be immersed in a caustic solution cleaning tank <b>64</b>. After that, it may be immersed in one or more rinse tanks, which for convenience of illustration are indicated by the single rinse tank <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, in the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after the abrasive polishing <b>62</b>, rod <b>52</b>, preferably prior to being immersed in the caustic solution cleaning tank <b>64</b> and the rinse tank(s) <b>66</b>, is subjected to a power washer or power sprayer <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">Cleaning of the abrasively polished rod <b>52</b>, whether by immersion or spraying at standard pressure, does not remove the &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d;. Water is generally received from a municipality, or other such source, at a standard pressure of approximately 40 psi. In order to accomplish the desired effect of removing the microscopic sized &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; of the material, it is necessary to subject it to a high-pressure power wash of at least 100 psi. Indeed, it has been found preferable to subject the material to be chrome plated to a power wash in the range of 1000 to 3000 psi, and even to a higher pressure range of 2500 to 3000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">Water has been found to be an effective medium for the power washing step, although other liquids may also be usable. Thus, it is possible that a liquid including a caustic solution might obviate the need for immersion in a caustic solution cleaning tank, such as <b>64</b>. In any event, it is desirable to recirculate the power washing liquid. Such recirculation is accomplished by conventional techniques for the recirculation of water and other liquids used in other plating plant processing steps, and is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as the recirculation system <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">After the rod <b>52</b> is abrasively polished and power washed, and possibly immersed in a caustic solution cleaning tank <b>64</b> and rinse tanks <b>66</b>, it is subjected to a first plating step, more particularly, it is reverse etched at station <b>74</b>. Then rod <b>52</b> is chrome plated at station <b>58</b>. Reverse etching <b>74</b> is accomplished using apparatus and methods well known in the chrome plating art, as is the chrome plating <b>58</b> itself. Once chrome plated, rod <b>52</b> becomes the chrome plated rod <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is then processed as illustrated and previously described to further enhance its corrosion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">Power washer or sprayer <b>70</b> includes a plurality of nozzles. Thus, a pair of substantially diametrically opposed nozzles <b>76</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be used. Alternatively, a plurality of nozzles <b>78</b> may be inwardly directed towards rod <b>52</b> at substantially evenly spaced 120 degree intervals around rod <b>52</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, as rod <b>52</b> is being rotated and translated longitudinally by the series of pairs of offset rollers <b>28</b> through portion <b>50</b> of line <b>14</b> it is subjected to the high pressure water directed by nozzles <b>76</b> or <b>78</b> to power wash off the &#x201c;line hairs&#x201d;, as well as to clean the foreign residue.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">As will be apparent from the foregoing description, and the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present invention also provides an apparatus for practicing a method for further improving corrosion resistance of chrome plated material. Thus, rod <b>52</b> to be chrome plated, is subjected to a step of power washing with a high-pressure liquid, using sprayer nozzles, such as <b>76</b> or <b>78</b>, intermediate the last abrasive polishing station <b>62</b> of rod <b>52</b> and reverse etching station <b>74</b>. The high-pressure power wash not only facilitates the removal of foreign residue from the abrasive polishing step, but also blows or blasts off filaments or &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; of the material itself. Thus, the microcavities or pockets which would be created during reverse etching at sites of the &#x201c;fine hairs&#x201d; are substantially decreased resulting in a better, more corrosion resistant chrome plated material. After power washing, rod <b>52</b> may also be immersed in a caustic solution for cleaning and subsequent immersion rinses before the reverse etching step.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">The foregoing description and drawings merely explain and illustrate the invention and the invention is not limited thereto except insofar as the appended claims are so limited, as those skilled in the art who have the disclosure before them will be able to make modifications or variations therein without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
