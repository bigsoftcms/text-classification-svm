<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a new nucleic acid molecule that is codon-optimized to express beta interferon in <i>Escherichia coli </i>with greater efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many proteins or polypeptides are known that hold great promise for use in treating a wide variety of diseases or disorders. Interferons are relatively small polypeptide proteins which are secreted by most animal cells in response to exposure to a variety of inducers. Because of their antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties, interferons are of great interest as therapeutic agents. They exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events. In vitro studies demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulating activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells, and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells. Thus, interferon proteins are functionally defined, and a wide variety of natural and synthetic or recombinant interferons are known. There are three major types of human interferons (&#x201c;IFNs&#x201d;). These are: Leukocyte IFN or IFN-alpha, a Type 1 IFN produced in vivo by leukocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fibroblast IFN or IFN-beta, a Type 1 IFN produced in vivo by fibroblasts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Immune IFN or IFN-gamma, a Type 2 IFN produced in vivo by the immune system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">IFN-beta is of particular interest for the treatment of a number of diseases or disorders, and especially in the treatment of multiple sclerosis or MS. Natural human IFN-beta is a 166 amino acid glycoprotein, and the encoding gene has been sequenced by Taniguchi, et al. al., 1980, <i>Gene </i>10: 11-15, and R. Derynck, et al., supra. Natural IFN-beta has three cysteine (cys) residues, located at amino acid positions 17, 31 and 141, respectively. In addition, numerous recombinant variants of IFN-beta are known.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Three recombinant IFN-beta products are licensed in Europe and the U.S. for treatment of MS. These are interferon beta-1a (&#x201c;IFN-beta-1a &#x201d;) or Avonex&#xae; (Biogen, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.), another IFN-beta-1a product marketed as Rebif&#xae; (Ares-Serono, Norwood, Mass.) and Ser<sub>17 </sub>interferon-beta-1b (&#x201c;IFN-beta-1b <sub>Ser17</sub>&#x201d;) or Betaseron&#xae; (Berlex, Richmond, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">IFN beta-1a is produced in mammalian cells, e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary (&#x201c;CHO&#x201d;) cells using the natural human gene sequence, and the produced protein is glycosylated. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,795,779, 5,376,567 and 4,966,843, incorporated by reference herein. IFN beta-1b Ser<sub>17 </sub>differs structurally from IFN-beta1a (Avonex&#xae; and Rebif&#xae;) because it is produced in <i>Escherichia coli </i>(&#x201c;<i>E. coli</i>&#x201d;) using a modified human gene sequence having an engineered cysteine-to-serine substitution at amino acid position 17, so that the protein is non-glycosylated. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,588,585 and 4,737,462, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Both Rebif&#xae; and Avonex&#xae; are stated by their package inserts to have specific activities, by differing methods, of at least 2-3&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>international units (IU)/mg. The Betaseron&#xae; package insert reports a specific activity of approximately 3&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>IU/mg, indicating a ten-fold difference in potency. While these activities are determined by somewhat different methods, the order of magnitude differences in antiviral and antitumor activities are also reflected in the recommended doses, which are measured in micrograms (60-130 mcg/week) for the Rebif&#xae; and Avonex&#xae; glycosylated IFN-beta 1a products, and from 0.25 milligrams and up for the non-glycosylated Betaseron&#xae; IFN-beta 1b.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">IFN-beta, in each of its recombinant formulations, has multiple effects on the immune system, including the ability to inhibit viral replication. IFN-beta-1b is described by the manufacturer (Berlex, Richmond, Calif.) as enhancing suppressor T cell activity, reducing proinflamatory cytokine production, down-regulation of antigen presentation, and inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking into the central nervous system. Other sources have reported that IFN-beta reduces the production of IFN-gamma by T-lymphocytes. Other beneficial therapeutic effects are also suspected.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, production of recombinant proteins in cell culture remains an expensive process. For this reason, there remains a longstanding and heretofore unsolved need in the art for significantly improved vectors and methods of producing IFN-beta compositions, particularly those containing IFN-beta 1b, particularly in non-mammalian cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above-described needs are addressed, and other advantages are provided, by the nucleic acid molecule encoding IFN-beta-1b, that is described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of the present invention a vector and <i>E. coli </i>cell culture system is provided for economically producing IFN-beta-1b. The invention provides a nucleic acid molecule comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or its complement. The invention also provides an expression vector comprising the nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO: 1, or its complement. The expression is optionally a plasmid or a bacterial phage, e.g., suitable for expressing the inventive nucleic acid molecule in <i>E. coli. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention further provides a method of producing interferon beta 1b comprising culturing the above mentioned <i>Escherichia coli </i>host cell, and isolating interferon beta 1b produced by the host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the invention provides an interferon beta protein produced by above mentioned method.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;interferon-beta&#x201d; or &#x201c;IFN-beta&#x201d; as used herein refers to IFN-beta isolated from natural sources and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology as described in the art, having sequence homology with, and the functionality, including bioactivity, of native IFN-beta. The term &#x201c;interferon-beta 1b &#x201d; or &#x201c;IFN-beta 1b&#x201d; as used herein refers to a mutein of IFN-beta having residue Cys<sub>17 </sub>replaced by residue Ser<sub>17</sub>, and expressed in a nonglycosylated form, with the N-terminal amino acid, Methionine, post-translationally removed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Many muteins of the native human or animal IFN-beta are known and contemplated to be employed in the practice of the invention. Preferred muteins are described in greater detail by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,588,585, 4,959,314; 4,737,462 and 4,450,103, incorporated by reference herein. In brief, as noted above, a preferred mutein is one wherein the Cys<sub>17 </sub>residue of native human IFN-beta is replaced by serine, theonine, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan or methionine. Most preferred is the non-glycosylated Ser<sub>17 </sub>mutein of IFN-beta, also referred to herein as IFN-beta 1b.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Numerous methods of expressing and isolating IFN-beta proteins from host systems, and vectors suitable for expression by prokaryotic host cells, are known. For example, host systems include host cells selected from prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells. Prokaryotic host cells include bacteria, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Eukaryotic host cells include yeast cells, animal cells, e.g., in culture. The animal cells can include mammalian cells, such as primate or human cells, e.g., in culture, and optionally, human tissue cells, in vivo. Preferably, a mammalian host cell is a well characterized cell line adapted for continuous culture, such as a Chinese hamster ovary cell. Expression vectors suitable for expression in the selected host system are employed. Expression vectors include, for example, plasmid, bacterial phage, animal or plant virus, and/or other nucleic acid molecules suitable for replication in the selected host system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, much of the IFN-beta employed in the examples provided hereinbelow was produced by the following method. A synthetic gene encoding an IFN-beta, e.g., IFN-beta 1b, was synthesized, following codon optimization for bacterial expression.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other methods and reagents for IFN-beta production and purification are described, for example, by U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,107,057, 5,866,362, 5,814,485, 5,523,215, 5,248,769, 4,961,969, 4,894,334, 4,894,330, 4,748,234, 4,656,132, all incorporated by reference herein, as well as by other references too numerous to mention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Methods of expressing and isolating IFN-beta proteins, and vectors suitable for expression by eukaryotic host cells, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (&#x201c;CHO&#x201d;) cells, are described in detail, e.g., by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,966,843, 5,376,567, and 5,795,779, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">B. Codon-Optimized Nucleic Acids</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The use of the term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; herein encompasses both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) unless otherwise specified. It is art-known to optimize codons for expression and protein production in differing host organisms. It has been thought that the differences in the efficacy of expression in different host systems, by the same vector depends, among other factors, in the species of transfer RNA (&#x201c;t-RNA&#x201d;) that might be present in the cytoplasm of different host cell types. For example, mammalian DNA generally encodes for the amino acid arginine with the codons AGA or AGG, but <i>E. coli </i>more reliably responds to codon triplets of CGX for encoding arginine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Expression of eukaryotic gene products in prokaryotes is sometimes limited by the presence of codons that are infrequently used in <i>E. coli</i>. Expression of such genes can be enhanced by systematic substitution of the endogenous codons with codons over represented in highly expressed prokaryotic genes (Robinson et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>12:6663, 1984). Without being bound by any theology or hypothesis, it is commonly supposed that rare codons cause pausing of the ribosome, which leads to a failure to complete the nascent polypeptide chain and a uncoupling of transcription and translation. Pausing of the libosome is thought to lead to exposure of the 3&#x2032; end of the mRNA to cellular ribonucleases. Optimizing a gene to more efficiently express in a different host organism is known, although it cannot be predicted in advance whether the changes so produced will have the desired positive improvement in expression and production of the targeted protein. These changes can be implemented using any art-known synthetic or biological procedure, such as by preparing synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to IFN-beta 1b cDNA domains, with selected codons substituted therein, and then employing amplification methods, such as PCR, to insert the modified oligonucleotide into a target cDNA molecule. Preferably, the gene is synthesized de novo, by any art-standard method, to encode IFN-beta and/or IFN-beta 1b, using codons known to be optimally expressed by <i>E. coli</i>. More preferably, the gene is synthesized as a set of overlapping oligonucleotide segments, that are then assembled by standard methods into the completed optimized DNA molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The modified gene of the present invention can be designed to encode IFN-beta, and particularly human IFN-beta, and most particularly, IFN-beta 1b, as described supra.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The following example serves to provide further appreciation of the invention but is not meant in any way to restrict the effective scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Optimized DNA and Vector</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The human interferon beta-1b sequence was optimized for bacterial expression by following the standard bacterial codon usage for <i>Escherichia coli </i>K12, using the codon data described by Grantham R. et al.; 1981; &#x201c;Codon catalogue usage in genome strategy modulated for gene expressivity,&#x201d; <i>Nucleic Acid Res.</i>9:r43-r47, and Lathe, R. 1985; &#x201c;Synthetic oligonucleotide probes deduced from amino acid sequence data, Theoretical and Practical considerations.&#x201d; <i>J. Mol Biol;</i>183:1-12.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The corresponding RNA sequence was then analyzed for the formation of hairpin structure or loop formation and was subjected to minimum free energy calculations. The optimized cDNA sequence was further modified for four leucine residues, replacing TTA with CTG, at nucleotide positions 57, 81, 261, and 315, respectively. The leucine codon-modified sequence of interferon beta-1b was again subjected to minimum fee energy calculation and appeared to have very little free energy change compared to the initial optimization (&#x2212;117.8 k Cal as opposed to &#x2212;110.05 k Cal). The cDNA of interferon beta-1b encoding the reported 165 amino acid sequence of human IFN-beta 1b was then synthesized using standard chemical synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotide segments. The inventive DNA molecule can also be readily prepared by any other art-known methods, e.g., by employing PCR to insert segments with modified codons into the original reported cDNA encoding human IFN-beta 1b. The flanking restriction sites, NdeI and BamHI were included at the termini of the gene. Following digestion of the synthetic DNA with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI, the 0.5 Kb gene was then ligated via T4 DNA ligase into the plasmid vector pET-27<i>b </i>(+) (from Novagen Corporation), which was also digested with these two enzymes. The recombinant plasmid was then introduced into <i>E. Coli </i>strain BLR (DE3) by electroporation using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated on LB agar plates containing kanamycin (15 micrograms per ml) to allow for selection of colonies containing the plasmid pET-27<i>b </i>(+)/IF-beta-1b (designated plasmid No. 1). Isolated colonies were further purified by plating and analyzed for IPTG inducible gene expression by standard methods, such as those described in Novagen pET System Manual, Ninth Edition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transformed host cells produced about 10 fold more IFN beta protein per batch than did the same type of host cells employing the previously available, non-optimized cDNA coding for IFN-beta.</p>
