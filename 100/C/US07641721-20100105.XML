<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an aqueous solution of a chromium salt and a method for producing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Among various aqueous solutions of chromium salts, aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate are known to be used as surface treatment agents for metals. Aqueous solutions of chromium phosphate are used as treatment solutions for forming chemical conversion coatings on zinc-plated surfaces of various metals, such as iron, nickel, and copper (refer to Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a known method for producing a chromium salt, such as chromium nitrate, chromium phosphate, or chromium chloride, ore is subjected to alkali oxidizing roasting to prepare a sodium dichromate solution, sulfuric acid is added to the sodium dichromate solution, which is then subsequently reduced with an organic substance to produce a chromium sulfate solution, caustic soda or soda ash is added thereto to form a precipitate of chromium hydroxide or chromium carbonate, which is subsequently subjected to filtration and water washing, and then nitric acid, phosphoric acid, or hydrochloric acid is added thereto for dissolution. In another known method, chromium ore is reduced in an electric furnace using a carbon reductant to produce high-carbon ferrochromium, the high-carbon ferrochromium is extracted with sulfuric acid, the resulting solution is electrolyzed to obtain metallic chromium, and nitric acid or hydrochloric acid is added to the metallic chromium to produce chromium nitrate or chromium chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, with respect to chromium nitrate, a production method is also known, which includes the steps of preparing a mixed solution of chromium trioxide and nitric acid by mixing nitric acid with chromium trioxide in a stoichiometric amount required to produce chromium nitrate or more, and adding an excessive amount of an organic reducing agent composed of an alcohol, an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid, which is derived from a carbohydrate selected from monosaccharides, disaccharides, and starches, or a mixture of these, to the mixed solution of chromium trioxide and nitric acid prepared in the previous step to reduce chromium trioxide, thereby producing chromium nitrate (for example, refer to Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With respect to chromium chloride, the present applicant has proposed a method in which an aqueous solution of chromic acid is allowed to react with an organic reducing agent capable of substantially completely decomposing into carbon dioxide gas and water by reaction with hydrochloric acid and chromic acid, thereby producing a high-purity aqueous solution of chromium chloride (for example, refer to Patent Document 3).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among known methods, in the method in which chromium hydroxide is dissolved in nitric acid, it is very difficult to perform water washing of the precipitate of chromium hydroxide produced by adding caustic soda or soda ash to chromium sulfate, and it is not possible to remove impurities, such as sodium and sulfate salts, in chromium hydroxide. This problem remains to be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the method according to Patent Document 2, for example, mixing of nitric acid with chromium trioxide in a stoichiometric amount required to produce chromium nitrate or more is effective in decreasing the amount of hexavalent chromium. However, depending on the conditions, the added reducing agent may react with nitric acid instead of chromium trioxide, resulting in generation of NOx. Consequently, not only a de-NOx system may be required, but also sudden reaction may cause dangerous conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an aqueous solution of a chromium salt and a method for producing the same, which can overcome the various disadvantages associated with the known techniques described above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, the object described above is achieved by providing an aqueous solution of a chromium salt which is characterized in that the oxalic acid content is 8% by weight or less relative to chromium.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention will be described below by way of its preferred embodiments. An aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is characterized in that the level of oxalic acid, which is an organic substance, is low. More particularly, if the level of oxalic acid is low, it has been found that when an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is used for surface treatment of metal, a product with a highly glossy finish can be obtained. In the technique according to Patent Document 2 described above, in order to reduce hexavalent chromium, an organic reducing agent having a large number of carbon atoms, such as starch or glucose, is used, and as a result, the level of oxalic acid present in the aqueous solution is higher than that of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The oxalic acid content in an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is 8% by weight or less, preferably 6% by weight or less, and more preferably 4% by weight or less, relative to chromium. Furthermore, preferably, oxalic acid is not substantially contained in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt. The oxalic acid content can be measured, for example, by ion chromatography. The lower limit of the oxalic acid content in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is not particularly limited. An extremely low level, i.e., substantially no content, of oxalic acid can be achieved using a production method that will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is also characterized in that the level of total organic carbon (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;TOC&#x201d;) is low. As a result of research by the present inventors, it has been found that if the TOC level is low in addition to the low level of oxalic acid described above, when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is used as a surface treatment agent for metal, a product with a more highly glossy finish can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;TOC&#x201d; refers to the total amount of C remaining as organic substances in the solution. In the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, the TOC level is low preferably at 4% by weight or less, and more preferably at 2% by weight or less, relative to chromium. Patent Document 2 describes that 0.3% by weight or more of TOC is required in an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate in order to ensure that hexavalent chromium is reduced to trivalent chromium. However, as a result of detailed research on the TOC conducted by the present inventors, it has been found that if the TOC content is increased, when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt is used as a surface treatment agent for metal, a satisfactory glossy finish cannot be obtained. If an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is produced by the method that will be described below, even if the TOC level is low, hexavalent chromium can be reliably eliminated. The lower limit of the TOC level in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is not particularly limited. If the production method described below is used, extremely low levels can be achieved, for example, 0.5% by weight in the case of chromium chloride, 0.5% by weight in the case of chromium phosphate, and 0.1% by weight in the case of chromium nitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The TOC in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention can be measured, for example, with a total organic carbon analyzer Model TOC 500 manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, in spite of the fact that the oxalic acid content is low and the TOC level is preferably low, substantially no hexavalent chromium is present in the aqueous solution. Consequently, the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is advantageous in that the environmental load is low.

If the specific gravity of the aqueous solution is in this range, disproportionation does not occur in the liquid even if stored for a long period of time, and crystals of chromium chloride are not easily precipitated, thus being preferable. In order to set the specific gravity in the range described above, for example, as will be described below, the molar ratio (Cl/Cr) of chlorine to chromium may be set to be 1 or more and less than 3.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to set the molar ratio of chlorine to chromium in the basic chromium chloride in the range described above, for example, the production method that will be described below may be used.</p>

In general, the concentration in terms of Cr is preferably 8.2% by weight or more, and particularly preferably 11.4% by weight or more. The upper limit of the concentration is not particularly limited, but is preferably 14% by weight, and particularly preferably about 13.5%. The concentration of basic chromium chloride can be easily adjusted by addition of dilution water, such as ion-exchanged water or pure water. Consequently, the aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride of the present invention is advantageous in that the concentration of chromium chloride can be freely adjusted depending on the intended use.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hexavalent chromium compounds are corrosive and oxidizing, and therefore, in aqueous solutions of chromium salts prepared using these compounds as starting materials, large amounts of impurity metal ions, in particular, Na and Fe, are inevitably mixed. In contrast, the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is characterized in that the content of these ions is extremely low. When such a high-purity aqueous solution of a chromium salt is used, in particular, as a starting material for a chromium catalyst in the production of chromium hydroxide, high-purity chromium hydroxide is advantageously obtained, which is preferable. The concentration of impurity metal ions is measured, for example, using ICP-AES.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With respect to the concentration of impurity metal ions in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt, the Na level is low preferably at 30 ppm or less, and more preferably at 20 ppm or less. The Fe concentration is preferably 20 ppm or less, and more preferably 10 ppm or less. Note that when the chromium salt is a chromium chloride, the concentration is calculated on the basis of 40% by weight in terms of CrCl<sub>3</sub>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is also characterized in that the solution contains substantially no free counter-ions not bonded with Cr, for example, chlorine ions and nitrate ions. The fact that substantially no free counter-ions are contained is preferable because precipitation of crystals can be advantageously suppressed when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention in high concentration is stored for a long period of time. The term &#x201c;high concentration&#x201d; refers to the concentration of 40% of Cr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, for example, when the chromium salt is a chromium nitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention can be preferably used, for example, in applications of surface treatment of metal and catalysts. In particular, when used for surface treatment of metal, a product with a highly glossy finish is advantageously obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferred methods for producing an aqueous solution of a chromium salt according to the present invention will now be described. First, a preferred method for producing an aqueous solution of chromium chloride, as an example of the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, will be described. The production method includes adding an organic reducing agent to an aqueous solution of chromic acid to reduce part of the chromic acid in advance in the first stage of reaction, and then mixing hydrochloric acid and the organic reducing agent and adding the mixture to the reaction solution to complete the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First, the aqueous solution of chromic acid, which is a raw material, is prepared, for example, by a process in which sodium chromate obtained by alkali oxidizing roasting of chromium ore is used as a starting material and subjected to various purification steps to produce chromium trioxide, and the resulting chromium trioxide is dissolved in water. In the aqueous solution of chromic acid thus prepared, the content of impurities, such as Fe, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ni, Mo, and W, is extremely low compared with that of an aqueous solution of chromic acid prepared using, as a raw material, chromium hydroxide or chromium carbonate obtained by adding caustic soda or soda ash to chromium sulfate, or an aqueous solution of chromic acid prepared by dissolving high-carbon ferrochromium in nitric acid or hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The aqueous solution of chromic acid must be a solution in the reaction system, and at the initial stage of reaction, chromium trioxide may be used. However, in many cases, water is added thereto for dissolution, and the resulting aqueous solution is used. The concentration of the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited, but is preferably in a general range of 20% to 60% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The organic reducing agent to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited as long as it substantially completely decomposes into carbon dioxide gas and water in the reduction reaction, which will be described below. Examples of the organic reducing agent that may be suitably used include monohydric alcohols, such as methanol; and dihydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and trimethylene glycol. Other examples of the organic reducing agent include monosaccharides, such as glucose; disaccharides, such as maltose; and polysaccharides, such as starch. However, if saccharides having a large number of carbon atoms are used, organic decomposition products tend to remain, and it is not easy to decrease the oxalic acid content. It is also not easy to decrease the level of TOC containing oxalic acid. Therefore, in this production method, a monohydric or dihydric alcohol, which is a reducing agent capable of easily suppressing generation of oxalic acid and decreasing the TOC level, is preferably used. Use of a monohydric or dihydric alcohol is also advantageous in that a substantially stoichiometric reduction reaction is easily carried out. From these standpoints, a lower alcohol (e.g., an alcohol having 4 or less carbon atoms), in particular, methanol, ethylene glycol, or trimethylene glycol, is preferably used, and in particular, methanol is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The organic reducing agent may be directly added without dilution to the aqueous solution of chromic acid, or may be diluted with water before addition. When the organic reducing agent is diluted with water, preferably, the concentration of the organic reducing agent is set at about 10% to 30% by weight in view of operationality and controllability of reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the hydrochloric acid to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid together with the organic reducing agent, hydrochloric acid for industrial use can be used, and either synthetic hydrochloric acid or by-product hydrochloric acid may be used. Hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 35% by weight and a specific gravity of 1.15 is usually used, although not limited thereto. For the purpose of the present invention, these various starting materials are preferably used in concentrations as high as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the first stage of reaction, the organic reducing agent is added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid to reduce part of the chromic acid in advance, and then hydrochloric acid and the organic reducing agent are mixed and added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid. The rate of addition in each step is not particularly limited. In a method in which an acid and an aqueous solution of chromic acid are mixed in advance and then an organic reducing agent is added thereto, such as the method described in Patent Document 2, during the production of chromium chloride, as the temperature increases due to reaction heat of oxidation-reduction reaction, chromyl chloride is generated, which is dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When methanol is for example used as the organic reducing agent, the reaction formula in this production method is as follows:

As described above, the addition is performed by the method in which the organic reducing agent is added to reduce part of the chromic acid in advance in the first stage of reaction and then a mixed solution of hydrochloric acid and the reducing agent is added. In this method of addition, a high level of control is not required and the relationship a&#x3c;b can be always maintained. Thus, the method is preferable in view of operationality. Thereby, an advantageous effect is obtained that chromyl chloride is prevented from being generated because of reaction of chromic acid and hydrochloric acid that is not bonded with trivalent chromium.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Addition of the organic reducing agent to the aqueous solution of chromic acid initiates oxidation-reduction reaction.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When an aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride is produced, hydrochloric acid is added in an amount of 1 mole equivalent to less than 3 mole equivalents based on the chromic acid.</p>

Preferably, the aging is performed for 30 minutes or more and at 90&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C. The main purposes of the aging process are to decrease Cr<sup>6+</sup> present in the solution to substantially zero and to set the oxalic acid content at 8% by weight or less relative to chromium. As necessary, the organic reducing agent is further added to completely reduce remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The order of addition of phosphoric acid (orthophosphoric acid) and the organic reducing agent to the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited. For example, phosphoric acid and the organic reducing agent may be added simultaneously and separately. Alternatively, phosphoric acid may be mixed with the organic reducing agent, and the mixture may be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid. Preferably, phosphoric acid is mixed with the aqueous solution of chromic acid in advance to increase the acidity in the reaction system, and then the organic reducing agent is added. Thereby, generation of oxalic acid can be further suppressed. As the phosphoric acid (orthophosphoric acid), phosphoric acid for industrial use can be used. Phosphoric acid with a concentration of 75% by weight or more is usually used, although not limited thereto.

With respect to the items not particularly mentioned in this production method, those described regarding the production methods of chromium chloride and chromium phosphate are appropriately applied. This production method is characterized in that nitric acid and an organic reducing agent are separately and simultaneously added to an aqueous solution of chromic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the nitric acid to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid together with the organic reducing agent, nitric acid for industrial use can be used, and either synthetic nitric acid or by-product nitric acid may be used.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Nitric acid and an organic reducing agent are simultaneously and separately added to an aqueous solution of chromic acid. The rate of addition of each of nitric acid and the organic reducing agent is not particularly limited. The term &#x201c;separately&#x201d; means that nitric acid and the organic reducing agent are added not in a mixed state. When the organic reducing agent and nitric acid are mixed, both react with each other to generate NOx, thus being dangerous. Furthermore, as in the method according to Patent Document 2, if a reducing agent is added to a mixed solution of nitric acid and chromic acid, depending on the conditions, the added reducing agent may react with nitric acid instead of chromic acid, resulting in generation of NOx. Consequently, not only a de-NOx system may be required, but also sudden reaction may cause dangerous conditions.</p>

Thereby, an advantageous effect is obtained that NOx is prevented from being generated because of reaction of the reducing agent and nitric acid that is not bonded with trivalent chromium. With respect to the relationship between a and b, more preferably, the ratio a/b is less than 1, and particularly preferably 0.9 or less.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this method, prior to the simultaneous and separate addition of nitric acid and the organic reducing agent, preferably, only the organic reducing agent is added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To a glass reactor equipped with a condenser, 251.6 g of water was fed and 253.1 g of chromium trioxide was further added thereto, followed by thorough stirring for dissolution, to prepare a 50% aqueous solution of chromic acid. Methanol was used as a reducing agent. In the first stage of reaction, a 20% aqueous solution of methanol prepared by adding 48.4 g of water to 12.2 g of 99.5% methanol was added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid using a metering pump at a rate of 1.0 g/min. This rate of addition allows 60.6 g of the 20% aqueous solution of methanol to be added in about one hour. Also note that 12.2 g of 99.5% methanol corresponds to a volume that reduces 30% of the chromic acid.</p>

This rate of addition allows 817.9 g of the mixed solution of methanol and hydrochloric acid to be added in 2 hours. During the reaction, 327.7 g of condensed water was extracted from the reaction system to perform concentration. After the addition of the mixed solution of the reducing agent and hydrochloric acid was completed, aging was continued for 30 minutes. The temperature in this process was 105&#xb0; C. After aging, remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup> was checked, and the aqueous solution of methanol was added. Aging was further continued. Disappearance of color of Cr<sup>6+</sup> was confirmed by a diphenylcarbazide method, which will be described below, and thus the reaction was considered to be complete.

Ethylene glycol was used as a reducing agent. In the first stage of reaction, a 20% aqueous solution of ethylene glycol prepared by adding 56.2 g of water to 14.3 g of 98.5% ethylene glycol was added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid using a metering pump at a rate of 1.2 g/min. This rate of addition allows 70.5 g of the 20% aqueous solution of ethylene glycol to be added in about one hour. Also note that 14.3 g of 98.5% ethylene glycol corresponds to a volume that reduces 30% of the chromic acid.</p>

This rate of addition allows 822.9 g of the mixed solution of ethylene glycol and hydrochloric acid to be added in 2 hours. During the reaction, 331.5 g of condensed water was extracted from the reaction system to perform concentration. After the addition of the mixed solution of the reducing agent and hydrochloric acid was completed, aging was continued for 30 minutes. The temperature in this process was 105&#xb0; C. After aging, remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup> was checked, and the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol was added. Aging was further continued. Disappearance of color of Cr<sup>6+</sup> was confirmed by the diphenylcarbazide method, and thus the reaction was considered to be complete. During the reaction, generation of chromyl chloride was not observed. The composition of the resulting aqueous solution of chromium chloride was as shown below.</p>

This rate of addition allows 830.5 g of the mixed solution of glucose and hydrochloric acid to be added in 2 hours. During the reaction, 337.0 g of condensed water was extracted from the reaction system to perform concentration. After the addition of the mixed solution of the reducing agent and hydrochloric acid was completed, aging was continued for 30 minutes. The temperature in this process was 105&#xb0; C. After aging, remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup> was checked, and an aqueous solution of glucose was added. Aging was further continued. Disappearance of color of Cr<sup>6+</sup> was confirmed by the diphenylcarbazide method, and thus the reaction was considered to be complete. During the reaction, generation of chromyl chloride was not observed. The composition of the resulting aqueous solution of chromium chloride was as shown below.</p>

About 40 ml of each sample was placed in 50-ml plastic containers and the containers were covered with lids. The containers were left to stand either in an environment of room temperature or in an environment of minus zero degree or less. Then, the presence or absence of crystals was visually observed. With respect to the presence or absence of crystals, even microcrystals were considered as crystals because of the possibility that they would grow as nuclei.

As a reducing agent, an 18% aqueous solution of methanol prepared by adding 119.2 g of water to 27.0 g of 99.5% methanol was used. The aqueous solution of methanol was added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid using a metering pump at a rate of 1.22 g/min. This rate of addition allows 146.2 g of the 18% aqueous solution of methanol to be added in two hours.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Twelve minutes after the start of addition of the aqueous solution of methanol, 470.6 g of a 67.5% aqueous solution of nitric acid was added separately from the aqueous solution of methanol at a rate of 3.92 g/min. This rate of addition allows the aqueous solution of nitric acid to be added in two hours, the same as the time of addition of the aqueous solution of methanol. After the addition of the aqueous solution of methanol was completed, the ratio a/b of the theoretical amount a of nitric acid to the theoretical amount b of methanol was 0.9. Twelve minutes after the addition of the aqueous solution of methanol was completed, the addition of the aqueous solution of nitric acid was also completed. Subsequently, aging was continued for 30 minutes. The temperature in this process was 105&#xb0; C. After aging, remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup> was checked, and the aqueous solution of methanol was added. Aging was further continued. Disappearance of color of Cr<sup>6+</sup> was confirmed by the diphenylcarbazide method, and thus the reaction was considered to be complete. During the reaction, generation of nitrous acid gas was not observed. The composition of the resulting aqueous solution of chromium nitrate was as shown below.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">To a glass reactor equipped with a condenser, 280.2 g of a 60% aqueous solution of chromic acid and 140.0 g of water were fed, followed by thorough stirring, to prepare a 40% aqueous solution of chromic acid. As a reducing agent, a 20% aqueous solution of ethylene glycol prepared by adding 121.9 g of water to 31.7 g of 98.5% ethylene glycol was used. The aqueous solution of ethylene glycol was added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid using a metering pump at a rate of 1.28 g/min. This rate of addition allows 153.6 g of the 20% aqueous solution of ethylene glycol to be added in two hours.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Twelve minutes after the start of addition of the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol, 470.6 g of a 67.5% aqueous solution of nitric acid was added separately from the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol at a rate of 3.92 g/min. This rate of addition allows the aqueous solution of nitric acid to be added in two hours, the same as the time of addition of the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol. After the addition of the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol was completed, the ratio a/b of the theoretical amount a of nitric acid to the theoretical amount b of ethylene glycol was 0.9. Twelve minutes after the addition of the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol was completed, the addition of the aqueous solution of nitric acid was also completed. Subsequently, aging was continued for 30 minutes. The temperature in this process was 105&#xb0; C. After aging, remaining Cr<sup>6+</sup> was checked, and the aqueous solution of ethylene glycol was added. Aging was further continued. Disappearance of color of Cr<sup>6+</sup> was confirmed by the diphenylcarbazide method, and thus the reaction was considered to be complete. During the reaction, generation of nitrous acid gas was not observed. The composition of the resulting aqueous solution of chromium nitrate was as shown below.</p>

During the reaction, 50 kg of condensed water was extracted from the lower part of the condenser to perform concentration. After the completion of reaction, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, seed crystals were added thereto, and stirring was continued day and overnight. The precipitated crystals were separated with a centrifugal separator, and 25 kg of crystals of chromium nitrate was recovered.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Chromate treatment solutions were prepared using the respective aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate obtained in Examples 3-1, 3-2, and 3-4 and Comparative Example 3-1. Chromate treatment was performed by dipping a zinc-plated steel sheet test piece in each chromate treatment solution, followed by drying. The degree of gloss after the treatment was evaluated. The results thereof are shown in Table 20 below. In Table 20, &#x229a; indicates very good gloss, &#x25ef; indicates good gloss, and x indicates poor gloss.</p>
