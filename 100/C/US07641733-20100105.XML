<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The subject invention relates, generally, to crystal growth and, more particularly, to ternary and quaternary homogeneous single crystals and to methods and apparatus for making such alloys.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors with variable band gaps (E<sub>g</sub>) and lattice constants are needed for numerous electronic and optoelectronic applications, including light emitting diodes, laser diodes, photodetectors, solar and photovoltaic cells, high speed switches, and the like. Directional solidification from the melt is by far the fastest, cheapest, most reliable, and, therefore, the preferred method for producing large scale, device grade, single crystal substrates. Unfortunately, only binary compounds (like GaAs, GaSb, and InP) have been successfully commercially produced in large quantities from melts having discrete energy band gaps and lattice constants. In principle, the band gap and the lattice constant can be tuned in ternary, quaternary, or higher order systems by adjusting the composition of the substitutional cations and anions. However, in practice melt-grown ternary and higher order compounds are compositionally inhomogeneous (see, e.g., Bachmann et al., &#x201c;Melt and Solution Growth of Bulk Single Crystals of Quaternary III-V Alloys&#x201d;, Progress in Crystal Growth and Characterization, 2(3):171-206 (1979)) and exhibit high density of defects, such as cracks, inclusions, precipitates, dendrites, and dislocations. These defects are due to several reasons, including large lattice mismatch between the constituent binaries, wide separation between the liquidus and solidus curves in the pseudo-binary phase diagrams, differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the binary compounds, and miscibility gaps.</p>

In this method, a crucible <b>3</b> containing a crystal growth seed <b>4</b> is pulled through a wide hot zone of a furnace having heater coils <b>2</b> or other heating elements. The semiconductor material contacting the crystal growth seed and which has already passed through the hot zone of the heater coils is solid. The remainder of the semiconductor material <b>5</b> located in the hot zone of the furnace is in the liquid state. Thus, the temperature in the hot zone of the furnace is maintained above the liquidus temperature of the binary semiconductor material. The temperature versus location plot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that the temperature in the hot zone is sufficient to maintain the semiconductor material in the hot zone in the liquid state.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ternary and quaternary semiconductor materials are currently produced in the form of thin layers by non-equilibrium growth techniques (from diluted solutions and vapor phase) on binary substrates using buffer layers to relieve misfit related stresses at the epilayer-substrate interface. One disadvantage of epitaxial technology is its high cost. In addition, the buffer layer technology is not optimized for all systems, and, often devices exhibit large leakage currents due to poor interfacial regions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present inventor has realized that a method of growing a multi-component single crystal having three or more elements with high quality and high growth rate may be obtained by growing the single crystal on a crystal growth seed from a multi-component melt, such as a ternary, quaternary or higher order (i.e., quinternary) melt. It should be noted that the crystal and melt do not necessarily have the same number of elements or components. The crystal growth seed is located in a crystal growth area of a vessel, such as a crucible or another suitable vessel. The vessel is separated into a crystal growth area and a synthesizing melt area by a thermal barrier. At least one opening connects the crystal growth area to the synthesizing melt area. A growth melt is formed in the crystal growth area of the vessel and a synthesizing melt is formed in the synthesizing melt area of the vessel. A solute, such as a solid or liquid solute is provided into the synthesizing melt, such that solute diffuses from the synthesizing melt into the growth melt through the at least one opening. The multi-component single crystal having three or more elements, such as a ternary or quaternary single crystal, is grown on the crystal growth seed. Preferably a temperature difference between the thermal barrier and a crystal growth surface over the crystal growth seed is 1&#xb0; C. or less, and a temperature difference between the thermal barrier and a location in the synthesizing melt where the solute is provided is 20&#xb0; C. or more.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an apparatus <b>11</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus <b>11</b> contains a heating element <b>12</b> and a vessel <b>13</b>. The heating element <b>12</b> may be any suitable heating element which provides heat to the vessel <b>13</b>. For example, the heating element <b>12</b> may comprise a furnace, such as a furnace with resistive heating coils. Alternatively, the heating element <b>12</b> may comprise an RF heating element containing RF coils, or a radiative energy heating element <b>12</b>, such as a heating element containing one or more heating lamps or flash lamps. The vessel <b>13</b> may be any vessel for single crystal growth from a melt, such as a crucible made of quartz, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) or other thermally tolerant materials which are chemically compatible with the melt and solid materials used in the process. Preferably, the vessel <b>13</b> is vertically oriented.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A crystal growth seed <b>14</b> is located at the bottom of the vessel <b>13</b>. The seed preferably comprises a single crystal of the same material as that being grown in the vessel. Thus, for example, to grow a ternary Ga<sub>0.75</sub>In<sub>0.25</sub>Sb single crystal, a Ga<sub>0.75</sub>In<sub>0.25</sub>Sb single crystal seed <b>14</b> is provided on the bottom of the vessel <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, a multi-component melt <b>15</b> is located in the vessel. Preferably, the melt <b>15</b> has as many elements or components as in the single crystal being grown on the seed <b>14</b>. Thus, for a ternary single crystal, a ternary melt may be used. For a quaternary single crystal, a quaternary melt may be used. However, if desired, a higher order melt may be used for a lower order single crystal, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,613,162 (quaternary melt for ternary crystal) and E. V. Kunitsyna et al., 142 Appl. Surf. Sci. 371-374 (1999) (quinternary melt for quaternary crystal), both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A thermal barrier <b>16</b> is located in the vessel <b>13</b>. The thermal barrier <b>16</b> may comprise a plate or a second vessel, such as a second crucible, of a smaller diameter than the vessel <b>13</b>. The thermal barrier <b>16</b> is made of any suitable low thermal conductivity (i.e., thermally insulating) material and has a sufficient thickness which prevents or significantly decreases thermal conductivity from one side of the barrier <b>16</b> to the other side of the barrier <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> may comprise a silica or quartz plate having a thickness of about 0.25 to 1 cm, such as 0.5 cm, for example. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> comprises at least a portion of a second vessel, such as a second crucible <b>116</b>. The second vessel <b>116</b> has a smaller diameter or width than the first vessel <b>13</b>, such that the second vessel <b>116</b> fits inside the first vessel <b>13</b>. a gap of 1-2 mm exists between the sidewalls of the vessels <b>13</b> and <b>116</b>. For example, the second vessel <b>116</b> may have a hollow bottom wall <b>21</b>, containing a 2-3 mm hollow space between the inner and outer bottom wall surfaces. The hollow wall <b>21</b> forms a low thermal conductivity thermal barrier. Alternatively, the second vessel <b>116</b> is made from a low thermal conductivity material, such as silica or quartz, and has a sufficiently thick bottom wall which forms a low thermal conductivity thermal barrier. For example, the bottom wall may be a 0.25 to 1 cm thick quartz or silica wall. The synthesizing melt <b>19</b> is located in vessel <b>116</b>. As support rod and wire structure <b>26</b> may be used to move and support the vessel <b>116</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more openings <b>17</b> connect the lower area or zone <b>18</b> of the vessel <b>13</b> to an upper area or zone <b>19</b> of the vessel <b>13</b>. The openings <b>17</b> may comprise one or more openings located in the thermal barrier <b>16</b>, one or more openings located between the thermal barrier <b>16</b> and an internal side wall of the vessel <b>13</b>, or a plurality of openings located both in the thermal barrier <b>16</b> and between the thermal barrier <b>16</b> and an internal side wall of the vessel <b>13</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, if the thermal barrier <b>16</b> comprises a plate, then the openings <b>17</b> comprise one or more spaces between the edges of the plate <b>16</b> and the internal sidewall of vessel <b>13</b>. In another example, if the thermal barrier <b>16</b> comprises at least one wall of an internal vessel or crucible <b>116</b>, then the openings may comprise one or more openings in the bottom wall of such internal vessel or crucible.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the melt <b>15</b> is present in the vessel <b>13</b>, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> separates the melt <b>15</b> into a crystal growth melt area or zone <b>18</b> and a synthesizing melt area or zone <b>19</b>. The thermal barrier <b>16</b> substantially prevents thermal transfer between the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> and the growth melt <b>18</b> but allows solute <b>20</b> transport from the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> to the growth melt <b>18</b> by solute diffusion through the at least one opening <b>17</b>. Therefore, the size of the openings <b>17</b> is preferably maintained as small as possible to allow the solute diffusion from area <b>19</b> to area <b>18</b> without substantial thermal transfer from area <b>19</b> to area <b>18</b>. Preferably, the opening(s) <b>17</b> has a width (or diameter for round openings) of 2 mm or less, such as 1-2 mm for example. In a vertically oriented vessel <b>13</b>, crystal growth seed <b>14</b> is located on a bottom of the vessel <b>13</b>, the synthesizing melt area <b>19</b> is at a top of the vessel and the crystal growth area <b>18</b> is located between the seed <b>14</b> and the synthesizing melt area <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A solute <b>20</b> is provided into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. In one preferred aspect of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the solute is in a solid state. However, the solute <b>20</b> may be in a liquid or semi-solid state, as will be described in more detail below. Preferably, the solute <b>20</b> comprises a material having a higher melting point than that of the melt <b>15</b>. Preferably, the solute <b>20</b> comprises a binary material while the melt <b>15</b> comprises a ternary or quaternary material having a lower melting point.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, when the crystal growth seed <b>14</b> and the growth melt <b>18</b> comprise a ternary material having a compositional formula A<sub>1-x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C, the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> comprises a ternary material having a compositional formula A<sub>1-y</sub>B<sub>y</sub>C, where x&#x3e;y, then solute <b>20</b> comprises a binary material having a compositional formula AC. In this case, when the element A is depleted from the growth melt <b>18</b> into the single crystal being grown on the seed <b>14</b>, then the solute provides a sufficient amount of element A into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. Element A then diffuses from the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> through the openings <b>17</b> into the growth melt <b>18</b> to keep the growth melt composition about the same as that of a liquidus composition corresponding to a composition of the crystal being grown (i.e., solidus composition). The growth rate of the crystal is depended on the solute saturation of the synthesizing melt. For example, for a GaInSb single crystal, A comprises gallium, B comprises indium and C comprises antimony. For a GaInAs single crystal, A comprises gallium, B comprises indium and C comprises arsenic. For a lithium niobate single crystal, A comprises lithium, B comprises niobium and C comprises oxygen (i.e., to form lithium oxide and niobium pentoxide compositions). In general for ternary alloy single crystals, A comprises a first metal element, B comprises a second metal-element and C comprises a semi-metal or non-metal element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The solid solute <b>20</b> may be provided into the synthesizing melt by any suitable method. For example, one or more chunks of the solid solute <b>20</b> may be placed or dropped into the synthesizing melt, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, the solute <b>20</b> is provided into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> by repeatedly (i.e., periodically) dipping the solid solute <b>20</b> into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> and removing the solid solute <b>20</b> from the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. For example, the solid solute <b>20</b> may be dipped into the synthesizing melt for 10 seconds to 2 minutes at a frequency of once every 5 minutes to once every hour, such as for 1 minute every 30 minutes. The duration and frequency of the solute dipping are selected to achieve the desired crystal growth rate and saturation conditions (which are a function of the solute dipping duration and frequency). The solute dipping conditions depend on various process parameters, such as the materials of the solute, the melt and the single crystal, as well as the temperature of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The solute <b>20</b> may be dipped into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> by any suitable method. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the solute <b>20</b> may be located in a solute feeder vessel <b>22</b> having at least one opening <b>23</b> which is dipped into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. The opening <b>23</b> may be 2-5 mm wide, for example. The vessel <b>22</b> may be a wire mesh basket or a crucible with openings, where are made of a material which will not deform in the synthesizing melt, such as a silica crucible shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The vessel <b>22</b> is moved down toward the melt <b>19</b> and up out of the melt <b>19</b> either by hand or mechanically. For example, the vessel <b>22</b> may be attached to a rod or other support which is moved along a vertical axis by a motor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the vessel <b>22</b> comprises a basket with one or more holes which is attached to a steel rod <b>24</b> by a molybdenum wire <b>24</b>A. A gap of about 2-5 mm remains between the vessel <b>22</b> and the vessel <b>13</b> and its components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, the solid solute may be attached to a handle <b>24</b> which supports the solid solute <b>20</b> while the solute is dipped into and removed from the synthesizing melt. The handle <b>24</b> may be moved vertically either manually or mechanically. For example, one or more solid solute <b>20</b> rods may be attached to sides of the handle <b>24</b>, such as a silica rod, with molybdenum wire <b>24</b>B at the top of the solute rods, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The silica rod <b>24</b> may also have a bottom support <b>24</b>C to prevent slippage of the solute rods. Alternatively, the solid solute <b>20</b> rod may be grown or formed with a &#x201c;T&#x201d;-like shape (i.e., having a wider upper portion than lower portion or having notches below the upper portion), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. The solid solute <b>20</b> rod is then attached to a handle <b>24</b> comprising a steel ring <b>24</b>D attached to a steel rod <b>24</b>E. The ring <b>24</b>D slips around the narrow part of the solid solute <b>20</b> rod, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. The solid solute <b>20</b> rod is then suspended from the ring <b>24</b>D by the wider upper portion of the solid solute <b>20</b> rod which is wider than the diameter of the ring <b>24</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If desired, a liquid or a semi-solid solute <b>20</b> may be used instead of a solid solute <b>20</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7D-F</figref>, a liquid solute feeder vessel <b>120</b> may be used to provide the liquid solute into the melt. The liquid solute feeder vessel <b>120</b> does not need to actually contact the melt <b>19</b> or to move in a vertical plane. For example, the vessel <b>120</b> may be a crucible made of a material the same as or similar to that of the vessel <b>13</b>. The vessel <b>120</b> may be heated by a heater to maintain the solute in the liquid state.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The vessel <b>120</b> preferably comprises a liquid solute container <b>121</b> containing an outlet or nozzle <b>122</b>. In one aspect of this embodiment, the outlet or nozzle is located on the sidewall of the container <b>121</b>. The container <b>121</b> is filled with the liquid solute <b>20</b> to a level below the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> in the sidewall of the container <b>121</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, a liquid displacer <b>123</b>, such as a rod or bar made of the same or similar material as the stirrer <b>25</b>, moves vertically in the container <b>121</b> to displace the liquid solute <b>20</b>. The displaced liquid solute <b>20</b>, such as solute <b>20</b> drops, are provided into the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> because the displacer <b>123</b> causes the liquid solute <b>20</b> level in the container <b>121</b> to rise above the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> in the container <b>121</b> sidewall. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, the liquid solute <b>20</b> is provided from the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> in vessel <b>13</b>. The vertical movement of the displacer <b>123</b> is correlated to the exact amount of liquid solute <b>20</b> that flows through the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Of course other liquid solute vessel <b>120</b> designs may be used. For example, the nozzle <b>122</b> may be omitted and the displacer <b>123</b> may cause the solute <b>20</b> to flow over the upper edge of the container <b>121</b>. Alternatively, the displacer <b>123</b> may be omitted and the amount of solute <b>20</b> provided into the synthesizing melt may be controlled by a high temperature valve. In this case, the outlet or nozzle <b>122</b> may be located in the bottom wall of the container <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that while a single solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> has been illustrated in the Figures, more than one solute vessels <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> may be provided in the crystal growth apparatus. The plurality of vessels may contain the same or different solute. For example, for a quaternary GaInAsSb melt, separate GaSb and GaAs solutes may be provided from separate vessels into the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the plural solute vessels <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> may be used to form a boule containing two or more regions stacked in the axial direction of the boule which have different characteristics. For example, the plural solute vessels may be used to form a boule with one or more p-n junctions (i.e., a p-type region contacting an n-type region), a boule containing regions of materials with different doping concentration (i.e., heavily doped, medium doped, lightly doped and/or intrinsic regions), a boule containing regions of different single crystal materials, and/or a boule containing regions of different relative concentrations of elements in ternary or quaternary materials, stacked in the axial direction of the boule.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The boule may have one or more types of these regions in any combination, where the term &#x201c;type&#x201d; includes: i) doping type (p or n); ii) doping concentration type (heavy, medium, light or intrinsic); iii) material type (such as AlGaSb, GaAs and/or GaSb, for example); and iv) relative element concentration type (i.e., Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Sb and Ga<sub>1-y</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Sb, where 0&#x3c;x, y&#x3c;1 and x does not equal y, which can be generalized to A<sub>1-x</sub>D<sub>x</sub>E and A<sub>1-y</sub>D<sub>y</sub>E (where the concentration of group III element is varied), or AD<sub>1-x</sub>E<sub>x </sub>and AD<sub>1-y</sub>E<sub>y </sub>(where the concentration of group V element is varied, such as GaAs<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>x </sub>and GaAs<sub>1-y</sub>P<sub>y</sub>) for ternary materials where A, D and E are elements found in ternary materials). In other words, a single crystal boule may have two or more regions with different characteristics, where all of the regions with different characteristics may be of the same or different types. Thus, a boule may be provided with some or all semiconductor regions of a semiconductor device without requiring epitaxial semiconductor layer deposition, such as CVD, MBE, sputtering, etc. semiconductor layer deposition, over a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, a boule may be provided with p+/p/n/n+ regions stacked together in the axial direction to form a solar cell, a photodetector or a light emitting device, such as an LED or a laser diode. The differently doped regions (by doping type and doping concentration type) may also be made from different semiconductor materials and/or may have different relative concentrations of elements. The boule is then sliced and electrodes are attached to the heavily doped regions to form a completed semiconductor device. The different regions do not include a boundary between the regions which is found in devices in which one layer is epitaxially grown over another layer or substrate. Furthermore, while antimonide III-V materials are used in illustrative examples, the boule may contain other III-V materials, such as nitride, arsenide and/or phosphide materials, as well as other semiconductor systems, such as II-VI materials.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The formation of regions with different characteristics in a boule may be conducted by placing a first solid or liquid solute in a first solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> and by placing a second solid or liquid solute with different characteristics from the first solute in a second solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b>. Then, a boule with different characteristic regions stacked in the axial direction is formed by alternately providing the solute from each vessel into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. The solute vessels <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> may be separately provided into the vessel <b>13</b> containing the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> by first lowering the first solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> into vessel <b>13</b> while the second solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> is raised out of vessel <b>13</b>, followed by raising the first solute vessel out of vessel <b>13</b> and lowing the second solute vessel into vessel <b>13</b>. If desired, there may be three or more solute vessels <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> to form three or more regions having different characteristics. Each solute vessel <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> contains a solute with a different characteristic(s) from the solute(s) in the other vessel(s) <b>22</b>, <b>120</b>, where the different characteristics may be of the same or different type.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the heating provided by the heating element <b>12</b> is controlled such that a temperature difference between the thermal barrier <b>16</b> and a growth surface over the crystal growth seed <b>14</b> (i.e., between points x<b>1</b> and x<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is 1&#xb0; C. or less, such as 0.5&#xb0; C. or less. In other words, the temperature variation across the growth melt <b>18</b> is kept to one degree Celsius or less. Therefore, the growth melt area <b>18</b> is preferably maintained as small as possible. Preferably, the thermal barrier (i.e., the lowest portion of the barrier) <b>16</b> is located 1 cm or less, such as 0.5 cm or less, from the multi-component single crystal surface facing the thermal barrier during the growth of the multi-component single crystal. Therefore, the height of the growth melt is preferably 0.2 to 1 cm, such as 0.2 to 0.5 cm. However, this distance may be greater than 1 cm if the heating element <b>12</b> is controlled to provide a temperature variation of less than one degree Celsius across a growth melt having a height greater than 1 cm. The crystal growth melt <b>18</b> is preferably maintained at a temperature such that the seed <b>14</b> is maintained at the single crystal alloy's solidus temperature, with a one degree or less variation across the growth melt <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the heating provided by the heating element <b>12</b> is controlled such that a temperature difference between the thermal barrier and a location in the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> where the solute <b>20</b> is provided (i.e., between points x<b>3</b> and x<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is 20&#xb0; C. or more, such as 20 to 50&#xb0; C. In other words, the temperature gradient across the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> is preferably greater than 20 degrees Celsius from the bottom of the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> (located at the top of the thermal barrier <b>16</b>) to the top of the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> where the solute <b>20</b> is dipped.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The synthesizing and growth melts are preferably mixed during crystal growth by any suitable method to maintain homogeneous melt composition distribution and to reduce formation of solute pockets. Preferably, the synthesizing melt is mixed in first mixing step, and the growth melt is mixed in a second mixing step different than the first mixing step. For example, the first mixing step may comprise mixing the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> using a stirrer <b>25</b> located in the synthesizing melt during the crystal growth method while the second mixing step comprises rotating the vessel <b>13</b> using an accelerated crucible rotation (ACRT) method. In other words, the vessel <b>13</b> is periodically accelerated and decelerated in its rotation about its axis in the ACRT method to mix the growth melt <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the stirrer <b>25</b> located in the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> while the vessel <b>13</b> rotates about its axis mixes the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. The stirrer <b>25</b> may comprise one or more plates or baffles attached to a supporting rod <b>26</b>. Preferably, a gap of 2-3 mm is provided between the stirrer <b>25</b> and the vessel <b>13</b> or <b>116</b>. The supporting rod <b>26</b> may also support a plate type thermal barrier <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The rod <b>26</b> may move the plate <b>16</b> and baffles <b>25</b> together. Alternatively, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> and stirrer <b>25</b> may be supported by different, mutually exclusive supporting members.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The stirrer <b>25</b> may rotate and/or move in one or more directions, such as in vertical and/or horizontal directions, in the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>, or it may remain stationary in the melt <b>19</b>. Furthermore, if the thermal barrier <b>16</b> comprises a portion of an inner crucible <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, then the inner crucible <b>116</b> may be rotated about its axis to mix the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. A motor (not shown) may be used to move and to rotate the stirrer or the inner crucible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the inner crucible <b>116</b> or the plate shaped thermal barrier <b>16</b> can be oscillated back and forth in the vertical direction by 1-2 mm to help transport the solute <b>20</b> from the top of the melt to the bottom of the melt without creating significant temperature fluctuation. While the solute <b>20</b> will be transported faster by this mechanism, if the movement is such that only the liquid in the opening(s) <b>17</b> gets displaced, which corresponds to movement of 1-2 mm, significant temperature fluctuation will not occur at the growth interface. This movement increases the growth rate by enhancing the solute transport rate from the point it was dissolved in the synthesis melt <b>19</b> to the point it is supposed to reach in the growth melt <b>18</b>. However, the vertical oscillatory movement should not exceed a few millimeters because this will cause a temperature fluctuation due to excessive liquid exchange between the synthesizing and growth melts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If desired, a melt displacing material may be placed into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> to decrease the volume of the synthesizing melt. The melt displacing material may comprise a rod or plate of material which does not dissolve in the synthesizing melt, such as a graphite, quartz or silica rod.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to obtain a single crystal having a substantially uniform axial compositional profile, as the single crystal grows in size, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> remains substantially stationary (i.e., is kept in the same horizontal plane or is periodically raised and lowered by 1-2 mm) while the vessel <b>13</b> is lowered at about the same rate that as the crystal growth rate. In this case, the crystal growth surface remains at the same horizontal level and is thus maintained at the same temperature during growth.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to obtain a single crystal having a uniform radial but a variable axial compositional profile, as the single crystal grows in size, the vessel <b>13</b> remains in the same horizontal plate while the thermal barrier <b>16</b> is raised at about the same rate as the crystal growth rate. In this case, the crystal growth surface moves up to a higher position with respect to the heater <b>12</b> as the crystal grows. The changing temperature at the crystal growth surface with time will result in a variable axial compositional profile. In this case, the single crystal will have a gradually increasing amount of solute element (i.e., element A) in the axial direction away from the crystal growth seed. In other words, a GaInSb single crystal will have a gradually increasing Ga concentration in an axial direction away from the seed. The term &#x201c;axial&#x201d; refers to the growth direction of the single crystal, while the term &#x201c;radial&#x201d; refers to a direction perpendicular to the growth direction.</p>

Element A (i.e., Ga in a GaInSb melt) diffuses through the openings <b>17</b> in the thermal barrier <b>16</b> to the growth melt <b>18</b> to initiate ternary crystal growth on a ternary ABC crystal growth seed. In the case where the thermal barrier <b>16</b> comprises a bottom wall of an inner crucible <b>116</b> rather than a flat plate, the BC binary melt may remain in the narrow space between the inner wall of the outer crucible <b>13</b> and the outer wall of the inner crucible <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, dopants can be added to the melt prior to crystal growth, or dopants can be added to the mixture of the melt starting materials prior to melting the starting materials. Suitable dopants include any material which may impart desirable properties (e.g., desirable electrical properties) to the ternary or quaternary crystals, such as any material which is commonly used in conventional binary, ternary, quaternary alloys. Examples of such dopants include an n-type dopant, such as tellurium, selenium, and sulfur, and p-type dopants, such as zinc, cadmium, and the like. Preferably, the n-type or p-type dopant is used in an amount effective to make a semiconductor crystal a n-type or p-type semiconductor, respectively. Suitable amounts of these types of dopants can range from about 1 ppm to about 1000 ppm, preferably from about 10 ppm to about 100 ppm, per unit weight of the melt composition.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> illustrate a method according to another embodiment of the present invention. In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a binary crystal growth seed may be used to grow a ternary or quaternary single crystal growth seed, and if desired, a further ternary or quaternary single crystal containing boule on the ternary or quaternary single crystal growth seed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the apparatus <b>111</b> contains a vessel <b>113</b> having an optional narrow lower portion <b>131</b>. Portion <b>131</b> may be 5 to 10 mm wide (i.e., have a diameter of 5-10 mm). A small binary single crystal growth seed <b>114</b>, such as a 5-10 mm seed, is placed into the lower portion <b>131</b>. Alternatively, any other size binary seed, such as a 5 to 100 mm seed, for example a 50 to 100 mm seed, may be used and the narrow portion <b>131</b> may be omitted. For example, a &#x3c;100&#x3e; single crystal InSb seed may be used to grow a GaInSb seed and single crystal. The vessel <b>113</b> also preferably contains a sloped portion <b>132</b> connecting the narrow lower portion <b>131</b> to a wider upper portion <b>133</b>. The upper portion <b>133</b> may have a width or diameter which corresponds to the width or diameter of the boule to be grown. For example, portion <b>133</b> may have a width of 50 to 100 mm. The other parts of the apparatus <b>111</b> and vessel <b>113</b> are the same as those of apparatus <b>11</b> and vessel <b>13</b> described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the vessel <b>113</b> is filled with a binary melt <b>115</b>. For growing an ABC type ternary seed and/or crystal, the binary melt comprises an BC melt, as described with respect to the previous embodiments. Then, a BC type binary single crystal seed <b>124</b>, such as an InSb seed, is grown in the sloped portion <b>132</b> of the vessel <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, after the grown binary seed <b>124</b> fills the entire sloped portion <b>132</b>, the AC type solid solute <b>20</b>, such as GaSb, is provided into the binary melt <b>115</b> to form a ternary melt ABC, such as GaInSb. The ternary melt <b>115</b> is provided with a low concentration of the solute to form a graded composition ternary seed <b>14</b> located on the binary seed <b>124</b>. The ternary seed has a variable or graded axial composition A<sub>1-x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C, where x decreases with increasing seed height. After the ternary seed reaches a desired composition (i.e., a desired value of x), a ternary single crystal boule having the same axial composition is grown on the seed. Alternatively, the seed <b>14</b> is removed from vessel <b>113</b> and sliced or cut, and the cut portions of the seed <b>14</b> are reused in later crystal growth runs.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method of growing the ternary seed from the binary seed is preferably the same as the method of growing a ternary crystal, except for the following. Preferably, the vessel <b>113</b> rotates about its axis, but is not moved down during seed growth. However, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> is moved up to accommodate the growing seed. Once the seed growth is completed, the vessel <b>113</b> is moved down during crystal growth while the thermal barrier <b>16</b> remains stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The single crystal made by the method of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is preferably located in a boule. In other words, at least a portion of the boule comprises a single crystal. An upper portion of the boule that solidifies last may contain a polycrystalline region. The boule is preferably, but not necessarily cylindrical in shape. Preferably, the single crystal boule diameter (i.e., width or radial dimension) is at least 50 mm, such as 50 to 100 mm. Larger diameter boules may also be formed. Preferably, the single crystal growth rate is 2 to 5 mm/hr, such as 3 to 4 mm/hr for a single crystal having a diameter of at least 50 mm. The boule preferably has a length (i.e., axial dimension) of at least 50 mm, such as 50 to 200 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The ternary or quaternary single-crystal composition or alloy has the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>y</sub>D<sub>1-y </sub>where x and y are the same or different and are in the range of 0 to 1, such as between 0.1 and 0.9, but where both x and y do not equal to zero or one. Preferably, the single-crystal has a volume of greater than about 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than 2 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than about 5 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than about 10 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than about 20 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than about 30 cm<sup>3</sup>, such as greater than about 40 cm<sup>3</sup>. In addition, the single crystal is preferably substantially free from crystal defects. The crystal is considered to be &#x201c;substantially free from crystal defects&#x201d; when it has fewer than about 10<sup>6 </sup>crystal defects (e.g., cracks, inclusions, precipitates, dendrites, and/or dislocations) per cm<sup>2</sup>, such as when it has fewer than 10<sup>5 </sup>crystal defects per cm<sup>2</sup>, such as when it has fewer than 10<sup>4 </sup>crystal defects per cm<sup>2</sup>, such as when it has fewer than 10<sup>3 </sup>crystal defects per cm<sup>2</sup>, such as when it has fewer than 100 crystal defects per cm<sup>2</sup>. The dislocation may be measured using an etch pit density method and the other defects, such as dendrites or inclusions may be measured by chemical etching using various acid-base mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, at least a portion of a ternary single crystal boule, such as a cross sectional slice having an axial length of 0.5 to 2 mm, has a diameter of at least 50 mm, a defect density, such as a dislocation density, of less than 100 cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and a radial compositional variation of less than 1%. For example, a cross sectional slice having an axial length of 0.5 to 1 mm, has a diameter of 50 to 100 mm, a dislocation density of 50 to 100 cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and a radial compositional variation of 0.5 to 1%, such as 0.2 to 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In other words, the boules have radially uniform compositions and axially uniform compositions over at least part of their length (i.e., in the growth direction). From such boules, one can readily produce homogeneous single-crystal alloy boules having radially and axially uniform compositions by slicing the boule (generally in a direction perpendicular to the growth direction) to sever the compositionally uniform portion from the seed crystal and from any compositionally non-uniform portions.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the finished boule is preferably cut or sliced by any suitable technique to form one or more single crystal wafers. For example, the wafer may have a thickness of less than 1 mm, a diameter of at least 50 mm, a dislocation density of less than 100 cm<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>and a radial compositional variation of less than 1%. For example, a 0.5 to 0.7 mm thick wafer preferably has a diameter of 50 to 100 mm, a dislocation density of 50 to 100 cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and a radial compositional variation of less than 0.5 to 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A solid state device is then formed on the wafer. If the wafer comprises a semiconductor wafer, such as a GaInSb or GaInAs wafer, then preferably a semiconductor device is formed on this wafer. The semiconductor device may comprise a photovoltaic device, such as a solar cell (including multi-junction solar cell) or a photodetector, a light emitting device, such as a laser or a LED, an electronic device, such as a transistor or another solid state device. If the wafer comprises a ceramic wafer, such as a lithium niobate wafer, then a solid state device, such as a SAW device or an optical modulator device, may be formed on the wafer. Other ternary and quaternary ceramic and semiconductor boules and wafers may also be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Other devices and layers may also be formed on the wafer. For example, they include thermophotovoltaic (&#x201c;TPV&#x201d;) devices for generation of electricity, high frequency devices, detectors for monitoring environmental pollution, trace chemicals, and toxic or other types of gases, for example, in industrial environments and in fire detection devices. By altering the relative amounts of the elements present in the ternary and quaternary alloys, the band gap can be tuned for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ternary and quaternary alloys can also be used as substrates for other alloys. For example, using a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb ternary alloy as a substrate, one can grow another alloy layer (e.g., InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y</sub>) thereon. The alloy layer (e.g., InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y</sub>) will also be substantially free from crystal defects. In contrast, when one uses prior art methods of first growing Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb on a binary (e.g., GaSb) substrate and then growing a layer of InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y </sub>on the resulting composition to form an InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y</sub>/Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb/GaSb structure, the InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y </sub>is not substantially free from crystal defects. It is believed that the failure to produce InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y</sub>/Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb/GaSb structures having a InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y </sub>that is free from crystal defects is caused by defects in the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb layer of the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb/GaSb composition on which the InAs<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y </sub>is grown. By being able to provide a ternary (e.g., Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb) alloy substantially free from crystal defects, the need to use Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb/GaSb is eliminated. Furthermore, high quality Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb/GaSb compositions in which x is greater than about 0.1 are cannot be made using the methods of the prior art because growing Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb (in which x&#x3e;0.1) on GaSb results is so many crystal defects that the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb is subject to mechanical failure. In contrast, using the methods of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, there is no need for a binary substrate and Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb having x greater than 0.1 can be produced. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, by increasing the value of x in Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb, one can shift the emission wavelength of infrared lasers to longer wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, an infrared laser which employs a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb alloy having, for example x greater than about 0.1, such as greater than 0.15, such as greater than about 0.2, may be provided. The Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb alloy can also include one or more dopants. For example, the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb alloy can be uniformly doped throughout with Te. The Te-doped Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb alloy can also be doped with zinc, preferably in a near-surface region so as to create a p-n junction. This near-surface doping with zinc can be carried out using standard doping techniques, such as by exposing the surface of the Te-doped Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>Sb alloy to zinc vapor.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, the methods of the preferred embodiments of the present invention provide multi-component single crystals with a high yield and at a low cost. These crystals are substantially or completely crack and inclusion free. The crystals have a low dislocation density and low strain. The crystals may be formed into compositionally homogeneous, large diameter wafers. The following elements and features of the method and apparatus of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are believed to provide each of the above described advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Crack-free single crystals are achieved by avoiding constitutional supercooling. This means that crystal growth rate is lower than the rate at which excess constituents rejected at the melt-crystal interface (due to segregation) are mixed back into the growth melt. This is achieved by forced convective mixing, such as by ACRT, in the growth melt <b>18</b> near the melt-crystal interface.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Inclusion free crystals are achieved if the growth melt <b>18</b> is kept homogeneous at all times. This is also achieved by forced convective mixing, such as by ACRT, in the growth melt <b>18</b> near the melt-crystal interface.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Single crystallinity is maintained if the rate at which nuclei precipitate near the melt-crystal interface is slower than the rate at which the crystal grows. This is provided by controlling the solute feeding to the melt-crystal interface at all times during the crystal growth. In addition, constitutional supercooling should be avoided as described above. This is achieved by controlling the supersaturation level in the growth melt <b>18</b> to be close to that required for equilibrium growth, as well as by forced convective mixing, such as by ACRT, in the growth melt <b>18</b> near the melt-crystal interface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Low dislocation density and strain can be achieved if the growth takes place under a low temperature gradient. This is achieved by a small temperature gradient near the melt-crystal interface, such as a temperature gradient of less than 1 degree Celsius in the growth melt <b>18</b>, and by cooling the crystals in a low gradient after solidification.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">High yield refers to obtaining wafers of the same composition from a single ingot or boule. This is achieved when the crystal has same composition along the axial or growth direction by replenishment of the melt with the melt constituents (i.e., by providing the solute <b>20</b> into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>) to maintain the same melt composition during the entire growth. At the same time, the ingot or boule should be completely single crystal in nature. Thus, the melt replenishment should be done in a controlled fashion to avoid supersaturation of the melt with the replenished constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Low cost relates to the growth rate of the crystal and the volume of starting melt versus the volume of final crystal. Thus, a low cost crystal growth method consumes the entire melt during the growth and rapidly transports the dissolved constituents (replenishing elements or compounds) to the growth interface by forced convection. In addition, rapid dissolution of the replenished constituents (solute) is needed. Thus, the dissolution of the solute preferably occurs in a melt zone that is always undersaturated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A compositionally homogeneous wafer means uniform composition in the radial direction (i.e., in the wafer plane perpendicular to the growth or axial direction). This is achieved by a planar melt-crystal interface (isotherm) during growth. This can be achieved by balancing the heat transfer at the melt-crystal interface by a combination of temperature gradient imposed by the heater and the forced convective mixing in the growth melt. At the same time, temperature fluctuations due to forced convection in the growth melt (leading to composition fluctuation and local constitutional supercooling) should eliminated. This can be achieved by having a shallow growth melt <b>18</b> with close to isothermal conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Large diameter wafers are highly desirable for commercial applications. This may be achieved by the optimization of the heat and mass transport processes between various melt zones during growth for the length scales of interest. This is dictated by the design of the apparatus set-up and the process parameters. Specific examples of these parameters are provided in the specific example section below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The apparatus and method of the preferred embodiments of the present invention contains the following preferred features or elements that provide the conditions described above.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A solute <b>20</b> feeder <b>22</b> is used to replenish the melt <b>15</b> with its constituents, which may be used to keep the composition of the growth melt <b>18</b> uniform with time for growth of crystals with a uniform axial (i.e., non-graded) composition. The synthesizing melt <b>19</b> composition changes with time for uniform and non-uniform (i.e., graded) axial composition crystals. The solute feeder <b>22</b> is preferably dipped into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> periodically to avoid melt supersaturation by excessive dissolution of the solute and thereby precipitation in the regions anywhere else in the melt <b>15</b> except at the melt-crystal interface. The amount of solute <b>20</b> present in the melt <b>15</b> at any time is such that it can lead to supersaturation and growth (by precipitation of nuclei) only at a temperature corresponding to the growth melt <b>18</b> crystal interface temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The synthesizing melt <b>19</b> is always kept well below the solubility limit of the solute <b>20</b> in the solvent (melt). This is desirable to ensure that whenever the solute <b>20</b> is dipped in the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>, it dissolves rapidly. Therefore, a large temperature gradient, such as a gradient of at least 20&#xb0; C., is maintained between the top of the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> and the bottom of the synthesizing melt <b>19</b>. Since the solubility of the solute <b>20</b> increases with temperature, the region where the solute <b>20</b> dissolution occurs should be at a higher temperature than other regions of the melt. At the same time, the solute feeder <b>22</b> is preferably dipped into the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> periodically to avoid melt supersaturation by excessive dissolution of the solute and thereby precipitation in the regions anywhere else in the melt <b>15</b> except at the melt-crystal interface at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Mixing the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> by forced convection allows rapid transport of the dissolved solute <b>20</b> to the growth melt-crystal growth interface. This allows the process to maintain a high growth rate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Since there is a temperature gradient between the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> region where the solute <b>20</b> is dissolved and the growth interface, any forced convection used for transporting solute may thermally destabilize the growth interface and lead to constitutional supercooling by rapid dissolution and re-growth of interfaces. Therefore, the thermal barrier or separator <b>16</b> is provided between the growth melt <b>18</b> and the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> to reduce or eliminate this effect.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The synthesizing melt <b>19</b> should always be richer in solute <b>20</b> content than the growth melt <b>18</b> (due to segregation). The transport of solute <b>20</b> between the two melts <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> maintains a uniform crystal composition. Since one needs to avoid heat transfer between the synthesizing <b>19</b> and growth <b>18</b> melt areas while transporting solute, there should not be any forced convection in the opening or channel <b>17</b> between the two melts <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. Provided that the thermal barrier <b>16</b> is not moved vertically by 1-2 mm as described above, solute diffusion should be the only mechanism in the opening or channel <b>17</b> between the two melts <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. Hence, the thickness of the thermal barrier <b>16</b> separating the two melts <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> should be relatively small, such that while heat transfer is avoided, mass transport by diffusion takes less time.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The growth melt should be mixed by forced convection so that the rejected species at the growth interface (due to segregation) mix back into the growth melt and are used in absorbing the solute fed from the synthesizing melt. Forced convection is also desirable to achieve a planar melt-crystal isotherm (interface) useful for uniform alloy composition on the wafer plane. ACRT is very effective in achieving both of these conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">There should not be any significant temperature fluctuation in the growth melt <b>18</b>. This can be enforced by having a shallow growth melt such that the temperature gradient between the top and the bottom of the melt is very small, such as less than one degree Celsius. A &#x201c;near isothermal&#x201d; growth melt is desirable since a temperature difference is needed to create supersaturation at the melt-crystal interface for actual crystal growth.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, the crystal growth method described above enables high growth rates for single crystals with uniform composition. The solute dissolution is controlled such that supersaturation can occur only at the growth interface. The nature of forced convection in the synthesizing melt <b>19</b> (by stirrer <b>25</b>) and in the growth melt (by ACRT) ensures rapid transport of dissolved species to the growth interface. The thermal instability at the growth interface due to forced convection is avoided by having a thermal barrier <b>16</b> between two melt areas <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Ternary semiconductor alloys or compositions which can be produced using the method of the preferred embodiments of present invention include those having the formula ABC, where A and B are Group III elements and C is a Group V element; where A is a Group III element and B and C are Group V elements; where A and B are Group II elements and C is a Group VI element; or where A is a Group II element and B and C are Group VI elements.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Quaternary semiconductor alloys or compositions which can be produced using the method of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include those having the formula ABCD, where A and B are Group III elements and C and D are Group V elements or where A and B are Group II elements and C and D are Group VI elements.

Furthermore, ceramic quaternary compositions may also be made.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Suitable semiconductor ternary melts that can be used in the method of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include those which include two Group III elements (e.g., aluminum, gallium, and indium) and one Group V element (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony); those which include two Group V elements and one Group III element; those which include two Group II elements (e.g., zinc, cadmium, and mercury) and one Group VI element (e.g., sulfur, selenium, and tellurium); and those which include two Group VI elements and one Group II element.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The materials used to form the melt can vaporize at the high temperatures typically used to form the melt and/or at which the crystal is grown. In such situations, it can be advantageous to encapsulate the melt. This technique is commonly referred to as liquid encapsulation. Briefly, an encapsulant is layered over the melt materials, either before or after the melt is formed. The encapsulant, having a melting point significantly lower than the melt, melts and forms a liquid layer on the surface of the melt. This liquid layer prevents evaporation of the melt materials and, thereby, prevents unexpected changes to the composition of the crystal. Suitable encapsulants include boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) glass and various low vapor pressure salts, such as metal halide salts, combinations of two or more alkali metal halide salts (e.g., LiCl/KCl and NaCl/KCl), or combinations of alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal halide salts (e.g., NaCl/CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The salts may be removed from the grown crystal by placing the encapsulated grown crystal into hot water to dissolve the salts.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The following specific examples are provided for illustration only and should not be considered limiting on the scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A commercial InSb &#x3c;100&#x3e; oriented seed of 5 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length was inserted into a quartz (silica) crucible designed to grow single crystals using a vertical Bridgman technique. The crucible was filled with InSb polycrystals and LiCl&#x2014;KCl alkali halide salt for melt encapsulation and coating the crucible walls. The crucible was placed in the crystal growth chamber along with other components such as solute feeder and stirrer-thermal barrier plate structure. The solute feeder basket was filled with a polycrystalline GaSb rod. The crucible with InSb as well as the other solute feeder basket and other components were placed outside the heater zone of the furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The growth chamber was evacuated to 1 millitorr of vacuum and flushed with inert gas such as argon or hydrogen several times before filling the chamber with the inert gas. In this example, argon was used as the inert gas and a pressure of approximately 1.2 atmosphere was used during the entire growth.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The furnace was heated to a maximum temperature of 625&#xb0; C. The temperature gradient of the furnace around 525&#xb0; C. was 15&#xb0; C./cm and was approximately 5&#xb0; C./cm close to 600&#xb0; C. The actual temperature gradient in the melt (in the latter case) was approximately 2&#xb0; C./cm due to heat conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">After the furnace temperature stabilized, the crucible was slowly raised into the furnace such that the entire crucible was heated to at least 400&#xb0; C. enabling the salt to melt and coat the entire crucible wall. The crucible was then raised slowly until the InSb polycrystals melted and filled the space in the crucible above the seed. The crucible was then slowly raised by 1-2 mm to remelt the InSb single crystal seed to promote single crystal growth.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The crucible was then rotated in an accelerated crucible rotation (ACRT) fashion. The ACRT scheme comprised of accelerating the crucible rotation from 10 rpm to 75 rpm in 30 seconds followed by a de-acceleration from 75 rpm to 10 rpm in 30 seconds. The crucible rotation was unidirectional.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">To grow the InSb single crystal, the crucible was lowered into the cold zone of the furnace at a rate of 3 mm/hr. InSb was grown in the conical region of the crucible (&#x2dc;3 cm in height) from the seed. After this the crucible lowering was stopped and the crucible was held stationary in a temperature gradient zone of the furnace. The stirrer along with the thermal barrier structure was lowered into the melt and left stationary at a position approximately 0.5 cm from the crystal interface. The melt height of InSb was approximately 6-7 cm when the structure was dipped in the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The solute feeding basket with the GaSb polycrystal was then dipped in the top of the melt. The solute feeder was dipped for 1 minute every 30 minutes. After the dipping, the basket was raised few mm away from the melt surface. The crucible kept rotating with the ACRT scheme mentioned above while the stirrer with the thermal barrier plate structure remained stationary in the melt. Then the stirrer-thermal plate structure was raised from the crystal interface at a rate of 3 mm/hr while the crystal grew. The crucible was kept stationary during this growth period. The solute feeder basket was also raised with the same rate as the stirrer-thermal plate structure.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">During the entire period, a compositionally graded GaInSb was grown starting from a InSb composition and with increasing gallium content. After the crystal grew for 2.5 to 3 cm, the composition of the solid had approximately 45 mol % GaSb and 55 mol % in Sb.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the crucible was started lowering at a rate of 3 mm/hr while the stirrer-thermal plate structure was left stationary at approximately 0.5 mm from the crystal interface. The solute feeding was continued as before. An approximately 1 cm length of the crystal with constant composition of approximately Ga<sub>0.45</sub>In<sub>0.55</sub>Sb was grown. At the end of this period, the solute feeder was kept separated from the melt and the stirrer along with the thermal plate was removed the melt. The remaining melt was solidified by cooling the furnace at a rate of 2&#xb0; C./hr until 500&#xb0; C. and then to room temperature over a period of 50 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The crystal was removed from the salt by dissolving the salt in hot water. The crystal was sliced along the growth direction along the central core of the crystal. Wafers were also sliced perpendicular to the growth direction. The wafers were 0.5-0.7 mm thick. They were lapped and polished to mirror shining on both sides. Electron microprobe x-ray analysis was used to study the spatial alloy composition of the slices. Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to evaluate the spatial alloy bandgap of the slices.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the axial composition profile of the graded GaInSb crystal from the InSb binary seed. During the formation of the crystal, for the portion of the crystal from 1.3 to 3.4 cm, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> was in the same horizontal plane and the vessel <b>13</b> was lowered. For the portion of the crystal from 3.4 cm to about 7 cm, the thermal barrier <b>16</b> was raised while the vessel <b>13</b> remained in the same horizontal plate to achieve a graded axial composition. For the portion of the crystal from about 7 cm to about 8 cm, the thermal barrier remained in the same horizontal plane while the vessel <b>13</b> was lowered to achieve a uniform axial composition.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the radial gallium profiles of two GaInSb wafers. No cracks were seen in crystal grown using this method. The radial compositional variation of Ga in these wafers was less than 1% (i.e., about 0.5%), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In contrast, to grow crack free crystals using conventional vertical Bridgman, the growth rate for these compositions would in the range of 0.1-0.4 mm/hr. The preferred embodiments of the present invention enables the growth of high quality crystals at approximately 3-4 mm/hr.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In example 2, a similar growth configuration was used to example 1, except that temperature gradient in the growth melt was twice of that in example 1. This is due to higher set-point (maximum) temperature being 680&#xb0; C. instead of 625&#xb0; C. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the radial gallium composition fluctuates more than in example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The differences between this example and example 1 are: (a) no thermal barrier plate was used in this example and (b) temperature gradient in the growth melt was more than twice of that in example 1. This is due to higher set-point (maximum) temperature being 710&#xb0; C. instead of 625&#xb0; C. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the radial gallium composition fluctuates significantly. Furthermore the melt-crystal interface is curved giving rise to a non planar gallium profile.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In example 4, a similar growth configuration was used to example 1, except that there was no ACRT mixing of the growth melt. The temperature gradient was exactly the same as in example 1. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the radial gallium profile is significantly flat except for few discrete locations where it is believed that inclusions were located due to non-mixing of the growth melt.</p>
