<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An ink for ink jet recording includes water, a water-soluble organic solvent, a water-insoluble color material, a dispersant, and a compound expressed by the following chemical formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R&#x2014;O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;H &#x2003;&#x2003;(I)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where R is an alkyl group having a carbon number of 25 to 150 and n is from 2 to 100. The ink not only can maintain performances such as storage stability and high-quality recording images, but also can effectively prevent nozzle clogging, exhibit good dispersion stability, and achieve a high redispersion property that ensures stable ejection both during long continuous operation and after stopping the operation for a long time.

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to ink for ink jet recording in an ink jet recording system. Specifically, the present invention relates to ink for ink jet recording that uses a water-insoluble color material as a color component for a piezo ink jet system and can effectively prevent nozzle clogging of a recording head and have excellent storage stability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Water-based ink for ink jet recording is used generally in the form of a water-soluble dye solution or a liquid obtained by dispersing a water-insoluble color material into water or an aqueous solution including a water-soluble organic solvent. When water resistance is required, hydrophobic fibers are dyed by ink jet textile printing, or hydrophobic fibers or resin film products are dyed by sublimation transfer after ink-jet printing on media such as papers, ink for ink jet recording that includes a water-insoluble color dye is used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Characteristics required for the ink for ink jet recording that includes a water-insoluble color material are as follows: (1) ejection stability while preventing nozzle clogging; (2) storage stability; (3) high-quality recording images resulting from uniformity in the direction of ink ejected, the ejection amount, and the dot shape; (4) quick drying and fixation; and (5) high print density.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an ink jet recording system, ink should be ejected from thin nozzles as ink droplets. Therefore, (1) is particularly important. When the ink jet recording system is of the drop-on-demand type, the ejection of ink from the nozzles is stopped temporarily even during continuous operation. This may lead to an ejection failure in long continuous operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unlike a water-soluble dye, the water-insoluble color material tends to cause clogging, e.g., because precipitates (aggregates) are generated by the degradation of dispersion stability and the solvent evaporates from the nozzles. In particular, when the apparatus is not operated for a long-time, clogging is likely to occur due to evaporation of the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To suppress evaporation of the solvent, a low-volatile solvent or humectant is added. Alternatively, a hydrotropic agent is added so that even if a portion of the solvent included in the ink evaporates, the ink can be redispersed when it comes into contact with ink supplied further from an ink chamber. Examples of the humectant include glycols such as glycerin and polyethylene glycol. Examples of the hydrotropic agent include urea and urea compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when used in a small amount, these additives are not effective, and when used in a large amount, the ink viscosity is raised or the surface tension is significantly changed, moreover, the drying property of printed materials is degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the above problems, e.g., JP 8-41396 A discloses that a solvent including water, glycerin, and propylene glycol is used to prevent nozzle clogging and to achieve quick-drying of the ink on a recording media after printing. In this document, when recording can be performed even after the nozzles are left for 120 seconds or more, the ink is regarded as being &#x201c;excellent&#x201d;. However, the document is not sufficient to solve the issues of redispersion property and ejection performance of the ink after stopping the operation for a long time, e.g., after the nozzles are left overnight.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">JP 10-251579 A discloses a technique to prevent clogging by using an ethylene glycol lower fatty acid ester compound that can improve the solubility of a dye in the ink and serve as a humectant.

However, as is evident from a paragraph [0016] of the document, which states that &#x201c;a water-soluble dye is preferred&#x201d;, the dispersion stability and redispersion property of the color material can be a problem when this technique is applied to a water-insoluble color material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unlike polyoxyethylene higher alkyl ethers used in a conventional ink for ink jet recording, the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I) of the present invention includes an alkyl group having a carbon number of not less than 25. The upper limit of the carbon number of the alkyl group generally is not more than 150. As a conventional example, natural or synthetic alcohol compounds have been commercially available. However, these compounds normally include an alkyl group having a carbon number of about 12 to 18. The above-described JP 2000-265098 A discloses a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether compound that includes an alkyl group having a carbon number of 14 to 23.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, when a water-insoluble color material is used as a colorant, it is not possible to achieve an ink composition with a high redispersion property even by using the polyoxyethylene higher alkyl ethers having a carbon number of less than 25.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail. In a compound expressed by the following chemical formula (I) of the present invention, R is an alkyl group having a carbon number of 25 to 150. The ink composition for ink jet recording can achieve a high redispersion property by using a compound that includes R having a carbon number of not less than 25. In view of solubility in a water-based ink composition, a compound that includes R having a carbon number of not more than 150 is appropriate. The carbon number of R (alkyl group) is preferably 30 to 50, and more preferably 30 to 35. Further, n ranges from 2 to 100, preferably 10 to 50, and more preferably 20 to 50. The alkyl group can be either linear or branched-chain, but a linear alkyl group is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In view of solubility in water, HLB is not less than 4, preferably not less than 10, and more preferably ranges from 14 to 18.

</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The compound expressed by the chemical formula (I) is used preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 8 wt %, more preferably 0.1 to 6 wt %, and even more preferably 0.2 to 4 wt % with respect to the total weight of ink. By adjusting the amount of the compound within the range of 0.1 to 8 wt %, the ink viscosity is not excessively high, so that the ink can provide an intended effect.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When polyester fibers or film products are dyed by sublimation dyeing after printing on papers, the disperse dye and the solvent dye are preferred. When polyester fibers are dyed directly by ink-jet textile printing, the disperse dye is particularly preferred because of its good affinity with and fixation onto the fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The dispersant of the present invention disperses the water-insoluble color material into a water-based medium. There is no particular limitation to the dispersant as long as it can be used with the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I). For example, an anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a high-molecular surfactant can be used as the dispersant. The anionic surfactant and the nonionic surfactant are suitable for the dispersion of the disperse dye or the solvent dye, and the anionic surfactant is particularly preferred. The high-molecular surfactant is suitable for the dispersion of the pigment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Examples of the anionic surfactant include naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate, lignin sulfonates, special arylsulfonate formaldehyde condensate, creosote oil sulfonate formaldehyde condensate, and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to the above materials, the ink of the present invention may include various additives, if necessary, so as not to impede the attainment of the object of the present invention. Examples of the additives include a surface control agent, a hydrotropic agent, a pH regulator, a viscosity modifier, a preservative, an antifungal agent, a light stabilizer, a chelating agent, an antifoaming agent, and an anti-curl agent.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When pigments are used as the water-insoluble color material, the ink may further include a binder.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Examples of the surface control agent include a fluorochemical surfactant, a polyether modified dimethylpolysiloxane, and acrylic polymers, and particularly the polyether modified dimethylpolysiloxane and the acrylic polymers are suitable for the present invention. These surface control agents are useful to control the surface tension of the ink so that a material for forming the ink flow passage is wetted easily when it comes into contact with the ink. The amount of the surface control agent is 0.05 to 1 wt %, and preferably 0.1 to 0.5 wt % with respect to the total weight of ink. When the amount is less than 0.05 wt %, the above effect is reduced. When the amount is more than 1 wt %, the above effect is not enhanced anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A method for producing an ink for ink jet recording of the present invention is not particularly limited. For example, a preferred method includes the following:</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(1) A water-insoluble color material, a compound expressed by the chemical formula (I), a dispersant, and water are mixed and stirred to prepare predispersions. In this case, a water-soluble organic solvent or any of the above additives may be added as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(2) The predispersions are dispersed in a wet mill (e.g., a sand mill), thereby producing color material dispersions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(3) To the color material dispersions are added water and a water-soluble organic solvent or, if necessary, any of the above additives, and then the concentration is adjusted. The resultant liquid is filtered, e.g., through a filter paper before use.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this method, the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I) may be added either when the predispersions are pulverized or when the concentration is adjusted. Alternatively, the compound may be divided and added in both cases.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In view of workability, it is preferable that the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I) is added in the form of about 10 to 15 wt % of an aqueous solution that is prepared beforehand. In this case, water to be added may be reduced by the amount corresponding to the water contained in the aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The average particle size of the water-insoluble color material obtained by the above method is preferably not more than 1 &#x3bc;m, and more preferably ranges from 0.02 to 0.2 &#x3bc;m.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The following tests were conducted on each of the inks in Working Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3. Table 2 shows the results.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(1) Redispersion Property Test</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A thin coating of ink composition (0.5 g) was applied to the surface of a watch glass (&#x3c6;90 mm), and the watch glass was placed in a drier that was kept at 60&#xb0; C. and left for 1 hour. Then, the watch glass was taken out of the drier, and a peripheral portion of the dried ink was washed gently with a small amount of water from the outside of the peripheral portion. The state of the ink was observed and evaluated as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Evaluations: &#x25ef; indicates that the ink is redispersed immediately without any aggregation; &#x394; indicates that aggregates in the form of a small thin film are partially generated, but not attached to the glass surface; and ? indicates that a considerable amount of aggregates is generated and remain attached to the glass surface.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(2) Continuous Ejection Stability Test</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Using a commercially available large-format ink jet plotter (&#x201c;JV2-130&#x201d; (piezo-type) manufactured by Mimaki Engineering, Co., Ltd), continuous printing was performed under the conditions of 720&#xd7;720 dpi resolution, single color, solid printing, and 1200 mm print width until some print errors such as missing dots were caused.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Evaluations: &#x25ef; indicates that no clogging occurs after 5 hours or more; &#x394; indicates that clogging occurs between 30 minutes and 1 hour; and ? indicates that clogging occurs within 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">(3) Ejection Performance after Long-time Non-operation</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The ink jet plotter continued to operate for 30 minutes under the above conditions, and then stopped for 48 hours. After normal cleaning, a print test was conducted again to examine whether or not printing was performed normally under the same conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Evaluations: &#x25ef; indicates that normal printing can be performed by operating one head cleaning in the manner specified for the ink jet plotter; &#x394; indicates that several cleaning cycles are necessary; and ? indicates that further cleaning cycles are not helpful in performing normal printing.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As can be seen from the results, Working Examples are superior in redispersion property, continuous ejection stability, and ejection performance after long-time non-operation. However, Comparative Example 1, in which an anionic dispersant is used instead of the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I), is inferior in redispersion property, continuous ejection stability, and ejection performance after long-time non-operation. Comparative Examples 2 and 3, in which a nonionic dispersant is used instead of the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I), are likely to be a little bit better than Comparative Example 1, but are much worse than Working Examples of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Comparative Example 4, in which the compound expressed by the chemical formula (I) is used without a dispersant, is not suitable for ink jet recording because of its poor storage stability.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An ink for ink jet recording of the present invention that uses a water-insoluble color material as a color component has the effects of not only maintaining required performances such as storage stability and high-quality recording images, but also achieving a high redispersion property, effectively preventing nozzle clogging, and ensuring stable ejection by normal cleaning both during long continuous operation and after stopping the operation of an apparatus for a long time.</p>
