<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention discloses a method, apparatus and method of manufacturing an apparatus; all to produce hydrogen gas, particularly synthesis gas. Preferred embodiments of the invention include an alpha alumina membrane which has been treated with a TiO<sub>2 </sub>wash coat on one side and has an active gamma alumina layer on an opposite side. A metal catalyst, preferably rhodium, is deposited within the pores of the alumina. Oxygen travels through the membrane and is activated before contacting methane on the other side of the membrane and forming synthesis gas through partial oxidation of the methane. Embodiments of the invention have a number of benefits including the high conversion rate of oxygen (100%), the separate feed streams of methane and oxygen which allow for optimal ratios to be used without danger of explosion, and the opportunity to vary the feed rates without changing the products formed. Normally gaseous hydrocarbons recovered from remote oil wells (e.g. offshore oil wells) can thus be converted to synthesis gas and then to normally liquid hydrocarbons via a Fischer-Tropsch type reaction. The normally liquid hydrocarbons are easier to transport away from the remote oil well than normally gaseous hydrocarbons.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a membrane and a method of preparing the membrane, the membrane being particularly, but not exclusively, useful in producing synthetic gas for use in Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquids production in the oil and gas exploration industry or for producing hydrogen for use as a fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While offshore oil production has risen slightly in recent years, natural gas (which mainly consists of methane) production has seen a marked increase. Natural gas is often extracted during the extraction of liquid hydrocarbons, such as oil, from the ground and is often undesirable due to the lack of infrastructure to transport the natural gas to an onshore location. The lack of infrastructure can be explained by the physical nature of natural gas which makes it difficult to transport safely and/or efficiently in its basic gaseous state. As a result the natural gas is often flared (ignited) causing economic waste and environmental concern. It would therefore be desirable to either convert the natural gas into some other substance which can be transported easily, or transport the natural gas in a liquid state. In this way, new field development will be more financially viable through the use of the extensive infrastructure and technology already in place in the offshore industry for transporting liquid hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to transport natural gas as a Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) in specifically constructed containers onboard vessels which have been adapted for such purposes. However, this has many disadvantages including; the need for expensive pressurising equipment which is difficult to scale down to suit smaller production fields, loss of gas during transportation (&#x201c;boil-off&#x201d;), danger posed in transit to vessel and crew by high pressure, highly flammable gases and the requirement to depressurise the LNG into a usable gaseous state at the customer end.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is considered that a better way of utilising offshore produced natural gas (CH4) is to convert it, on or in close proximity to the offshore production platform, into synthetic gas (syngas) which can in turn be used to produce gases, fluids and chemicals such as methanol, ammonia and importantly, crude oil that can be readily pumped through the same pipelines as the produced oil. Syngas comprises a mixture of carbon monoxide(CO) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By way of background information to the reader, conversion of syngas to liquid hydrocarbon is a chain growth reaction between carbon monoxide and hydrogen on the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst. The catalyst is either iron or cobalt based and the reaction is highly exothermic. The temperature, pressure, and catalyst determine whether a light or heavy syncrude is produced. For example at 330&#xb0; C. mostly gasoline and olefins are produced whereas at 180&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. mostly diesel and waxes are produced. There are two main types of Fischer-Tropsch reactors. The vertical fixed tube type has the catalyst in tubes that are cooled externally by pressurised boiling water. In large plants, several reactors arranged in parallel may be used, presenting energy savings. Another process uses a slurry reactor in which pre-heated syngas is fed into the bottom of the reactor and distributed into the slurry which consists of liquid wax and catalyst particles. As the syngas bubbles upwards through the slurry, it is diffused and converted into more wax by the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The heat generated is removed through the reactors cooling coils where steam is generated for use in the process. Again by way of background information to the reader, this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus if methane (or other gaseous hydrocarbons) could be converted to syngas and thereafter to liquid hydrocarbons, the transportation costs and difficulties outlined above would be mitigated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Synthesis gas can be made by partial oxidation of methane (although it is more usually made by the reaction of methane with steam under pressure.)</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A major safety problem with the partial oxidation of methane arises because methane and air (or oxygen) should be fed into the reactor at the same time and therefore there is the danger of an explosion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is known in the art that a reactor with relatively dense ceramic membranes that conduct oxygen can be used for syngas production (e.g. WO 98/48921 and WO 01/93987). These membranes generate syngas by avoiding direct contact between the oxygen and hydrocarbon feed, but this necessitates the use of very high temperatures in order to achieve the necessary oxygen flux. Moreover, being dense means that the membrane has to be as thin as possible, resulting in brittleness and crack formation, loss of efficiency and reduced operating service life. In some cases the membrane would need to be so thin that it would be unable to support its own weight and therefore impossible to use in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cost effective natural gas (methane) conversion to syngas for gas-to-liquids production would therefore be an important commercial development.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hydrogen can be used as a clean fuel. However, the amount of hydrogen that can be produced by using renewable natural energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro-power is currently not sufficient to satisfy demand. The utilisation of natural gas and/or the production of hydrogen from natural gas seen to be a viable alternative and the most realistic solution at least in the first half of this century [1, 2].</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An example of progress in the widespread utilisation of natural gas involves the development of small co-generation system using the micro-gas turbine. In addition, fuel cells are expected to be a highly-efficient power generating system. The fuel cells are anticipated to be deployed in residences in addition to the installation in electrical vehicles. Home-use of fuel cells can provide hot-water and electricity, simultaneously. To commercialise the stationary fuel cells, it is necessary to establish alternative hydrogen generation technology.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0062">A membrane apparatus <b>8</b> in accordance with the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and comprises a tubular membrane <b>10</b> and an outer tubular shell <b>16</b>. Two gas flow passages are thus formed which are substantially sealed off from each other. The first within a bore <b>14</b> of the membrane <b>10</b> and the second in the annulus <b>22</b> between the membrane <b>10</b> and the shell <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0063">The inner bore <b>14</b> of the modified membrane <b>10</b> may have some supporting struts <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These increase the structural strength of the modified membrane <b>10</b>. In operation, the struts <b>34</b> also change the flow pattern of oxygen flowing through the sidewall <b>13</b> of the membrane <b>10</b> by reducing the opportunity for the methane flowing through the inner bore <b>14</b> to pass directly through the centre of the modified membrane <b>10</b> inner bore without coming into contact with the modified membrane <b>10</b> surface. The struts <b>34</b> also increase the internal surface area per unit volume of the modified membrane <b>10</b>, and hence increase the opportunity for activation, compared to a completely hollow cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>b </i>the preparation of the membrane <b>10</b> layers will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0065">The process starts with the inorganic (preferably ceramic) coarse porous support <b>10</b>. Supports of this nature are now widely available and a wide variety of companies currently supply these base materials and a preferred support <b>10</b> comprises an alpha-alumina tube having 10 mm outer diameter and a 7 mm inner diameter, typically having a pore size of between 110 and 180 nm. The support <b>10</b> comprises a porous middle portion <b>11</b> which is typically around 300 mm in length, and two remaining non-porous portions <b>26</b> of about 25 mm in length at each end of the membrane <b>10</b>. The end portions <b>26</b> are made non-porous by glazing them with a sealant, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;BaO&#x2014;CaO at 1100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0066">The wash coat <b>28</b> is then applied to the outer cylindrical surface of the support <b>10</b> by dipping the support <b>10</b> into a substance such as TiO<sub>2</sub>. This wash coat <b>28</b> dipping step roughens the outer cylindrical surface of the support <b>10</b> and adds microporosity to the walls of the membrane catalysts <b>12</b>. (In operation the rough surface of the wash coat <b>28</b> forces the oxygen particles (not shown) to convolute around the raggedness of the wash coat <b>12</b> and serves to improve mass transfer of the limiting reactant (oxygen) to the catalytic sites&#x2014;this results in improved syngas yields).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0067">The oxygen flux control layer <b>30</b> is then applied to the inside surface of the inner bore <b>14</b> of the support <b>10</b>. This layer <b>30</b> should be inorganic to enable operation of the membrane <b>10</b> at high temperatures and may comprise a gamma alumina layer derived from a boehmite(AlO(OH)) solution with a concentration of 0.6 mol/L. The inner surface of the support <b>10</b> is exposed to the boehmite solution via dipping for about 2 minutes. The support is then air-dried overnight and then heated to between 700-750&#xb0; C. at a rate of 1&#xb0; C./min. It may be necessary to repeat this dipping-drying-firing sequence for up to a total of three cycles to achieve the required gamma-alumina layer thickness on the support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0068">The deposition of the catalysts <b>12</b> on the support <b>10</b> is achieved using an osmotic ionic exchange process, which will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0069">Osmotic Ionic Exchanged Catalyst Deposition:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0070">The catalysts <b>12</b> are prepared using either cationic or anionic exchange using RhNO3 or RhCl3.2H2O respectively in an organic medium (0.2 g/L) as precursors. Owing to the asymmetrical character of the membrane as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>(i.e. wash coat <b>28</b>+support <b>10</b>+gamma alumina layer (boehmite) <b>30</b>) different ways of introducing the catalysts <b>12</b> to the support <b>10</b> are utilised. In the first instance, the osmosis process involves immersing the outer surface of the partially modified membrane <b>10</b> in 6.0 molar sucrose solution, while the catalyst precursor solution (e.g. RhNO<sub>3 </sub>or RhCl<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) is circulated through the inner bore <b>14</b> of the partially modified membrane <b>10</b>. This configuration is reversed in the second instance with the immersion of the outer surface of the partially modified membrane <b>10</b> now in a catalyst precursor solution and the osmotic (sucrose) solution now circulated in the inner bore <b>14</b> of the partially modified membrane <b>10</b>. The membrane <b>10</b> is then washed using distilled water and subsequently dried by blowing dry air either through the inner bore of the now modified membrane <b>10</b> or across the outer cylindrical surface.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0071">Calcination (which involves heating the modified membrane <b>10</b> to a very high temperature and then passing Hydrogen through the modified membrane <b>10</b>) is then carried out under atmospheric pressure at 400&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Metallic (active) Rh (the catalyst <b>12</b>) is obtained by reduction of Rhodium ionic species using hydrogen at 400&#xb0; C. for 2 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0072">The modified membrane <b>10</b> characteristics may now be measured. This may be done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to show the degree of filling of the modified membrane <b>10</b> pore network and to estimate the gamma alumina (boehmite) layer <b>30</b> thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0073">Alternative materials may be selected. However it is important that the selected materials have similar thermal coefficients of expansion as adjacent layers. If there is difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the active porous layers and porous support layers, there is an advantage in selecting materials for the intermediate porous support layers, with expansion coefficients which gradually change from values near those for the active porous layer to values near those for the outer porous support layer. One way of achieving this is to prepare the intermediate layers from a mixture of the material used in forming active porous layer decreasing in successive porous support layers. For instance, porous support layer could contain 75% by weight of the material used in forming the active porous layer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0074">The above discussion does not exclude the use of identical materials in active porous layer and porous support layer. Such a material selection will eliminate chemical incompatibility and differential thermal expansion problems but typically entails sacrifices in strength and material cost.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0075">The number of porous support layers will depend on the porous radius of the adjacent active porous layer. They will vary from a single layer for active porous layer pore radii selected from the upper end of the specified range to four for pore radii selected from the lower end of the specified range.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0076">The surface area of a material determines many of its physical and chemical properties, including water retention capacity and reactivity with nutrients and contaminants. The BET Surface Area Analyser can be used to estimate the specific external surface of a solid by determining the volume of a specific gas that is absorbed under controlled conditions. The BET surface Area Analyser has typically been used in routine characterisation of various membrane materials and synthetic mineral analogues important in process engineering systems.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0077">In the context of the present invention, BET surface area analysis using nitrogen adsorption is used to estimate the pore size distribution in the modified membrane <b>10</b> and also to indicate values of porosity and pore volume. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDXA) surface analysis of the modified membrane <b>10</b> is used to confirm whether or not the modified membrane <b>10</b> forms a continuous gamma alumina network and the extent of any defects. It also provides elemental composition of the catalysts <b>12</b> and its relative dispersion. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is then used for chemical analysis of the modified membrane <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0078">It is recognised that the partial oxidation of methane may occur via two distinct mechanisms, i.e. direct partial oxidation or total oxidation followed by reforming reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0079">To convert methane to syngas a partial oxidation is required.

<p id="p-0056" num="0080">Should a full oxidation occur, the reaction products would be CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0081">The operation of the modified membrane <b>10</b> in the membrane apparatus <b>8</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0082">An oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supply <b>18</b> is fed into the outer bore <b>22</b> at one end of the membrane apparatus <b>8</b>, and a natural gas (which mainly comprises methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)) supply <b>20</b> is fed into the corresponding end of the inner bore <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0083">The partial pressure of the oxygen <b>18</b> is maintained at a higher pressure than that of the methane supply <b>20</b>, which results in the oxygen passing through the pores (not shown) of the modified membrane <b>10</b> from the outer bore <b>22</b> to the inner bore <b>14</b>. Upon doing so, the oxygen molecules come into contact with the catalysts <b>12</b> present in the sidewall <b>13</b> of the modified membrane <b>10</b>, which activates the oxygen molecules before contacting the methane present in the inner bore of the modified membrane <b>10</b>. This activation imparts sufficient energy on the O<sub>2 </sub>molecule so that it can react at relatively low temperatures without forming an oxygen ion.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0084">When the activated oxygen molecules come into contact with the methane molecules, syngas is instantly formed according to the following chemical reaction:
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0085">The produced syngas exits the membrane apparatus <b>8</b> from the other end of the inner bore <b>14</b> due to the natural pressure differential created by the methane supply <b>20</b>, such that a syngas flow <b>24</b> is created. Pneumatic control of the oxygen supply <b>18</b> flow rate allows different flow rates of the methane supply <b>20</b> to be used, since an increase in the pressure of the oxygen supply will result in a greater flux of oxygen through the pores of the modified membrane <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0086">In use a gas stream comprising the methane flows next to or through the catalyst impregnated layer <b>12</b>. The gamma alumina layer <b>30</b> on the bore side <b>14</b> enhances the reaction between permeated oxygen and the methane. Since the oxygen molecules have to diffuse to the bore side <b>14</b> of the gamma alumina layer <b>30</b> and the adjacent porous layer, the gaseous environment of the gamma alumina layer <b>30</b> at and near the bore is less reducing than in the outer porous layers. As a result a complete or partial oxidation reaction will take place here with some reforming occurring as gas moves away from the gamma alumina layer <b>30</b> respectively. It is advantageous to coat pores of the last porous support layer with the reforming catalyst such as Rh to induce some endothermic reforming as combustion products flow through the porous support layer. This will assist in removing the heat of the exothermic oxidation reaction from the surface of the active porous layer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0087">The gradient in oxygen activity in the porous layer will prevent damage to the gamma alumina layer <b>30</b> from exposure to very low oxygen partial pressures, thus permitting a greater degree of freedom in the selection of materials for these layers.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0088">Gas permeability through the modified membrane <b>10</b> can be measured by placing the end of the modified membrane <b>10</b> sample tightly against the ends of the outer tubular shell <b>16</b>, with a seal being formed therebetween by &#x2018;O&#x2019; rings <b>32</b>. A gas connection (not shown) of the outer tubular shell <b>16</b> is attached to a source of constant pressure. The predetermined pressure difference being used creates a stable flow of gas through the sidewall <b>13</b> of the membrane <b>10</b> sample, and is used to measure the flow rate, which is proportional to the gas permeability of the modified membrane <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0089">Multi-component selectivity can be obtained by measuring the individual species concentration in the feed and permeate respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0090">Analysis of the reactants and products are analysed using gas chromatography (GC) on-line using a 5 m &#x215b; inch molecular sieve column to determine methane, O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2 </sub>and CO. Any CO<sub>2 </sub>will be analysed using a separate 2 m long column of Porapak&#xae; QS. In this analysis, a thermal conductivity detector is also used. Water formed during the reaction is condensed in an ice trap and further removed by using a Drierite&#xae; trap.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0091">In order to calibrate the chromatograph, multi-component gas mixtures consisting of certified compositions of methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and oxygen were fed on one side of the modified membrane <b>10</b> (e.g. the outer bore <b>22</b>) and the streams entering and exiting the inner bore <b>14</b> were analysed using the Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) of a gas chromatograph.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0092">Other aspects investigated in testing the membrane <b>10</b> include the effect of operating temperature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), methane flow rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and composition of syngas yield and selectivity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-18</figref> show a variety of these results using such an apparatus. In each case, values of oxygen and methane conversions and the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0094">To investigate the initial reaction products of the CH<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>feed, experiments were carried out at low methane conversion rates and the products were analysed as detailed above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095">The oxygen feed flow rate was held constant at 75 ml/min and the methane feed flow rate was varied from 150 to 425 ml/min, giving a range of total feed flow rates from 225 to 500 ml/min. The higher total feed flow rate decreases the contact time of the reactants with the catalysts, thereby decreasing methane conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0096">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> it can be observed that for methane conversion above and below 15% the CO<sub>2 </sub>yield increases significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0097">The CO yield by contrast, increases for conversions lower than 20% having a slight decrease at conversions around 16% increasing again thereafter. The average CO yield is the highest average yield of any one product. The water yield follows the same profile as that for CO, but for methane conversions around 18% it decreases again, deviating from the CO yield. The average water yield is the lowest average yield of any one product. The hydrogen yield is a mirror image of the CO yield up to 16% methane conversion, rising considerably for higher conversion rates.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">In a second experiment, the feed flow rate of oxygen was varied from 15-75 ml/min whilst the flow rate of the methane was held constant at 150 ml/min giving reactions with total flow rates from 165-225 ml/min, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The temperature was 1023.15K. The methane conversion decreases proportionally with the increase in total flow rate, i.e. with the decrease in contact time.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">With higher methane conversions rates, allowing more contact time, the CO<sub>2 </sub>yield continues to increase up to 30% methane conversion, falling slightly around 15% yield and significantly when methane conversions reach around 50%. When methane conversion is over 55%, an insignificant yield of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>is found. Thus the lowest yield of CO<sub>2 </sub>is found for methane conversion higher than 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">The CO yield stabilises at around 15% for methane conversions higher than 20%. Water yield stabilises at 5% for methane conversion from 20% up to around 40% increasing to almost 10% water yield at around 50% methane conversion, falling again to around 5% yield at 55% methane conversion. Hydrogen yield rises to around 18% hydrogen for methane conversions from 30% up to 50% declining to 0.16 yield for higher methane conversions.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">Thus the contact time (controlled by the feed rate) does not have a significant influence on the resulting products, but does influence the methane conversion rate. An advantage of certain embodiments of the present invention is that they can be used with low and high flow rates (producing corresponding high and low contact times) without affecting the resulting products. Longer contact times aid methane conversion and provides high yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and low yields of water and carbon dioxide with methane conversion is at about 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0102">To obtain this contact time the total feed flow rate needs to be lower than 185 ml/min for this load of catalyst and temperature of 1023.15K. Other embodiments of the invention can use different feed flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0103">It is well recognised that the partial oxidation of methane may occur via two distinct mechanisms, i.e., direct partial oxidation or total oxidation followed by reforming reactions [3]. In order to elucidate the mechanism for the catalytic membrane reactor used here, the effect of the temperature on the methane conversion and product yields was studied. The results of the analysis are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows the influence of temperature on methane conversion and products yields for a total feed flow rate of 165 ml/min (150 ml/min of methane and 15 ml/min of oxygen). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows that all the oxygen is consumed. This occurs before significant amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed. Another important feature is that the conversion of methane, yield of water and yield of hydrogen all pass through a maximum at 750&#xb0; C. This behaviour suggests that below 750&#xb0; C., water, carbon monoxide and hydrogen are primary products while carbon dioxide is a parallel side reaction as depicted in scheme 1.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0106">Kinetic modelling has shown that the overall reaction can be described well with the contribution of parallel oxidation and full oxidation according to scheme 1.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0107">Above 750&#xb0; C., the total oxidation reaction r<sub>2 </sub>is expected to dominate with a significant increase in water and carbon dioxide. However, examination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows that the carbon dioxide yield shows only a modest increase above 750&#xb0; C., while the yields for water and hydrogen fall above this temperature. This suggests that hydrogen, carbon dioxide and water are being consumed accordingly to scheme 2 below.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0109">Scheme 2 helps explain the fall in the water and hydrogen yields, the modest CO<sub>2 </sub>yield increase and the fall in methane conversion above 750&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0110">One important aspect in the subsequent conversion of synthesis gas to liquids via a Fischer-Tropsch type reaction is the hydrogen: carbon monoxide ratio. A ratio of 2/1 is optimum for this conversion. From examination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> it can be seen that an optimal temperature of around 750&#xb0; C. results in the desired syngas (H2/CO) ratio of 2.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0111">The optimal feed ratio of methane to oxygen is shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to be 10, although reasonable results which are relatively close to the desired ratio of 2 are obtained at feed ratios of between 2 and 6 also.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a plot of the H<sub>2</sub>/CO over the temperature range studied. The optimum for gas-to-liquids conversion is obtained at a temperature of 750&#xb0; C. Above this temperature, a ratio below 2.0 is attained while below 750&#xb0; C., a value above 2.0 is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0113">Selectivity is defined as the yield of a particular component in proportion to the amount of methane conversion, that is
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Selectivity<sub>X</sub>=Yield<sub>X</sub>/Conversion<sub>CH4 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0114">Selectivity for low and high methane conversion rates is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. There the CO selectivity remains almost constant with values around 0.9. This possibly indicates the absence of secondary reactions for CO in low methane conversions. Hydrogen selectivity decreases for methane conversion up to 15% and increases thereafter, reaching similar CO selectivity values.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0115">Water selectivity profile follows a mirror image of hydrogen selectivity, increasing for conversions up to 15%, decreasing for higher conversions. For higher values of methane conversion water selectivity is constant, indicating the absence of secondary reactions for water formation.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0116">Hydrogen selectivity decreases significantly for methane conversions up to 50%, increasing slightly after that.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0117">The selectivity of Co decreases to lower values than H<sub>2 </sub>selectivity for methane conversions up to 45% becoming stable thereafter, indicating that for methane conversions higher than 46%, CO is not formed by any secondary reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0118">CO<sub>2 </sub>selectivity decreases with the increase of methane conversion, being the least selective gas formed in this reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0119">It is important to note that the above-mentioned experimental data were taken with varying contact time, which can influence on the selectivity values. For constant contact time, but varying temperature, values are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0120">Effect of Feed Composition Variation on Reactor Performance</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> show the yield and selectivity when a varying proportion of nitrogen is added to the oxygen feed. This influences the contact time of the reagents with the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that CO yield falls constantly with the addition of nitrogen in the system. Hydrogen yield decreases with up to 50% nitrogen in the oxygen feed and is constant thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">The selectivity of carbon dioxide and water as shown in the yield chart is not affected by the addition of nitrogen in the system. However carbon monoxide and hydrogen selectivities have a continuous drop after a pick up at around 50% vol. of nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0124">The water and CO<sub>2 </sub>yields values do not differ significantly when nitrogen is present or absent although there is a small rise for air composition (80% N<sub>2</sub>)</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also shows that even for an 80% vol N<sub>2 </sub>feed (and hence 20% O<sub>2 </sub>feed) total oxygen conversion takes place at a temperature of 750&#xb0; C. The results show that embodiments of the present invention can work by using an air feed rather than a pure oxygen feed thereby negating the need for an oxygen separation plant for this reaction to take place. This clearly reduces both the initial outlays and operating costs of performing the reaction. Thus a benefit of certain embodiments of the invention is that air separation is not required to produce the syngas of optimal ratio for onward reaction to liquid hydrocarbons via a Fischer-Tropsch reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0126">In contrast to the nitrogen, the addition of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the feed does not influence CO yield, but reduces hydrogen yield whilst increasing H<sub>2</sub>O yield. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0127">The selectivity of CO and H<sub>2 </sub>decreases slightly in higher proportion for hydrogen with the addition of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the methane feed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0128">The water selectivity is generally constant but does increase slightly for higher amounts of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the feed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0129">An advantage of certain embodiments of the invention is that the oxygen and methane are fed separately into the apparatus and so there is no danger of an explosion. The oxygen proceeds through the modified membrane <b>10</b>, is activated and then reacts when it comes into contact with the methane. Thus it is possible to lower the ratio of methane and oxygen in the feed to a ratio more suitable for their reaction. Such a ratio would normally be considered potentially explosive, but certain embodiments of the present invention allow for such ratios without the potential for an explosion partly because of the separate oxygen/methane feed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0130">Embodiments of the present invention benefit from the highly dispersed catalyst which increase its surface area and efficacy of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0131">Embodiments of the present invention benefit from the high conversion rate of oxygen. To illustrate the benefits of membrane reactor operation in syngas production, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>shows the effect of reaction temperature on the conversion of methane over Ir-loaded catalyst carried out with fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor (350-10 mm) at atmospheric pressure, using 60 mg of catalyst, 25 ml/min of O<sub>2 </sub>and temperature range of 673-873K. At 873K the performance of Ir and Rh are roughly identical [4].</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0132">In the same figure, experimental data is shown for a membrane system in accordance with the present invention at 900.15K. The conversion values obtained using a fixed-bed flow reactor are significantly lower than those obtained in the membrane reactor due to equilibrium limitation. This has been overcome in the membrane reactor which achieves 100% conversion of oxygen and a methane conversion of 41%.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0133">Since, in the modified membrane <b>10</b>, the catalysts <b>12</b> are highly dispersed, lower reaction temperatures are feasible thereby reducing the propensity for coke formation and subsequent deactivation of the catalysts <b>12</b>. The absence of coke formation optimises catalyst usage whilst maintaining high syngas selectivity. In the operation of the membrane apparatus <b>8</b>, additional catalysts (not shown) may be inserted into the inner bore of the modified membrane <b>10</b> as necessary to further enhance the reaction. These additional catalysts (not shown) are obtained by physically breaking another sample of a modified membrane <b>10</b> into appropriate particle sizes and inserting the particle sizes into the test or operation sample.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0134">Certain embodiments of the present invention benefit from being used to generate hydrogen from, for example, methane. The hydrogen can be used as a fuel itself rather than converted into larger hydrocarbons via a Fischer-Tropsch reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0135">Certain embodiments of the invention benefit from the fact that the partial oxidation method is exothermic and therefore reduces energy consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0136">Certain embodiments of the invention benefit from the fact that the process has a fast start-up.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0137">In contrast, steam reforming to produce syngas has a large endothermic reaction and a slow start-up time. Thus certain embodiments of the invention provide a catalytic membrane reactor which has been developed and used to produce hydrogen, particularly synthesis gas, under various operating conditions with total consumption of oxygen. At lower feed ratios (CH<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>), the syngas ratio is well above 2.0 while at higher CH<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>ratio, the syngas ratio is 2.0. Thus depending on the application the reactor is flexible to the extent that it could be applied in the Fischer-Tropsch process for converting natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons. For gas-to-liquids conversion, an optimum temperature of 750&#xb0; C. has been established at which the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio is 2.0.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0138">Modifications and improvements may be made to the foregoing without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example;</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0139">Though the apparatus and method described relates to the production of syngas from the reaction between methane and oxygen, a similar method and apparatus could be used in the reaction of any light hydrocarbon such as members of the alkane or alkene group. Furthermore, the process and apparatus could be used in any reaction where there are two reactants which have constraints that make it undesirable to mix them before the reaction has taken place, such as flammability constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0140">It will be understood that the flux of oxygen could be reversed by feeding the oxygen into the bore of the modified membrane <b>10</b>, and the methane into the outer bore <b>22</b>. However, in this case this arrangement would be less desirable since the methane may have impurities in it, such as H<sub>2</sub>S, which would poison the catalyst <b>12</b>. Therefore passing the oxygen through the modified membrane <b>10</b> is preferred.</p>
