<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a chromatography kit, an examination container used for the chromatography, and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a method to which an chromatographic technique is applied as a manner for assaying simply a variety of diseases by using a body fluid such as blood, blood serum, a laryngeal wiped fluid, a nasal cavity wiped fluid, a nasal discharge, and urine as the specimen material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The chromatography may be conducted by applying an immunochromatography kit composed of an immunochromatography examination strip for assaying an analyte (pathogenic virus) in a sample, and an examination container which can contain the sample. The examination strip is provided with a sample addition part immersed in the sample, a label holding part for holding a label material for causing an antigen-antibody reaction with respect to the material to be detected in the sample, and a judgment part to which an immobilization material causing an antigen-antibody reaction with respect to the material to be detected is immobilized, these parts being usually disposed on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional immunochromatography kit is used commonly in accordance with such a manner that a sample is transferred to an examination container, an examination strip is further inserted in the examination container, thereafter the examination container is disposed in an examination container holder such as a container casing placed on a desk, they are allowed to stand for about 20 minutes, and then, the examination container is taken out from the examination container holder to confirm the presence of lines exhibiting the presence of the material to be detected. During the assay, the sample flows through the sample addition part, the label holding part, and the judgment part in the examination strip.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the substrate of the examination strip inserted in the examination container adheres to the inner wall of the examination container, there is such a case where the sample flows through a gap between the substrate and the examination container due to a capillary phenomenon. As a result, there is a case where an amount of the sample flowing through the sample addition part, the label holding part, and the judgment part decreases, whereby an adequate assay cannot be made. On one hand, when a plane on which the judgment part and the like have been formed adheres on the inner wall of the examination container, there is a case where the assay accuracy decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, there is a case where the examination container is inclined or turned over carelessly in case of placing the examination container in the examination container holder, or confirming the presence of the lines. As a consequence, there is a case where the sample in the examination container is flown off, so that the assay result cannot be obtained. In such a case, a body fluid must be collected again from the person being examined; and the reexamination must be conducted. Besides, when such sample is leaked out from the examination container, there is a possibility of the contact between the sample and the assayer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims, and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a chromatography kit which can prevent from adherence of an examination strip on the inner wall of an examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further object of the present invention is to provide a chromatography kit including an examination container which can prevent from leaking out of the sample contained therein in even a case when the examination container is inclined or turned over.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The chromatography kit of the present invention is provided with an examination container one end of which has an inlet for receiving a sample, and an chromatography examination strip used by inserting from the inlet into the examination container wherein the examination strip includes a sample addition part to be immersed in the sample contained in the examination container, a label holding part for holding a label material causing a reaction with respect to an analyte in the sample, and a judgment part to which an immobilization material causing a reaction with respect to the material to be detected is immobilized; and the examination container includes a prevention part from adherence on an inner wall functioning to prevent from adherence of the examination strip on the inner wall of the examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the examination container in the kit of the invention is provided with the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall functioning to prevent from adherence of a member on the inner wall of the examination container, it is possible to prevent from flowing a sample through a gap between a substrate and the examination container due to a capillary phenomenon when an assay is conducted by applying the kit, whereby appropriate and highly accurate assay can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The prevention part from adherence on an inner wall to be mounted on the examination container of the present invention is preferably arranged in such that it is disposed on the inner wall or the inlet of the examination container, and it has an oblique plane which comes away from the inner wall of the examination container in the direction of the bottom thereof, whereby a liquid reservoir is formed between the oblique plane and the inner wall of the examination container; the liquid reservoir functioning to retain the sample in case of turning over the examination container. As a result, it is possible to prevent from leaking out of the sample contained in an examination container outside the examination container in even a case when it is erroneously inclined or turned over during conducting an assay by applying the kit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The prevention part from adherence on an inner wall to be mounted on the examination container of the present invention involves preferably an elongated opening or groove into which the examination strip is to be inserted; and the elongated opening or groove is constituted so as to have such a rotatable range that the examination strip can rotate within a range of &#xb1;45&#xb0; or less, when the examination strip is inserted into the elongated opening or groove. According to the constitution, a freely rotatable range for the examination strip is restricted, so that the orientation of the examination strip is determined at a certain degree. Thus, it becomes possible that an operator observes the assay results from a specified direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the following, embodiments of especially an immunochromatography kit regarding the present invention will be described by referring to the accompanying drawings, but it is to be noted that the drawings are used for the explanatory convenience of the invention, and accordingly, the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The immunochromatography kit being an embodiment of the present invention is provided with an examination container one end of which has an inlet for receiving a sample, and an immunochromatography examination strip used by inserting from the inlet into the examination container wherein the examination strip includes a sample addition part to be immersed in the sample contained in the examination container, a label holding part for holding a label material causing an antigen-antibody reaction with respect to an analyte in the sample, and a judgment part to which an immobilization material causing an antigen-antibody reaction with respect to the material to be detected is immobilized; and the examination container includes a prevention part from adherence on an inner wall functioning to prevent from adherence of the examination strip on the inner wall of the examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is sufficient that the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall may have a function to prevent from adherence of the examination strip on the inner wall of the examination container (more specifically, it is sufficient that the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall has such function that at least a part of the examination strip does not adhere on the inner wall of the examination container, when the examination strip is immersed into a sample contained in the examination container), and accordingly, a variety of manners of practice may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Under the circumstances, the invention will be described with reference to the following specific manners of practice. Namely, they are (1) the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall comprises a member having a smaller throughhole in the opening section than the inlet of the examination container; (2) the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall is a guidance part for guiding a sample addition part of the examination strip to the central part in the bottom of the examination container; and (3) the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall is a projection provided on the inner wall of the examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the following, a variety of manners of practice of the examination container will be described first, and a variety of manners of practice of the examination strip will be described finally.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">1. A Manner of Practice wherein the Prevention Part from Adherence on an Inner Wall Comprises a Member Having a Smaller Throughhole in the Opening Section than the Inlet of the Examination Container</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing a construction of the immunochromatography kit according to an embodiment wherein the prevention part from adherence on an inner wall comprises the member having a smaller throughhole in the opening section than the inlet of the examination container. The kit is provided with an immunochromatography examination strip <b>1</b> for assaying an analyte in a sample, and an examination container <b>3</b> capable of containing the sample. The examination container <b>3</b> has an inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>for receiving the sample at one end thereof and a prevention part from adherence on an inner wall (hereinafter optionally referred simply to as &#x201c;prevention part&#x201d;) <b>15</b> for preventing adherence of an examination strip <b>1</b> on an inner wall of the examination container <b>3</b>. The examination strip <b>1</b> is applied by inserting it into the examination container <b>3</b> through the inlet <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall comprises a member having a smaller throughhole in the opening section than the inlet of the examination container <b>3</b>. For the convenience of illustration, the figure of the examination container <b>3</b> is the one viewed from the slightly upper direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present manner of practice, since the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall comprises a member having a smaller throughhole in the opening section than the inlet of the examination container <b>3</b>, it is possible to prevent from jumping the sample which has been poured into the examination container <b>3</b> to the outside in case of turning out of the examination container <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall of the present manner of practice has a function for preventing from leaking-out of the sample. The prevention part <b>15</b> is placed at a position under that of a judgment part at the time when the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted in the examination container <b>3</b> (i.e. a first judgment part <b>11</b>A). In this case, the sample is not in contact with the judgment part even if the examination container <b>3</b> is turned over. Accordingly, the examination container <b>3</b> may be returned to the initial position and the assay may be restarted. It is preferred that the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is placed at a position under that of a label holding part (i.e. a label holding member <b>9</b>) at the time when the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted in the examination container <b>3</b>. In this case, it is possible to prevent from dissolving out the label material maintained in the label holding part into the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>) are enlarged views wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is a perspective view showing the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) is a top view showing the prevention part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) viewed from the immediately above direction thereof, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) is a sectional view taken along the line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) in which the inside wall <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the examination container <b>3</b> is also indicated by a dotted line according to need.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall comprises a ring-shaped member inserted into the examination container <b>3</b>. The ring-shaped member is made from a resin and the like, and has a certain degree of elasticity, so that it is held at a desired position by means of elastic force. The ring-shaped member may be adhesive bonded to a desired position by means of an adhesive. In place of the ring-shaped member, a member having a shape of the prevention part in which a part of a ring is cut off (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)), or another member having a shape of the prevention part in which a part of another ring is overlapped on another part thereof (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>)) may also be applied. The members having the shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) are hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;quasi-ring shaped member&#x201d;. Since the quasi-ring shaped member has a comparatively changeable diameter, it is easily inserted into the examination container <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall has a throughhole <b>17</b> wherein the throughhole <b>17</b> is provided with a first opening <b>17</b><i>a </i>on the side of an inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>and a second opening <b>17</b><i>b </i>on the side of a bottom <b>3</b><i>b</i>. In the present specification, when the term &#x201c;opening&#x201d; is simply used, it is directed to the smaller one in the first and the second openings <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second opening <b>17</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the first opening <b>17</b><i>a</i>. The first opening <b>17</b><i>a </i>has substantially the same size as that of the inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>, while the second opening <b>17</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the examination container. Accordingly, the throughhole <b>17</b> is tapered off in the direction of the bottom <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>. A side <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the throughhole <b>17</b> forms a slope opened outwardly. The prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall forms a truncated cone tapering off in the direction of the bottom <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>3</b> (more specifically, it forms a circular truncated cone). A side <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is substantially parallel to the side <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the throughhole <b>17</b>. In this case, a liquid reservoir portion <b>19</b> for retaining a fluid sample in case of turning over the examination container <b>3</b> is formed between the side <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall and the inside wall <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>. Hence, it becomes difficult to further leak out the sample outside the examination container in case of turning over the examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a manner for applying an immunochromatography kit of the present embodiment will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), a specimen material such as a nasal cavity suction fluid of a patient collected by the use of a cotton bud <b>21</b> is diluted into a developing solvent <b>23</b> contained in a specimen material dilution container <b>22</b> to prepare an assay sample <b>24</b>. Then, a sample transfer pipette <b>27</b> is fitted to the specimen material dilution container <b>22</b>. The sample transfer pipette <b>27</b> has a transfer portion <b>27</b><i>a </i>the sectional contour of which is a substantially circle. However, the sectional contour of the transfer portion <b>27</b><i>a </i>may have the other contours such as elliptical, quadrangular, and the like shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>), the transfer portion <b>27</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the examination container <b>3</b>, and the side of the specimen material dilution container <b>22</b> is pushed, whereby a predetermined amount of the sample <b>24</b> is transferred into the examination container <b>3</b>. Since the throughhole <b>17</b> in the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is tapered off in the direction of the bottom <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>, the sample <b>24</b> is guided to the bottom <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>3</b> even when the sample <b>24</b> is adhered to the side <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the throughhole <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>), the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted into the examination container <b>3</b>. Since the side <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the throughhole <b>17</b> expands in the direction of the inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>, the examination strip <b>1</b> can be comparatively easily inserted into the examination container <b>3</b>. In this condition, when the examination strip <b>1</b> and the examination container <b>3</b> are allowed to stand for around 10 to 20 minutes, the sample <b>24</b> transfers sequentially to a sample addition member <b>7</b>, a label holding member <b>9</b>, a chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and an absorption member <b>13</b> due to a capillary phenomenon. In the case when the sample <b>24</b> passes through the label holding member <b>9</b>, label materials maintained in the label holding member <b>9</b> (a first, a second, and a control label materials) are dissolved out into the developing solvent. When Flu A virus or Flu B virus is contained in the sample, a blue line <b>29</b><i>a </i>appears in a first judgment part <b>11</b>A or a second judgment part <b>11</b>B due to the above-mentioned action. Furthermore, a red line <b>29</b><i>b </i>appears on a control part <b>11</b>C irrespective of the presence of a virus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) shows a case wherein Flu A virus is contained in the specimen material.)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the following, a variety of embodiments of the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall or the examination container <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(1) A Columnar Prevention Part from Adherence on an Inner Wall.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The columnar prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>) wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>) correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The profile of the throughhole <b>17</b> in the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>), but the outline is in a columnar profile wherein the side <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is in parallel to the long axial direction of the examination container <b>3</b> (the direction in the direction of the inlet <b>3</b><i>a </i>from the bottom <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>3</b>), so that the contact area of the side <b>15</b><i>a </i>with the inside wall <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the examination container <b>3</b> becomes wider. As a result, the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall of the present embodiment is held stably in the examination container <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">(2) A Prevention Part from Adherence on an Inner Wall, which has an Elongated Opening.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall, which has an elongated second opening <b>17</b><i>b</i>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>) wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>) correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second opening <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the throughhole <b>17</b> in the prevention part <b>15</b> from adherence on an inner wall is formed in an elongated profile (more specifically, a rectangle), but the second opening <b>17</b><i>b </i>may have an elliptical or the like profile.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted into the second opening <b>17</b><i>b</i>, the examination strip <b>1</b> cannot freely rotate in this condition, so that the rotationally movable range is &#xb1;45&#xb0; or less. The symbol &#x201c;&#xb1;&#x201d; means both the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction. In this respect, for example, the expression &#x201c;&#xb1;45&#xb0; or less&#x201d; means that a rotationally movable range in the clockwise direction is in 45&#xb0; or less, while the rotationally movable range in the counterclockwise is in 45&#xb0; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present embodiment is advantageous in the case where a plurality of the examination containers <b>3</b> are aligned in, for example, a rack to assay specimen materials, and the results are confirmed from a certain direction. When the examination strip <b>1</b> is freely rotatable, there is such a case where the results cannot be confirmed from the front, because a plane having the judgment part directs transverse or backward directions. In the present embodiment, however, since the rotation angle of the examination strip <b>1</b> is in &#xb1;45&#xb0; or less, the assay results can be confirmed from the front thereof so far as the direction of the examination container <b>3</b> is appropriately arranged by inserting the examination strip <b>1</b> into the examination container <b>3</b> having the judgment part in such that the plane thereof is directed to the front thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">From the reason as mentioned above, it is desirable that the range wherein the examination strip <b>1</b> can rotate has a smaller range, and preferably it is &#xb1;30&#xb0; or less.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, a plurality of the examination containers <b>40</b> is aligned in a rack or the like. In this case, the examination containers <b>40</b> are positioned so as to direct each of the slits <b>41</b><i>b </i>thereof to the same direction to each other. Then, a predetermined amount of a sample <b>24</b> prepared by diluting a nasal cavity suction fluid of a patient into a developing solvent is transferred in the examination container <b>40</b>. Thereafter, the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted into the examination container <b>40</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Under the condition, when the examination container <b>40</b> and the examination strip <b>1</b> are allowed to stand for around 10 to 20 minutes, the sample <b>24</b> transfers sequentially from the sample addition member <b>7</b> to the label holding member <b>9</b>, the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and the absorption member <b>13</b> due to a capillary phenomenon. In the case when the sample <b>24</b> passes through the label holding member <b>9</b>, label materials maintained in the label holding member <b>9</b> (a first, a second, and a control label materials) are dissolved out into the developing solvent. When Flu A virus or Flu B virus is contained in the sample, a blue line <b>29</b><i>a </i>appears in a first judgment part <b>11</b>A or a second judgment part <b>11</b>B due to the above-mentioned action. Furthermore, a red line <b>29</b><i>b </i>appears on a control part <b>11</b>C irrespective of the presence of a virus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a case wherein Flu A virus is contained in the specimen material.) For reference, a schematic diagram indicating the vicinities of the lines <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>viewed from the direction of the arrow X is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the kit of the present embodiment is applied, the sample addition member <b>7</b> of the examination strip <b>1</b> is contained in the slit <b>41</b><i>b</i>.

As mentioned herein, the direction of the examination strip <b>1</b> is determined by the slit <b>41</b><i>b </i>at a certain degree. Accordingly, when the directions of the slits <b>41</b><i>b </i>are aligned in case of setting up examination containers <b>40</b> in a rack, the directions of the examination strips <b>1</b> inserted in the respective examination containers <b>40</b> can be aligned.

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, one example of a method for applying the kit of the present embodiment will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">First, a predetermined amount of a sample <b>24</b> prepared by diluting a nasal cavity suction fluid of a patient into a developing solvent is transferred in the examination container <b>43</b>. Then, the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted into the examination container <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Under the condition, when the examination container <b>40</b> and the examination strip <b>1</b> are allowed to stand for around 10 to 20 minutes, the sample <b>24</b> transfers sequentially from the sample addition member <b>7</b> to the label holding member <b>9</b>, the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and the absorption member <b>13</b> due to a capillary phenomenon and the sample is examined.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">There is a possibility of appearance of such a problem that assay precision decreases and the like, when the front or the back of the examination strip <b>1</b> adheres on the inner wall <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>43</b>. In the present manner of practice, however, since the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherence on an inner wall is provided on the inner wall <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>43</b>, the substrate <b>5</b> of the examination strip <b>1</b> does not adhere on the inner wall <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the examination container <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, and thus, there is no problem as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although the invention has been described so far with taking the specified manners of practice as examples, the present invention is not limited to the manners of practice, but a variety of modifications is applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">An outline of the examination container <b>43</b> is not limited to a rectangular prismatic shape, but it may be the other shapes, for example, it may be a tetragonal prismatic shape. In this case, there is such a possibility that the front or the back of the examination strip <b>1</b> comes to be in contact with all the four inner walls of the examination container <b>43</b>, so that it is preferred to provide the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherence on an inner wall on each of the four inner walls. The prevention part <b>45</b> may be provided on all the inner walls where the front or the back of the examination strip <b>1</b> comes to be in contact with the examiner container <b>43</b>. However, the prevention part <b>45</b> may be provided on only the inner wall of the examination strip <b>1</b> with which there is such a possibility that the front of the examination strip <b>1</b> comes to be in contact, or only the inner wall of the examination strip <b>1</b> with which there is such a possibility that the back of the examination strip <b>1</b> comes to be in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The number of the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherent on an inner wall is not specifically restricted, but it may be only one, or two or more. The position at which the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherent on an inner wall is to be disposed is not limited, for instance, it may be a position near to the bottom of the examination container <b>43</b>, or that near to the inlet of the examination container <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A shape of the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherence on an inner wall is not specifically restricted, but it may be any of a hemispherical, columnar, polyhedron prismatic, polyhedral, and the like shapes wherein the extreme end of the prevention part <b>45</b> from adherence on an inner wall may be sharpened or rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">4. Explanation of an Examination Strip.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>) are a side view and a front view showing the examination strip <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>14</b> and <b>20</b> wherein the examination strip <b>1</b> comprises a substrate <b>5</b> made of a plastic sheet having an adhesive layer on the surface thereof on which a sample addition member <b>7</b> made of a rayon non-woven fabric, a label holding member <b>9</b> made of a glass fiber non-woven fabric, a chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> made of a nitrocellulose porous member, and an absorption member <b>13</b> made of a cellulose non-woven fabric are provided. The sample addition member <b>7</b> functions as a sample addition part to be immersed in a sample contained in the examination container <b>3</b>. The label holding member <b>9</b> is disposed in contact with the sample addition member <b>7</b> and functions as a label holding part for holding a label material causing an antigen-antibody reaction with an analyte in the sample. The chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> is disposed in contact with the label holding member <b>9</b> and has a judgment part to which an immobilization material causing an antigen-antibody reaction with respect to the material to be detected is immobilized. The absorption member <b>13</b> is disposed so as to be in contact with the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">On the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, a line-like first judgment part <b>11</b>A, a second judgment part <b>11</b>B, and a control part <b>11</b>C are formed in this order from the upstream side thereof. In the label holding member <b>9</b>, the first label material, the second label material, and the control label material are maintained. In the first judgment part <b>11</b>A, the second judgment part <b>11</b>B, and the control part <b>11</b>C, anti-influenza A antibody and anti-influenza B antibody (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;anti Flu A antibody&#x201d; and &#x201c;anti Flu B antibody&#x201d;, respectively), and biotin are immobilized, respectively, as an immobilization material. Furthermore, indications &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;!&#x201d; indicating the classifications thereof, respectively, are printed at the positions corresponding to the first judgment part <b>11</b>A, the second judgment part <b>11</b>B, and the control part <b>11</b>C, respectively. The first label material and the second label material are the anti Flu A antibody and the anti Flu B antibody labeled with blue latex particles, respectively. The control label material is avidin labeled with red latex particles. The anti Flu A antibody and the anti Flu B antibody are combined with influenza A type virus which is a first material to be detected and influenza B type virus which is a second material to be detected (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Flu A virus&#x201d; and &#x201c;Flu B virus&#x201d;, respectively) through an antigen-antibody reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Taking Flu A virus as an example, the anti Flu A antibody labeled and existing in the label holding member <b>9</b> recognizes a predetermined site of the Flu A virus to form a compound material as a result of the combination through an antigen-antibody reaction, when the Flu A virus is contained in a sample. Then, the anti Flu A antibody existing in the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> recognizes the other site of the Flu A virus to capture the compound material. When the compound material is captured, a blue line appears on the first judgment part <b>11</b>A, whereby the Flu A virus is detected by visual observation.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, although avidin is not captured by the anti Flu A antibody and the anti Flu B antibody existing in the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, it is captured by the biotin immobilized in the control part <b>11</b>C, because it combines specifically with biotin. When the avidin is captured, a red line appears on the control part <b>11</b>C, whereby it is visually observed that the avidin reaches the control part <b>11</b>C. Since the control part <b>11</b>C is positioned on the downstream side of the first judgment part <b>11</b>A and the second judgment part <b>11</b>B, when the red line is confirmed, it is confirmed that the sample passes through the first judgment part <b>11</b>A and the second judgment part <b>11</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, a variety of embodiments of the examination strips <b>1</b> will be described. The examination strip <b>1</b> may be those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>24</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>24</b>(<i>c</i>) other than that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>23</b>(<i>b</i>). In the examination strip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>a</i>), the strip is constituted in such that a sample addition member <b>7</b> covers a label holding member <b>9</b> to be contact with the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>. In the examination strip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>b</i>), it is constituted in such that the label holding member <b>9</b> is disposed so as to keep a gap with respect to the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and the sample addition member <b>7</b> covers the label holding member <b>9</b> so as to be in contact with the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>. In the examination strip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>c</i>), it is constituted in such that the label holding member <b>9</b> is disposed so as to keep a gap with respect to the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and a developing member <b>47</b> is disposed so as to be in contact with the label holding member <b>9</b> and the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>. The developing member <b>47</b> may be prepared by a non-woven fabric made from a variety of raw materials such as rayon, glass fiber, cellulose fibers and the like as in the case of the sample addition member <b>7</b>. According to the constitutions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>24</b>(<i>c</i>), since a member which exhibits a rapid developing rate of a sample is sandwiched between the label holding member <b>9</b> and the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, a rate of dissolving out the label material in the label holding member <b>9</b> becomes fast, so that a rapid measurement becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Although the invention has been described so far with taking the specified manners of practice as examples, the present invention is not limited to the manners of practice, but a variety of modifications is applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The prevention part from adherence on an inner wall in the present invention means a mechanism for preventing from adherence of the examination strip on the inner wall of the examination container. Particularly, it is preferred that the prevention part from adherence on the inner wall is located so as to form a space by which the judgment part of the examination strip does not adhere on the inner wall of the examination container, when the examination strip is inserted into the examination container. Besides, when the prevention part from adherence on the inner wall is provided with a liquid reservoir for retaining a fluid sample at the time of turning over the examination container, it is possible to prevent from leaking out of the sample outside the examination container.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An analyte which is applied in the present invention is not specifically restricted so far as a material is the one which causes an antigen-antibody reaction. An example of such materials as described above includes cells of bacteria, protist, fungi and the like; viruses, proteins, polysaccharides and the like. For instance, there are parainfluenza viruses, RS viruses, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency viruses, hepatitis viruses, disease viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome other than the above-described influenza viruses; <i>Bacillus coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus piyogenes</i>; malaria parasite, and the other causal organisms of various diseases such as alimentary diseases, central nervous system diseases, and hemorrhagic fever; the metabolic products thereof; carcinoembryonic antigens; tumor markers such as Cyfra; hormones and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The substrate <b>5</b> is a material for disposing appropriately the above-described members such as the sample addition member <b>7</b>, and label holding member <b>9</b>; and it may be prepared from a variety of materials such as papers, and glass in addition to plastics. Furthermore, the sample addition member <b>7</b> may be prepared from a variety of raw materials such as glass fibers, and cellulose fibers in addition to rayon. The label holding member <b>9</b> may be prepared from a variety of materials such as cellulose fibers in addition to glass fibers. The chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> may be prepared from a variety of materials such as nylon (for example, a modified nylon into which an amino group that may have a carboxyl group or an alkyl group as a substituent is introduced), polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF), and cellulose acetates in addition to nitrocellulose. The absorption member <b>13</b> may be prepared from a variety of materials such as glass fibers in addition to celluloses. For the sample addition member <b>7</b>, the label holding member <b>9</b>, the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, and the absorption member <b>13</b>, materials each having a variety of structures wherein a sample can be developed due to a capillary phenomenon may be applied in addition to non-woven fabrics and porous materials.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> may be provided with either one judgment part, or two or more judgment parts in response to types of materials to be detected. Further, the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b> may be provided with no control part. In this connection, the judgment parts and the control part may not be in a line-like shape, but they may be formed into, for example, a circular, a square or the like shape. The label holding member <b>9</b> may maintain only one label material or two or more label materials. Furthermore, the label holding material <b>9</b> may be provided with no control label material. The label material is labeled with latex particles with a color other than blue and red; a metal colloid of gold or the like; or dye/pigment molecules and the like. In the case where there are two or more types of label materials, each label material may be labeled in different colors from one another, or in the same color. Moreover, the label materials and the control label materials may be labeled in different colors from one another, or in the same color.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the above-described embodiments, although the classification indications of the first judgment part <b>11</b>A, the second judgment part <b>11</b>B, and the control part <b>11</b>C are printed on the chromatography membrane support <b>11</b>, these classification indications may be applied by a manner other than the printing, or may not be applied. The above-described classification indications may be applied on the examination container <b>3</b> at the positions corresponding to the first judgment part <b>11</b>A, the second judgment part <b>11</b>B, and the control part <b>11</b>C, when the examination strip <b>1</b> is inserted in the examination container <b>3</b>. In addition, the classification indications may be applied with the symbols other than that of &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;!&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">For the immobilization materials and the label materials, a variety of antibodies and antigens may be applied. Namely, in the case where an analyte is an antigen, an antibody which causes an antigen-antibody reaction with the antigen may be used as the immobilization material and the label materials, while in the case where an analyte is an antibody, an antigen which causes an antigen-antibody reaction with the antibody or the antibody being the material to be detected which causes an antigen-antibody reaction with the antibody may be used as the immobilization material and the label materials.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The immobilization material of the control part may be avidin, and the control label material may be biotin. Moreover, the immobilization material of the control part and the control label material are those of materials other than that of a combination of biotin and avidin. For instance, it may be a combination of materials combined through an antigen-antibody reaction. For example, an antigen is used as the control label material, while an antibody which causes an antigen-antibody reaction with the antigen as an immobilization material of the control part is used; and vice versa. For the control label material, those which cause no antigen-antibody reaction with an analyte or an immobilization material in the judgment part are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A variety of characteristics described in the above manners of practice may be combined with each other. In the case where a plurality of characteristics is contained in a manner of practice, one or plural characteristics thereof may be appropriately taken out, and they may be used alone or in combination thereof in order to apply them for the kit according to the present invention.</p>
