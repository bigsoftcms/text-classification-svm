<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention provides a novel in vitro method for identifying HIV-1 protease inhibitors with reduced potential for inducing metabolic abnormalities. The invention further provides diagnostic methods for identifying patients who may be at risk of developing metabolic abnormalities subsequent to the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The invention also provides novel polynucleotides associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor induced metabolic abnormalities.

The invention further relates to diagnostic methods for using these novel polynucleotides in the diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention of HIV-1 protease inhibitor induced metabolic abnormalities.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) involves the use of a combination of three different classes of antiviral compounds for the treatment of HIV infection. These compounds include the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">HAART has improved the outcomes in HIV-1 infected patients, however, its use is complicated by metabolic adverse events that are collectively termed HAART-associated lipodystrophy Carr, A., Aids, 17 Suppl 1: p. S141-8 (2003). These metabolic changes include fat atrophy/hypertrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Although the mechanistic basis underlying lipodystrophy associated with HAART is poorly understood, the associated metabolic abnormalities are well established cardiovascular risk factors (Grinspoon, S. et al., N Engl J Med, 352(1):48-62 (2005)).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Genetic association studies performed by the inventors revealed that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the resistin gene provided evidence of an association with a risk of developing lipodystrophy in patients enrolled on HAART. Resistin was originally cloned as an adipocytokine that provides a mechanistic link between obesity and insulin resistance (Steppan, C. M., et al., Nature, 409(6818):307-12 (2001)). In mice, hyperresistinemia results in insulin resistance (Rajala, M. W., et al., J Clin Invest, 111(2):225-30 (2003)) and knockout studies have shown that resistin deficient mice are protected from insulin resistance (Banerjee, R. R., et al., Science, 303(5661):1195-8 (2004)). In humans, resistin has been shown to be associated with components of lipodystrophy syndrome in some (Conneely, K. N., et al., Diabetologia, 47(10): 1782-8 (2004), Mattevi, V. S., et al., Hum Genet, 115(3):208-12 (2004)), but not all studies (Ochi, M., et al., Diabetes Res Clin Pract, 61(3): p. 191-8 (2003)).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspartyl proteases comprise a group of proteolytic enzymes that share the same catalytic mechanism (Dash, C., et al., Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol, 38(2):89-119 (2003)). Members of this family include HIV-1 protease and at least five human enzymes. In pre-clinical development, the human aspartyl proteases are used to counter-screen HIV-1 protease inhibitors for selectivity toward HIV-1 protease. However, selectivity toward HIV-1 protease can vary widely across HIV-1 protease inhibitors (Ohtaka, H., et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 36(9):1787-99 (2004)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides, for the first time, an in vitro assay for identifying protease inhibitors that either lack or have a lower propensity for causing metabolic abnormalities in patients.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention also provides genetic polymorphisms in the resistin gene which may cause alterations in the function and/or expression of resistin. Such polymorphisms may genetically predispose certain individuals to an increased risk of developing metabolic abnormalities, particularly in response to HIV protease-inhibitor therapy. Genotypes of such polymorphisms may predict each individual's susceptibility to metabolic abnormalities, and thus will be useful in identifying a group of patients that may be subject to modified HAART treatment regimens. Alternatively, the identification of such a group may preclude one or more individuals within said group from being administered HAART therapy.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also relates to a method for screening for HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds with a diminished ability to increase an individuals likelihood of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of the same.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Table I provides a summary of the SNPs of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention relates to a method of screening for HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds with diminished ability to increase an individuals likelihood of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of the same. The present invention is based on the novel discovery that resistin is sensitive to proteolytic degradation by aspartyl proteases cathepsin D and E as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Since cathespin D and E are inhibited by some HIV-1 protease inhibitors, inhibition of cathespin D and E can result in increased levels of resistin and thus result in metabolic abnormalities. The method of the present invention comprises the step of incubating a mixture of resistin and cathepsin D or E with either one or more test drugs, compounds, or therapeutic agents, in addition to a control compound as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; followed by the step of measuring the level of proteolyzed resistin between the test and control samples, and selecting the test compound with a diminished ability to inhibit cathepsin D- or cathepsin E-dependent degradation of resistin relative to a control compound. Such an HIV-1 protease inhibitor compound would be expected to have a diminished ability to cause metabolic abnormalities in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention also relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a specific location, referred to herein as the polymorphic locus, and complements thereof. The nucleic acid molecule, e.g., a gene, which includes the SNP has at least two alleles, referred to herein as the reference allele and the variant allele. The reference allele (prototypical or wild type allele) typically corresponds to the nucleotide sequence of the native form of the nucleic acid molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention pertains to novel polynucleotides of the human resistin gene comprising at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which has been shown to be associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in patients administered HIV-1 protease inhibitors. These resistin SNPs were identified by sequencing the resistin genomic sequence of a large number of individuals that were subjected to HIV-1 protease inhibitor therapy, and comparing the resistin sequences of those individuals who developed HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities to those individuals who did not develop HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities. Each of the novel resistin SNPs were located in non-coding regions of the resistin gene and are thought to affect the expression levels of resistin in those patients containing one or more of these SNPs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present invention also relates to variant alleles of the described gene and to complements of the variant alleles. The variant allele differs from the reference allele by one nucleotide at the polymorphic locus identified in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The invention further relates to fragments of the variant alleles and portions of complements of the variant alleles which comprise the site of the SNP (e.g., polymorphic locus) and are at least 10 nucleotides in length. Fragments can be, for example, about 5-10, about 5-15, about 10-20, about 5-25, about 10-30, about 10-50 or about 10-100 bases long. For example, a portion of a variant allele which is about 10 nucleotides in length comprises at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (the nucleotide which differs from the reference allele at the polymorphic locus) and nine additional nucleotides which flank the site in the variant allele. These additional nucleotides can be on one or both sides of the polymorphism. Polymorphisms which are the subject of this invention are defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, the invention relates to the human resistin gene having a nucleotide sequence according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> (SEQ ID NOs:1 or 2) comprising a single nucleotide polymorphism at a polymorphic locus at nucleotide 1398 of SEQ ID NOs:1 or 2. The reference nucleotide for the polymorphic locus at nucleotide 1398 is &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The variant nucleotide for the polymorphic locus at nucleotide 1398 is &#x201c;T&#x201d;. The nucleotide sequences of the present invention can be double- or single-stranded.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention further relates to a portion of the human resistin gene comprising one or more polymorphic loci selected from the group consisting of: nucleotide 1398 of SEQ ID NOs:1 or 2.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The single nucleotide polymorphisms described herein derive from the resistin gene that have been shown to be associated, for the first time, with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities or related disorders. Specifically, the reference single nucleotide polymorphisms of the human resistin gene described herein have been demonstrated to statistically increase an individuals susceptibility to developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of an increased dose of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The human resistin gene was chosen as a candidate gene to investigate the potential of it comprising one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype, and in particular, the potential of identifying a resistin SNP associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype upon the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, based upon the association of resistin in glucose metabolism, obesity and insulin resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The invention further provides allele-specific oligonucleotides that hybridize to the human resistin gene, or fragments or complements thereof, comprising one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or polymorphic locus. Such oligonucleotides are expected to hybridize to one polymorphic allele of the nucleic acid molecules described herein but not to the other polymorphic allele(s) of the sequence. Thus, such oligonucleotides can be used to determine the presence or absence of particular alleles of the polymorphic sequences described herein and to distinguish between reference and variant allele for each form. These oligonucleotides can be probes or primers.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The invention further provides a method of analyzing a nucleic acid from an individual to identify the presence or absence of a particular nucleotide at a given polymorphic locus and to distinguish between the reference and variant allele at each locus. The method determines which base is present at any one of the polymorphic loci shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> (SEQ ID NOs:1 or 2), or elsewhere herein. Optionally, a set of bases occupying a set of the polymorphic loci shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> (SEQ ID NOs:1 or 2) is determined. This type of analysis can be performed on a number of individuals, who are also tested (previously, concurrently or subsequently) for the presence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype in the presence or absence of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The presence or absence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype is then correlated with a base or set of bases present at the polymorphic locus or loci in the patient and/or sample tested.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, the invention further relates to a method of predicting the presence, absence, likelihood of the presence or absence, or severity of a particular HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype associated with a particular genotype in the presence or absence of an increased dose of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The method comprises obtaining a nucleic acid sample from an individual and determining the identity of one or more bases (nucleotides) at on or more polymorphic loci of the nucleic acid molecules described herein, wherein the presence of a particular base is correlated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype or an increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities phenotype in the presence of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, thereby predicting the presence, absence, likelihood of the presence or absence, or severity of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in the individual or sample. The correlation between a particular polymorphic form of a gene and a phenotype can thus be used in methods of diagnosis of that phenotype, as well as in the development of treatments for the phenotype.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; can be DNA or RNA, and single- or double-stranded. An oligonucleotide may be used as either a &#x201c;primer&#x201d; or a &#x201c;probe&#x201d;. Oligonucleotides can be naturally occurring or synthetic, but are typically prepared by synthetic means. An oligonucleotide primer, for example, may be designed to hybridize to the complementary sequence of either the sense or antisense strand of a specific target sequence, and may be used alone or as a pair, such as in DNA amplification reactions, and may or may not comprise one or more polymorphic loci of the present invention. An oligonucleotide probe may also be designed to hybridize to the complementary sequence of either the sense or antisense strand of a specific target sequence, and may be used alone or as a pair, such as in DNA amplification reactions, but necessarily will comprise one or more polymorphic loci of the present invention. Preferred oligonucleotides of the invention include fragments of DNA, or their complements thereof, of the human resistin gene, and may comprise one or more of the polymorphic loci shown or described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>, or as described elsewhere herein. The fragments can be between 10 and 250 bases, and, in specific embodiments, are between about 5 to about 10, about 5 to about 15, about 10 to about 20, about 15 to about 25, about 10 to about 30, about 10 to about 50, or about 10 to about 100 bases in length. For example, the fragment can be 40 bases in length. The polymorphic locus can occur within any nucleotide position of the fragment, including at either terminus or directly in the middle, for example. The fragments can be from any of the allelic forms of DNA shown or described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;nucleotide&#x201d;, &#x201c;base&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; are intended to be equivalent. The terms &#x201c;nucleotide sequence&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; and &#x201c;segment&#x201d; are intended to be equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Hybridization probes are oligonucleotides which bind in a base-specific manner to a complementary strand of nucleic acid and are designed to identify the allele at one or more polymorphic loci within the resistin gene of the present invention. Such probes include peptide nucleic acids, as described in Nielsen et al., Science 254, 1497-1500 (1991). Probes can be any length suitable for specific hybridization to the target nucleic acid sequence. The most appropriate length of the probe may vary depending upon the hybridization method in which it is being used; for example, particular lengths may be more appropriate for use in microfabricated arrays, while other lengths may be more suitable for use in classical hybridization methods. Such optimizations are known to the skilled artisan. Suitable probes can range from about 12 nucleotides to about 25 nucleotides in length. For example, probes and primers can be about 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, or about 40 nucleotides in length. The probe preferably comprises at least one polymorphic locus occupied by any of the possible variant nucleotides. For comparison purposes, the present invention also encompasses probes that comprise the reference nucleotide at at least one polymorphic locus. The nucleotide sequence can correspond to the coding sequence of the allele or to the complement of the coding sequence of the allele, where applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term &#x201c;primer&#x201d; refers to a single-stranded oligonucleotide which acts as a point of initiation of template-directed DNA synthesis under appropriate conditions. Such DNA synthesis reactions may be carried out in the traditional method of including all four different nucleoside triphosphates (e.g., in the form of phosphoramidates, for example) corresponding to adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine or uracil nucleotides, and an agent for polymerization, such as DNA or RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase in an appropriate buffer and at a suitable temperature. Alternatively, such a DNA synthesis reaction may utilize only a single nucleoside (e.g., for single base-pair extension assays). The appropriate length of a primer depends on the intended use of the primer, but typically ranges from about 10 to about 30 nucleotides. Short primer molecules generally require cooler temperatures to form sufficiently stable hybrid complexes with the template. A primer need not reflect the exact sequence of the template, but must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with a template. The term. &#x201c;primer site&#x201d; refers to the area of the target DNA to which a primer hybridizes. The term primer pair refers to a set of primers including a 5&#x2032; (upstream) primer that hybridizes with the 5&#x2032; end of the DNA sequence to be amplified and a 3&#x2032; (downstream) primer that hybridizes with the complement of the 3&#x2032; end of the sequence to be amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As used herein, &#x201c;linkage&#x201d; describes the tendency of genes, alleles, loci or genetic markers to be inherited together as a result of their location on the same chromosome. It can be measured by percent recombination between the two genes, alleles, loci or genetic markers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, &#x201c;polymorphism&#x201d; refers to the occurrence of two or more genetically determined alternative sequences or alleles in a population. A &#x201c;polymorphic locus&#x201d; is a marker or site at which divergence from a reference allele occurs. The phrase &#x201c;polymorphic loci&#x201d; is meant to refer to two or more markers or sites at which divergence from two or more reference alleles occurs. Preferred markers have at least two alleles, each occurring at frequency of greater than 1%, and more preferably greater than 10% or 20% of a selected population. A polymorphic locus may be as small as one base pair. Polymorphic loci include restriction fragment length polymorphisms, variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide repeats, tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements such as Alu. The first identified allelic form is arbitrarily designated as the &#x201c;reference form&#x201d; or &#x201c;reference allele&#x201d; and other allelic forms are designated as alternative forms or &#x201c;variant alleles&#x201d;. The allelic form occurring most frequently in a selected population is sometimes referred to as the wild type form. Diploid organisms may be homozygous or heterozygous for allelic forms. A diallelic or biallelic polymorphism has two forms. A triallelic polymorphism has three forms.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As used herein, the term &#x201c;genotype&#x201d; is meant to encompass the particular allele present at a polymorphic locus of a DNA sample, a gene, and/or chromosome.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, the term &#x201c;haplotype&#x201d; is meant to encompass the combination of genotypes across two or more polymorphic loci of a DNA sample, a gene, and/or chromosome, wherein the genotypes are closely linked, may be inherited together as a unit, and may be in linkage disequilibrium relative to other haplotypes and/or genotypes of other DNA samples, genes, and/or chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, the term &#x201c;linkage disequilibrium&#x201d; refers to a measure of the degree of association between two alleles in a population. For example, when alleles at two distinctive loci occur in a sample more frequently than expected given the known allele frequencies and recombination fraction between the two loci, the two alleles may be described as being in &#x201c;linkage disequilibrium&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;genotype assay&#x201d; and &#x201c;genotype determination&#x201d;, and the phrase &#x201c;to genotype&#x201d; or the verb usage of the term &#x201c;genotype&#x201d; are intended to be equivalent and refer to assays designed to identify the allele or alleles at a particular polymorphic locus or loci in a DNA sample, a gene, and/or chromosome. Such assays may employ single base extension reactions, DNA amplification reactions that amplify across one or more polymorphic loci, or may be as simple as sequencing across one or more polymorphic loci. A number of methods are known in the art for genotyping, with many of these assays being described herein or referred to herein.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Work described herein pertains to the resequencing of the human resistin gene in a large number of individuals to identify polymorphisms associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities disorders upon the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, which may predispose individuals to developing such a disorder. For example, polymorphisms in the resistin gene described herein are associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities disorders and are useful for predicting the likelihood that an individual will be susceptible to such a disorder, or that such an individual may have an increased susceptibility to such a disorder, upon the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">By altering amino acid sequence, SNPs may alter the function of the encoded proteins. The discovery of the SNP facilitates biochemical analysis of the variants and the development of assays to characterize the variants and to screen for pharmaceutical compounds that would interact directly with one or another form of the protein. SNPs (including silent SNPs) may also alter the regulation of the gene at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. SNPs (including silent SNPs) also enable the development of specific DNA, RNA, or protein-based diagnostics that detect the presence or absence of the polymorphism in particular conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A single nucleotide polymorphism occurs at a polymorphic locus occupied by a single nucleotide, which is the site of variation between allelic sequences. The site is usually preceded by and followed by highly conserved sequences of the allele (e.g., sequences that vary in less than 1/100 or 1/1000 members of the populations).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A single nucleotide polymorphism usually arises due to substitution of one nucleotide for another at the polymorphic locus. A transition is the replacement of one purine by another purine or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine. A transversion is the replacement of a purine by a pyrimidine or vice versa. Single nucleotide polymorphisms can also arise from a deletion of a nucleotide or an insertion of a nucleotide relative to a reference allele. Typically the polymorphic locus is occupied by a base other than the reference base. For example, where the reference allele contains the base &#x201c;C&#x201d; at the polymorphic site, the altered allele can contain a &#x201c;T&#x201d;, &#x201c;G&#x201d; or &#x201c;A&#x201d; at the polymorphic locus.</p>

The nucleotide sequence can also be determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Methods of Screening for HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors with Diminished Ability to Proteotyically Process Resistin</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As part of an ongoing effort to understand the mechanistic basis underlying HAART-associated lipodystrophy, resistin was evaluated as a substrate for the endogenous aspartyl proteases renin, cathepsin D, cathepsin E for the viral aspartyl protease encoded by HIV-1.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Resistin was chosen as a candidate substrate based upon genetic data that associated a single nucleotide polymorphism in resistin with the risk of developing lipodystrophy in patients enrolled on HAART therapy. The resistin SNP is described elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">There are at least two, non mutually exclusive, mechanisms that could account for elevated resistin levels in patients on HAART. Because HIV infection itself is considered to be a state of chronic inflammation, it is possible that HIV positive patients express higher circulating levels of resistin compared to healthy subjects. Indeed, it has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6, TNF, as well as lipopolysaccharide results in increased resistin expression (Kaser, S., et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 309(2):286-90 (2003), Lehrke, M., et al., PLoS Med, 1(2):e45 (2004)). Furthermore, in patients treated with HAART, it is conceivable that inhibition of endogenous proteases that regulate steady-state levels of resistin could result in increased circulating resistin levels. In genetically susceptible patients, these mechanisms could contribute to lipodystrophy syndrome.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Resistin is known to form highly-folded, multimers that are maintained via extensive disulfide bridging (Patel, S. D., et al., Science, 304(5674):1154-8 (2004)). Proteins exhibiting these properties are typically refractory to proteolytic cleavage (Patel, S. D., et al., Science, 304(5674): 1154-8 (2004)). Consistent with that expectation, preliminary protease digestion experiments revealed that native resistin was refractory to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin, suggestive of a highly folded state (data not shown). Therefore, to evaluate additional proteases, resistin was fully denatured via alkylation and reduction of cysteine residues.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Aspartyl proteases such as cathepsin D and cathepsin E are used to counter screen HIV-1 protease inhibitors for selectivity toward HIV-1 protease. It is well-established that these enzymes display relaxed substrate specificity (Dash, C., et al., Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol, 38(2):89-119 (2003), Chou, K. C., et al., Proteins, 24(1): p. 51-72 (1996)), whereas others, such as renin, display more stringent substrate specificity (Dash, C., et al., Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol, 38(2):89-119 (2003)). Four aspartyl proteases, HIV-1 protease, cathepsin D, cathepsin E and renin were evaluated for their ability to cleave resistin (MW ca. 10.4 kDa) in vitro. Incubation with HIV-1 protease, cathepsin D and cathepsin E resulted in the appearance of a ca. 7 kDa resistin cleavage product (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Additional cleavage products were not detectable by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the remaining ca. 3.4 kDa fragment was further proteolyzed. Consistent with expectation, resistin was completely degraded by the non-specific protease, trypsin, but was refractory to cleavage by the highly specific protease, renin.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The ability of resistin to be proteolytically degraded by the aspartyl proteases cathepsin D and E represents a novel finding and provides a unique insight into the physiological regulation of resistin levels. The connection between resistin, cathepsins D and E, and HAART therapy becomes apparent due to the discovery that some HIV-1 protease inhibitors vary substantially in their selectivity toward HIV-1 protease (i.e. they are also capable of inhibiting cathepsin D and cathepsin E, (Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 36(9):1787-99 (2004)).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The inventors therefore evaluated the protease inhibitors atazanavir and ritonavir for their ability to inhibit the proteolysis of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E. Cleavage of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E was not detectably inhibited by atazanavir, however, cleavage of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E was detectably inhibited by ritonavir at 30 micromolar and 10 micromolar, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Cathepsin D and cathepsin E were fully inhibited by ritonavir at 100 micromolar and 30 micromolar, respectively. Consistent with expectation, control experiments revealed that all three protease inhibitors antagonized HIV-1 protease-dependent cleavage of resistin at all concentrations evaluated. As expected, trypsin, an unrelated serine protease, was not detectably inhibited by any protease inhibitor in this study (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Additional HIV-1 protease inhibitors were also evaluated in parallel for comparison, including nelfinavir, saquinavir and indinavir. In further support of the hypothesis that inhibition of resistin cleavage by cathepsins D and E is predictive of HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are more likely to cause metabolic abnormalities, cleavage of resistin by cathepsins D and E was prevented by saquinavir, but not by nelfinavir or indinavir (data not shown). Saquinavir is known to be associated with the incidence of HIV-1 protease inhibitor induced metabolic abnormalities (Calza et al., J Antimicrob Chemother. 53(1):10-4 (2004), whereas nelfinavir (Fisac et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 88(11):5186-92 (2003)), or indinavir (Rojas et al., Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 12(5):361-9 (2003)) are not.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The sensitivity of cathepsin D and cathepsin E to ritonavir, and the proposed effect of the latter on elevated resistin levels, is indirectly supported by clinical trials demonstrating administration of ritonavir is associated with pronounced metabolic abnormalities relative to other protease inhibitors. Periard et al. show that elevated plasma cholesterol and plasma triglyceride levels were significantly more pronounced in patients administered ritonavir relative to indinavir or nelfinavir (Circulation, 100:700-705 (1999)). Manfredi, R. and Chiodo, F. demonstrated that administration of ritonavir was associated with severe hypertriglyceridaemia compared to patients administered indinavir, while hypercholesterolemia was observed in patients administered ritonavir and indinavir relative to saquinavir (J. Infect., 42:181-188 (2001)). Calza et al., also stated that &#x201c;hypertriglyceridaemia appear(ed) to be more frequent in patients treated with ritonavir, rinonavir-saquinavir, or ritonavir-lopinovir&#x201d; (J. Antimicro. Chemo., 53:10-14 (2004).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, atazanavir is known in the art to not result in significant metabolic changes. Cohen et al., describe the results of a head-to-head clinical trial comparing atazanavir with lopinovir/ritonavir therapy and noted that &#x201c;atazanavir resulted in either no change or decreases in fasting LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and fasting triglycerides . . . , whereas lopinovir/ritonavir resulted in increases . . . &#x201d; (Curr. Med. Res. Opin., 21(10):1683-92 (2005)). Further, Goldsmith et al. states that &#x201c;Atazanavir was not associated with increases in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or triglyceride levels after 108 weeks&#x201d; in another clinical trial (Drugs, 63(16):1679-93 (2003)).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Although clinical trials directed at assessing the metabolic affects of lopinovir alone appear to be limited because it is typically administered in combination with ritonavir, at least two independent groups published results that indicated lipid abnormalities did not correlate with lopinovir plasma concentrations suggesting the lipid affects were attributable to ritonavir (J. Acquir. Immune. Defic. Syndr. 35(3):324-6 (2004); and J. Acquir. Immune. Defic. Syndr. 36(5):1107-9 (2004)).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Therefore, since HIV-1 protease inhibitors vary in their potential to contribute toward the metabolic side-effects associated with lipodystrophy syndrome (Carr, A., Clin Infect Dis, 30 Suppl 2:S135-42 (2000)), it would be of utility to be able to screen preclinical compounds to reduce the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities. In this study, the inventors have demonstrated that the HIV-1 protease inhibitors atazanavir, ritonavir and lopinovir differentially inhibit cleavage of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E. Because resistin is associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Rajala, M. W., et al., J Clin Invest, 11 1(2):225-30 (2003)), and because HIV-1 protease inhibitor therapy can cause hyperlipidemia (Carr, A., Clin Infect Dis, 30 Suppl 2:S135-42 (2000)), it is conceivable, that inhibition of cathepsins D and E by HIV-1 protease inhibitors, may result in elevated resistin levels. In genetically susceptible HIV-1 positive patients on HAART therapy, this may ultimately lead to components of lipodystrophy syndrome and/or metabolic abnormalities, in general.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The present invention relates to a method for screening for HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds with a diminished ability to increase an individuals likelihood of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of the same. In specific embodiments of the invention, such a method comprises the step of combining a mixture of resistin and cathepsin D or E with either one or more test drugs, compounds, or other therapeutic agents, or a control compound; followed by the step of measuring the level of proteolyzed resistin between the test and control samples, and selecting the test compound with a diminished ability to inhibit cathepsin D- or cathepsin E-dependent degradation of resistin relative to a control compound.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The present invention relates to methods of predicting whether a patient has an increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable level of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor; whether said patient requires a lower level of administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor to limit the risk of developing said HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities; or whether said patient may be administered a higher level of administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor without the risk or of a lower risk of developing said HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities, comprising the step of assessing the level of resistin expression or resistin plasma/serum levels resulting from the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor relative to a control compound, wherein an elevated level of resistin expression or resistin plasma/serum levels is indicative of an increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities subsequent to the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, the expression level or plasma/serum level of human resistin is believed to be significantly elevated in the presence of HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are capable of inhibiting cathepsin D and/or cathepsin E thus suggesting that human resistin may be useful as a biomarker for predicting whether a patient administered an HIV-l protease inhibitor may develop metabolic abnormalities. In accordance with the present invention, an elevated basal level of resistin prior to the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor would be indicative of an increased risk of developing metabolic abnormalities subsequent to the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In addition, an elevated basal level of resistin prior to the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor would be indicative of an even greater increased risk of developing metabolic abnormalities subsequent to the administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting cathepsin D and/or cathepsin E.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">An elevated basal resistin plasma/serum level in a patient may warrant closer monitoring of the patient prior to increasing the level of administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor to limit the risk of developing said HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities, particularly if an HIV-1 protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting cathepsin D and/or cathepsin E is administered. Accordingly, an elevated basal resistin plasma/serum level in a patient may warrant lowering the amount of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor administered or changing to another HIV-1 protease inhibitor that does not inhibit cathespin D and/or cathepsin E, or at least inhibits cathespin D and/or cathepsin E to a lesser extent. Alternatively, basal or normal plasma/serum levels of resistin in a patient may justify the administration of a higher level of HIV-1 protease inhibitor with a diminished risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities. Alternatively, elevated basal resistin plasma/serum level in a patient may indicate that the patient may benefit from hypertriglyceridemia therapy which may include administration of bezafibrate either alone or in combination with an HIV-1 protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In another embodiment of the present invention, human resistin is useful as a biomarker for pre- or post-clinical screening to identify HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds that are likely to increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to prevent or diminish the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities by either advising patients be monitored more closely if such a compound or combination of compounds are administered at a corresponding higher dose, or by changing the amount of HIV-1 protease inhibitor administered or the composition of the combination. Preferably, such an identified HIV-1 protease inhibitor compound or combinations of such compounds would not be capable of inhibiting cathepsin D and/or cathepsin E.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Cells endogenously expressing human resistin can be treated with at least one test substance, and extracellular and/or intracellular levels of the biomarker resistin polypeptide in the presence and absence of the test substance(s) can be compared. The observation of high levels of the resistin biomarker polypeptide in the presence of the substance(s) can be used to predict which compounds are likely to increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to prevent or diminish the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities by not selecting such a test compound in the screen. In an additional aspect, the assays of the invention are automated for high throughput screening. The results of such screening may be used to determine the need to modify or discontinue an existing treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The present invention also encompasses microarrays, e.g., protein, antibody, or cell-based microarrays, which can be used in conjunction with the disclosed screening assays for measuring the resistin biomarker polypeptide. The protein, antibody, and cell-based microarrays can be used in the manual or automated screening assays of the invention as disclosed herein to test one or more drugs, compounds, or other therapeutic agents. For protein microarrays, polypeptides obtained from resistin expressing cells (e.g., from extracellular media or cell lysates) incubated in the presence and absence of at least one test substance can be affixed to a support, and then contacted with antibodies that specifically bind to the resistin biomarker polypeptide. For antibody microarrays, one or more anti-biomarker antibodies can be affixed to a support, and then contacted with extracellular media or cell lysates obtained from resistin expressing cells incubated in the presence and absence of at least one test substance. For cell-based microarrays, one or more cells can be affixed to a support, and then incubated in the presence and absence of at least one test substance. The microarrays can then be analyzed (e.g., by immunoassay) to determine elevated levels of at least one biomarker polypeptide in the presence of the test substance(s), which can be used to predict which compound are likely to increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to prevent or diminish the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities by either decreasing the level of the administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, or by changing the HIV-1 protease inhibitor combination administered.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The present invention additionally encompasses kits comprising one or more biomarker polypeptides, and/or anti-biomarker antibodies, which can be used to predict the likelihood of HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities of one or more drugs, compounds, or other therapeutic agents. Such kits can be used in clinical or pre-clinical settings, and can include one or more biomarker polypeptides and anti-biomarker antibodies. In specific aspects of the invention, the kits can include one or more microarrays comprising antibodies that specifically bind with these biomarker polypeptides. The kits can be employed in conjunction with the manual and automated screening methods of the invention. In various aspects, the kits can include instructions for use, and reagents and materials for measuring levels of the biomarker polypeptides e.g., in immunoassays, such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs); Western blotting; direct or indirect immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The present invention further encompasses cell culture systems for the identification of polypeptides, in addition to the specified biomarker polypeptides, whose levels (e.g., extracellular, intracellular, or cell lysate levels) correlate with increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities upon the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In specific aspects of the invention, such systems can comprise resistin expressing cell lines, which can be incubated in the presence or absence of one or more drugs, compounds, or other therapeutic agents. The biomarker polypeptides identified from these systems can be useful for identifying test substances (or combinations of test substances) that may directly or indirectly increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to prevent or diminish the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities by either decreasing the level of the administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, or by changing the HIV-1 protease inhibitor combination administered.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The present invention encompasses methods of measuring the levels of polypeptides (e.g., extracellular polypeptides in the media) using mass spectrometry data to determine the number of peptide &#x201c;hits&#x201d; for each polypeptide, and comparing the results obtained in the presence and absence of a test substance.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Also encompassed by the invention are nucleic acids encoding the disclosed resistin biomarker polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:12), and fragments, variants, and derivatives thereof, as well as screening assays, kits, microarrays, and cell culture systems employing these nucleic acids. In one aspect of the invention, screening assays (e.g., RT-PCR or in situ assays) that measure levels of one or more biomarker nucleic acids are used to predict which compound are likely to increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to prevent or diminish the likelihood of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities by either decreasing the level of the administered HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, or by changing the HIV-1 protease inhibitor combination administered. Elevated levels of one or more biomarker nucleic acids in the presence of the test substance(s) can be used to predict which patients have an increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus to identify those patients that require monitoring more closely if an increased dosage of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor is contemplated in order to avoid the potential of increasing the likelihood of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities. Alternatively, low levels of one or more biomarker nucleic acids in the presence of the test substance(s) can be used to predict which patients have a decreased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and thus identify which patients may be administered a correspondingly higher amount of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor without increasing the likelihood of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention also encompasses a method of predicting the risk that compound may increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities of a test substance comprising the steps of: a) incubating a resistin expressing cell in the presence and absence of a test substance; and b) comparing levels of at least one biomarker polypeptide, in the presence and absence of said test substance; wherein an elevated level of said biomarker polypeptide(s) in the presence of the test substance indicates that the substance is predicted to increase the risk of a patient developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in response to the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitor compounds or combinations of such compounds, and wherein the level of said biomarker polypeptide(s) is measured using single or multi dimensional high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry wherein the number of peptide hits from each protein identification are used to determine the abundance of said biomarker polypeptide(s) in the presence and absence of said test substance.</p>

In such an embodiment, detection of a polynucleotide within a sample comprising the same or similar sequence to said oligonucleotide can be detected by hybridization.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The typical dose of atazanavir to be administered to patients, for example human beings of approximately 70 kilograms (&#x201c;kg&#x201d;) body weight, is from about 3 miligrams (&#x201c;mg&#x201d;) to about 1.5 grams (&#x201c;g&#x201d;), preferably from about 10 mg to about 1.25 g, for example from about 50 mg to about 600 mg per person per day, divided preferably into 1 to 4 single doses which may, for example, be of the same size. Usually, children receive half of the adult dose.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Ritonavir is typically administered in combination with atazanavir sulfate as another agent having anti-HIV activity. When given as a protease inhibitor booster, the dosing typically ranges from 100-400 mg twice daily or, if used as a part of a once-daily regimen, 100-200 mg once-daily. Ritonavir is commercially available as a prescription medicine from Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Park, Ill., under the tradename Norvir&#xae; (ritonavir) for the treatment of HIV.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In preferred embodiments, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including allelic and variant forms thereof, have uses which include, but are not limited to diagnosing individuals to identify whether a given individual is at a higher risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities. An acceptable higher level of a pharmaceutically acceptable dose of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor for a patient identified as being at low risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities may be 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% higher than the prescribed or typical dose, as may be the case.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Modified Polypeptides and Gene Sequences</heading>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The invention further provides variant forms of nucleic acids and corresponding proteins. The nucleic acids comprise one of the sequences described in Table I, in which the polymorphic position is occupied by one of the alternative bases for that position. Some nucleic acids encode full-length variant forms of proteins. Variant genes can be expressed in an expression vector in which a variant gene is operably linked to a native or other promoter. Usually, the promoter is a eukaryotic promoter for expression in a mammalian cell. The transcription regulation sequences typically include a heterologous promoter and optionally an enhancer which is recognized by the host. The selection of an appropriate promoter, for example trp, lac, phage promoters, glycolytic enzyme promoters and tRNA promoters, depends on the host selected. Commercially available expression vectors can be used. Vectors can include host-recognized replication systems, amplifiable genes, selectable markers, host sequences useful for insertion into the host genome, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The means of introducing the expression construct into a host cell varies depending upon the particular construction and the target host. Suitable means include fusion, conjugation, transfection, transduction, electroporation or injection, as described in Sambrook, supra. A wide variety of host cells can be employed for expression of the variant gene, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Suitable host cells include bacteria such as <i>E. coli</i>, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, mammalian cells, typically immortalized, e.g. , mouse, CHO, human and monkey cell lines and derivatives thereof. Preferred host cells are able to process the variant gene product to produce an appropriate mature polypeptide. Processing includes glycosylation, ubiquitination, disulfide bond formation, general post-translational modification, and the like. As used herein, &#x201c;gene product&#x201d; includes mRNA, peptide and protein products.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The protein may be isolated by conventional means of protein biochemistry and purification to obtain a substantially pure product, i.e., 80, 95 or 99% free of cell component contaminants, as described in Jakoby, Methods in Enzymology Volume 104, Academic Press, New York (1984); Scopes, Protein Purification, Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition, Springer-Verlag, New York (1987); and Deutscher (ed), Guide to Protein Purification, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 182 (1990). If the protein is secreted, it can be isolated from the supernatant in which the host cell is grown. If not secreted, the protein can be isolated from a lysate of the host cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Haplotype Based Genetic Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The invention further provides methods of applying the polynucleotides of the present invention to the elucidation of haplotypes. Such haplotypes may be associated with any one or more of the disease conditions referenced elsewhere herein. A &#x201c;haplotype&#x201d; is defined as the pattern of a set of alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms along a chromosome. For example, consider the case of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3) in one chromosome region, of which SNP 1 is an A/G polymorphism, SNP2 is a G/C polymorphism, and SNP3 is an A/C polymorphism. A and G are the alleles for the first, G and C for the second and A and C for the third SNP. Given two alleles for each SNP, there are three possible genotypes for individuals at each SNP. For example, for the first SNP, A/A, A/G and G/G are the possible genotypes for individuals. When an individual has a genotype for a SNP in which the alleles are not the same, for example A/G for the first SNP, then the individual is a heterozygote. When an individual has an A/G genotype at SNP1, G/C genotype at SNP2, and A/C genotype at SNP3, there are four possible combinations of haplotypes (A, B, C, and D) for this individual. The set of SNP genotypes of this individual alone would not provide sufficient information to resolve which combination of haplotypes this individual possesses. However, when this individual's parents' genotypes are available, haplotypes could then be assigned unambiguously. For example, if one parent had an A/A genotype at SNP1, a G/C genotype at SNP2, and an A/A genotype at SNP3, and the other parent had an A/G genotype at SNP1, C/C genotype at SNP2, and C/C genotype at SNP3, while the child was a heterozygote at all three SNPs, there is only one possible haplotype combination, assuming there was no crossing over in this region during meiosis.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">When the genotype information of relatives is not available, haplotype assignment can be done using the long range-PCR method (Clark, A. G. Mol Biol Evol 7 (2): 111-22 (1990); Clark, A. G., K. M. Weiss, et al. Am J Hum Genet 63 (2): 595-612 (1998); Fullerton, S. M., A. G. Clark, et al., Am J Hum. Genet 67 (4): 881-900 (2000); Templeton, A. R., A. G. Clark, et al., Am J Hum Genet 66 (1): 69-83 (2000)). When the genotyping result of the SNPs of interest are available from general population samples, the most likely haplotypes can also be assigned using statistical methods (Excoffier, L. and M. Slatkin. Mol Biol Evol 12 (5): 921-7 (1995); Fallin, D. and N. J. Schork, Am J Hum Genet 67 (4): 947-59 (2000); Long, J. C., R. C. Williams, et al., Am J Hum Genet 56 (3): 799-810 (1995)).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Once an individual's haplotype in a certain chromosome region (i.e., locus) has been determined, it can be used as a tool for genetic association studies using different methods, which include, for example, haplotype relative risk analysis (Knapp, M., S. A. Seuchter, et al., Am J Hum Genet 52 (6): 1085-93 (1993); Li, T., M. Arranz, et al., Schizophr Res 32 (2): 87-92 (1998); Matise, T. C., Genet Epidemiol 12 (6): 641-5 (1995); Ott, J., Genet Epidemiol 6 (1): 127-30 (1989); Terwilliger, J. D. and J. Ott, Hum Hered 42 (6): 337-46 (1992)). Haplotype based genetic analysis, using a combination of SNPs, provides increased detection sensitivity, and hence statistical significance, for genetic associations of diseases, as compared to analyses using individual SNPs as markers. Multiple SNPs present in a single gene or a continuous chromosomal region are useful for such haplotype-based analyses.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Uses of the Polynucleotides</heading>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Increased or decreased expression of the gene in affected organisms as compared to unaffected organisms can be assessed using polynucleotides of the present invention. Any of these alterations, including altered expression, or the presence of at least one SNP of the present invention within the gene, can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a disorder, involving measuring the presence or expression level of polynucleotides of the present invention in cells or body fluid from an organism and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard level of polynucleotide expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">By &#x201c;measuring the expression level of a polynucleotide of the present invention&#x201d; is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the polypeptide of the present invention or the level of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of organisms not having a disorder. As will, be appreciated in the art, once a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">By &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d; is intended any biological sample obtained from an organism, body fluids, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which contains the polypeptide of the present invention or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as the following non-limiting examples, sputum, amniotic fluid, urine, saliva, breast milk, secretions, interstitial fluid, blood, serum, spinal fluid, etc.) which contain the polypeptide of the present invention, and other tissue sources found to express the polypeptide of the present invention. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from organisms are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The method(s) provided above may preferably be applied in a diagnostic method and/or kits in which polynucleotides and/or polypeptides are attached to a solid support. In one exemplary method, the support may be a &#x201c;gene chip&#x201d; or a &#x201c;biological chip&#x201d; as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,832, 5,874,219, and 5,856,174. Further, such a gene chip with polynucleotides of the present invention attached may be used to identify polymorphisms between the polynucleotide sequences, with polynucleotides isolated from a test subject. The knowledge of such polymorphisms (i.e. their location, as well as, their existence) would be beneficial in identifying disease loci for many disorders, including proliferative diseases and conditions. Such a method is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,659 and 5,856,104. The U.S. patents referenced supra are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The present invention encompasses polynucleotides of the present invention that are chemically synthesized, or reproduced as peptide nucleic acids (PNA), or according to other methods known in the art. The use of PNAs would serve as the preferred form if the polynucleotides are incorporated onto a solid support, or gene chip. For the purposes of the present invention, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a polyamide type of DNA analog and the monomeric units for adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine are available commercially (Perceptive Biosystems). Certain components of DNA, such as phosphorus, phosphorus oxides, or deoxyribose derivatives, are not present in PNAs. As disclosed by P. E. Nielsen, M. Egholm, R. H. Berg and O. Buchardt, Science 254, 1497 (1991); and M. Egholm, O. Buchardt, L. Christensen, C. Behrens, S. M. Freier, D. A. Driver, R. H. Berg, S. K. Kim, B. Norden, and P. E. Nielsen, Nature 365, 666 (1993), PNAs bind specifically and tightly to complementary DNA strands and are not degraded by nucleases. In fact, PNA binds more strongly to DNA than DNA, itself does. This is probably because there is no electrostatic repulsion between the two strands, and also the polyamide backbone is more flexible. Because of this, PNA/DNA duplexes bind under a wider range of stringency conditions than DNA/DNA duplexes, making it easier to perform multiplex hybridization. Smaller probes can be used than with DNA due to the stronger binding characteristics of PNA:DNA hybrids. In addition, it is more likely that single base mismatches can be determined with PNA/DNA hybridization because a single mismatch in a PNA/DNA 15-mer lowers the melting point (T.sub.m) by 8&#xb0;-20&#xb0; C., vs. 4&#xb0;-16&#xb0; C. for the DNA/DNA 15-mer duplex. Also, the absence of charge groups in PNA means that hybridization can be done at low ionic strengths and reduce possible interference by salt during the analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene, in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome, thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. In one example, polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be used to construct chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequences, specifically designed to induce host cell mismatch repair mechanisms in an organism upon systemic injection, for example (Bartlett, R. J., et al., Nat. Biotech, 18:615-622 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Such RNA/DNA oligonucleotides could be designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and/or to introduce desired phenotypes in the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and/or prevent a disease symptom and/or disorder, etc.). Alternatively, the polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be used to construct duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequence, specifically designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and/or to introduce desired phenotypes into the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and/or prevent a disease symptom and/or disorder, etc). Such methods of using duplex oligonucleotides are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention (see EP1007712, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Method of Discovering Cathepsin D and Cathepsin E Proteolytic Degradation of Resistin</heading>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As described elsewhere herein, a SNP was identified in the resistin gene, referred to herein as SNP1, that was determined to be associated with the incidence of lipodystrophy in patients administered HAART therapy. On account of the potential for HIV positive patients to have elevated plasma/serum levels of resistin, in conjunction with the fact that some aspartyl proteases may be inhibited by HIV-1 protease inhibitors, the inventors sought to determine whether either of the latter could serve as the basis for the observed association of resistin to lipodystrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The protease assays were performed as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors: HIV-1 protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinovir were purified by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography from commercial pharmaceutical preparations. Atazanavir was synthesized by and provided in pure form from the Chemistry Division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. All compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO (Sigma). The final concentration of DMSO was 0.2% in experiments that included a protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Recombinant Proteins: Recombinant human and mouse resistin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. Recombinant cathepsin D and cathepsin E were obtained from R&#x26;D Systems Inc. Recombinant HIV-1 protease was obtained from Protein One. Recombinant renin was obtained from Cayman Chemical and recombinant trypsin was from Promega.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Alkylation/Reduction of Cysteine Residues: Lyophilized resistin (24 micrograms) was resuspended in 50 ul of fresh UA buffer (8 M urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate) and 5 ul of 45 mM DTT. The mixture was then incubated at 50&#xb0; C. for 15 min, followed by addition of 5 ul of 0.1 M iodoacetamide. The reaction was then incubated for an additional 15 min in the dark at room temperature, followed by the addition of 140 ul of H2O.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Preparation of Proteases: Lyophilized cathepsin D (10 ug) was resuspended in 100 ul H2O. Cathepsin D was activated prior to use by incubating at 20 ng/ul in CathD buffer (100 mM NaOAc, 200 mM NaCl, pH 4.7) for 30 min at 37&#xb0; C. Lyophilized cathepsin E (10 ug) was resuspended in 100 ul of reconstitution buffer (25 mM MES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 6.5). Cathepsin E was activated prior to use by incubating at 20 ng/ul in CathE buffer (100 mM NaOAc, 100 mM NaCl, pH 4.7) for 30 min at room temperature. Renin was diluted to 20 ng/ul in renin buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl) prior to use. Lyophilized trypsin (20 ug) was resuspended in 500 ul reconstitution buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Trypsin was activated prior to use by incubating for 15 min at 30&#xb0; C. HIV-1 protease was used directly from the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Protease Digestion Experiments: In all protease digestion reactions, 1 ug of alkylated and reduced resistin was incubated with either 1 ug HIV-1 protease, 0.1 ug cathepsin D, 0.1 ug cathepsin E or 0.1 ug trypsin. HIV-1 protease digestion was performed in HIV-1 PR buffer (50 mM MES (pH 6), 100 mM NaCl). Trypsin digestion was performed in TE buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8)). The respective reaction buffers for cathepsin D, cathepsin E and renin are listed above under &#x201c;Preparation of proteases&#x201d;. For experiments that contained HIV-1 protease inhibitors, varying concentrations of atazanavir, ritonavir or lopinovir were added to the protease digestion reactions. Control experiments that did not contain protease inhibitor contained additional 0.2% DMSO (vehicle control). All protease digestion experiments were incubated for 24 hr at 37&#xb0; C. with the exception of experiments containing cathepsin E, which were incubated at room temperature. Reactions were quenched in LDS loading dye (Invitrogen) containing reducing agent (Invitrogen). Reactions were subsequently heated at 70&#xb0; C. for 5 min prior analysis by SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">SDS-PAGE Analysis: Cleavage products were resolved using 4-12% Bis-Tris NUPAGE&#xae; Gels (Invitrogen). Gels were run at 200 V for 20 min in MES buffer. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Gel Code reagent (Pierce).</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Four aspartyl proteases, HIV-1 protease, cathepsin D, cathepsin E and renin were evaluated for their ability to cleave resistin (MW ca. 10.4 kDa) in vitro. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, incubation with HIV-1 protease, cathepsin D and cathepsin E resulted in the appearance of a ca. 7 kDa resistin cleavage product. Additional cleavage products were not detectable by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the remaining ca. 3.4 kDa fragment was further proteolyzed. Consistent with expectation, resistin was completely degraded by the non-specific protease, trypsin, but was refractory to cleavage by the highly specific protease, renin.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In addition, the protease inhibitors atazanavir and ritonavir were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit the proteolysis of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, cleavage of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E was not detectably inhibited by atazanavir, however, cleavage of resistin by cathepsin D and cathepsin E by ritonavir at 30 &#x3bc;M and 10 &#x3bc;M, respectively. Cathepsin D and cathepsin E were fully inhibited by ritonavir at 100 &#x3bc;M and 30 &#x3bc;M, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Ritonavir is known in the art to cause metabolic abnormalities, while atazanavir is not. The above results support the hypothesis that screening for HIV-1 protease inhibitor compound that lack the ability to inhibit cathepsin D and/or cathepsin E-dependent proteolysis of resistin would be desirable in order to identify compounds that have a decreased likelihood of causing metabolic abnormalities in patients.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Method of Discovering the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Elevated lipid levels, insulin resistance and changes in body fat, collectively known as lipodystrophy, are common in HIV infected individuals (Grinspoon, S. &#x26; Carr, A., N. Engl. J. Med. 352: 48-62 (2005)). Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) is one of the strongest predictors of lipodystrophy (Grinspoon, S. &#x26; Carr, A., N. Engl. J. Med. 352: 48-62 (2005)). With the reduction in mortality resulting from treatment with HAART, these metabolic side-effects are of concern as they are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The mechanistic basis of HAART-associated lipodystrophy is poorly understood, however.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Metabolic profiles of participants in a HAART-trial were clustered to identify a sub-group of patients who had a normal metabolic profile at baseline but developed significantly elevated plasma lipid levels and insulin resistance on HAART. 189 participants of a HAART trial (Dube, M. P. et al., AIDS 19: 1807-18 (2005)) who had metabolic measurements at baseline and up to 64 weeks of treatment were analyzed. All subjects gave written informed consent. The metabolic profile for each patient after 32 weeks of HAART comprised measurements of body mass index, total, LDL, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin resistance by homeostasis model adjustment (HOMA-IR). Individuals with similar metabolic profiles were grouped together, and this process was iteratively repeated until all individuals were clustered into groups. By using change in information content as a function of cluster number, the optimal number of clusters was determined, which in this case was two. Examination of mean values of metabolic traits led to labeling one cluster normal (N=142) and the other high-risk (N=47).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The 189 individuals in these two clusters were genotyped for 285 SNPs in 135 candidate genes. Genes were selected based on their likely involvement in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, cytokines, drug metabolizing enzymes and transcription factors that regulate expression of these genes. Genes were also selected based upon those genes that had significantly perturbed expression patterns in cell-culture after exposure to protease inhibitors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were more likely to affect the activity (e.g. coding sequence changes) or expression (promoter or near splice-sites) of the gene were selected for further analysis.</p>

<p id="p-0216" num="0215">All analyses were based on data collected at baseline and up to 64 weeks of treatment. DNA was extracted from frozen blood by a third-party.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Genotyping of the SNPs of the present invention was performed using sets of TAQMAN&#xae; probes (100 uM each) and primers (100 uM each) specific to each SNP.

<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Statistical Analysis of the Association Between HAART-Dependent Metabolic Abnormalities and the SNPs of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The association between HAART-dependent metabolic abnormalities and the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the present invention were investigated by applying statistical analysis to the results of the genotyping assays described elsewhere herein. The central hypothesis of this analysis is that a predisposition to develop HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities may be conferred by specific genomic factors. The analysis attempted to identify one or more of these factors in genomic DNA samples from index cases and matched control subjects who were exposed to HAART in a clinical study (see Example 2).</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">SNPs of the present invention were examined for association with HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities using 3 (genotypes)&#xd7;2 (high risk and low risk cluster) contingency tables.</p>
<heading id="h-0029" level="1">Methods</heading>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Sample: Investigators in the BMS clinical trials diagnosed HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities in some subjects.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Measures: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human resistin were genotyped on all subjects essentially as described in Example 2 herein. The SNPs that were genotyped likely represent a sample of the polymorphic variation in each gene and are not exhaustive with regard to coverage of the total genetic variation that may be present in each gene. The SNP for which a statistical association to HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities was confirmed is provided as SNP1.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Statistical Analyses: All statistical analyses were done using SPSS&#xae; version 12 (Chicago, Ill., US).</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Clustering: Traits measured after 32 weeks of HAART were standardized to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and then used in the clustering. For each individual a profile was made of body mass index, total, LDL, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and HOMA-IR. These profiles were clustered together using &#x201c;two-step&#x201d; clustering to identify sub-groups with more homogeneous metabolic profiles. In this clustering method, data are a first grouped into sub-clusters using agglomerative clustering and then cluster assignment is refined to determine the optimal number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters was determined in two steps. First, Bayesian information criterion was calculated for the specified number of clusters to obtain an initial estimate of cluster number. Second, this estimate was refined by finding the greatest change in distance between two clusters in each stage of hierarchical clustering The distance between two clusters was defined as the decrease in log-likelihood resulting from the two clusters being combined into a single cluster. Up to 20 clusters were permitted, but the algorithm repeatedly determined that a two cluster solution was optimal. To assess stability of the cluster solution, multiple runs (N=20) of clustering were performed on different days using randomly sorted data. All runs produced clusters identical to those described earlier. Differences in means between clusters for metabolic traits and body fat were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis or repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Genetic association between SNPs and clusters was assessed using &#x3c7;<sup>2 </sup>or Fisher's exact tests.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">A C/T SNP thirty-nine base-pairs downstream of the second exon of the resistin gene was the most significantly associated with cluster membership (P=0.0003). The frequency of this SNP in the normal cluster was 0.16 and it was 0.33 in the high-risk cluster. C/T heterozygotes and T/T homozygotes were 2.7 (95% C.I. 1.3-5.3) and 19 (95% C.I. 2-183) times more likely to be classified in the high-risk cluster than wild-type (P=0.001).</p>

<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Resistin was cloned as a hormone that links obesity and insulin resistance (Steppan, C. M. et al., Nature 409: 307-12 (2001). Increased resistin resulted in mice with abnormal glucose tolerance (Steppan, C. M. et al., Nature 409: 307-12 (2001). Conversely, resistin knockout mice had lower fasting blood glucose (Banerjee, R. et al., Science 203: 1195-98 (2004)). Consistent with the genetic association observed in this study, SNPs in resistin have been variably associated with metabolic traits captured by the clusters described above including body mass index, fat mass, insulin resistance and diabetes (Engert, J. C., et al., Diabetes 51: 1629-34 (2002); Engert, J. C., et al. Diabetes 51: 1629-34 (2002); Wang, H., et al., J. Clin. Endo.

<p id="p-0239" num="0238">These results suggest that polymorphisms in the resistin gene contributes to differences in susceptibility to HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities independent of other significant predictors such as age, sex and body mass index.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The utility, in general, of each of these significant SNP-HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities event associations is that they suggest (1) such SNPs may be causally involved, alone or in combination with other SNPs in the respective gene regions with susceptibility to HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities events resulting from exposure to a HIV-1 protease inhibitor; (2) such SNPs, if not directly causally involved, are reflective of an association because of linkage disequilibrium with one or more other SNPs that may be causally involved, alone or in combination with other SNPs in the respective gene regions with susceptibility to HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities resulting from exposure to a HIV-1 protease inhibitor; (3) such SNPs may be useful in establishing haplotypes that may be used to narrow the search for and identify polymorphisms or combinations of polymorphisms that may be causally, alone or in combination with other SNPs in the respective gene regions with susceptibility to HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities resulting from exposure to a HIV-1 protease inhibitor; and (4) such SNPs, if used to establish haplotypes that are identified as causally involved in such event susceptibility, may be used to predict which subjects are most likely to experience such events when exposed to a HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities resulting from exposure to a HIV-1 protease inhibitor.

<heading id="h-0033" level="1">Method of Isolating the Polymorphic Forms of the Human Resistin Gene of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Since the allelic genes of the present invention represent genes present within at least a subset of the human population, these genes may be isolated using the methods provided in Example 4 above. For example, the source DNA used to isolate the allelic gene may be obtained through a random sampling of the human population and repeated until the allelic form of the gene is obtained. Preferably, random samples of source DNA from the human population are screened using the SNPs and methods of the present invention to identify those sources that comprise the allelic form of the gene. Once identified, such a source may be used to isolate the allelic form of the gene(s). The invention encompasses the isolation of such allelic genes from both genomic and/or cDNA libraries created from such source(s).</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In reference to the specific methods provided in Example 4 above, it is expected that isolating the polymorphic alleles of the human resistin gene would be within the skill of an artisan trained in the molecular biology arts. Nonetheless, a detailed exemplary method of isolating at least one of the resistin polymorphic alleles, in this case the variant form of SNP31(&#x201c;T&#x201d; nucleotide at 1398 of SEQ ID NO:1) is provided. Briefly,</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">First, the individuals with the &#x201c;t&#x201d; allele at the locus corresponding to nucleotide 1398 of SEQ ID NO:1 or 2 are identified by genotyping the genomic DNA samples using the method outlined in Example 2 herein. Other methods of genotyping may be employed, such as the FP-SBE method (Chen et al., Genome Res., 9(5):492-498 (1999)), or other methods described herein. DNA samples publicly available (e.g., from the Coriell Institute (Collingswood, N.J.) or from the clinical samples described herein may be used. Oligonucleotide primers that are used for this genotyping assay are provided in Example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">By analyzing genomic DNA samples, individuals with the C1398T form of the SNP1 variant may be identified. Once identified, clones comprising the genomic sequence may be obtained using methods well known in the art (see Sambrook, J., E. F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.).</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">If cDNA clones of the coding sequence of this allele of the gene are of interest, such clones may be obtained in accordance with the following steps. Next, Lymphoblastoid cell lines may be obtained from the Coriell Institute. These cells can be grown in RPMI-1640 medium with L-glutamine plus 10% FCS at 37degrees. PolyA+RNA are then isolated from these cells using OLIGOTEX&#xae; Direct Kit (Life Technologies).</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">First strand cDNA (complementary DNA) is produced using SUPERSCRIPT&#xae; Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (Life Technologies, Cat No 18089-011) using these polyA+RNA as templates, as specified in the users manual which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Specific cDNA encoding the human resistin protein is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a forward primer which hybridizes to the 5&#x2032;-UTR region, a reverse primer which hybridizes to the 3&#x2032;-UTR region, and these first strand cDNA as templates (Sambrook, Fritsch et al. 1989). Alternatively, these primers may be designed using Primer3 program (Rozen S 2000). Restriction enzyme sites (example: SalI for the forward primer, and NotI for reverse primer) are added to the 5&#x2032;-end of these primer sequences to facilitate cloning into expression vectors after PCR amplification. PCR amplification may be performed essentially as described in the owner's manual of the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following manufacturer's standard protocol, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">PCR amplification products are digested with restriction enzymes (such as SalI and NotI, for example) and ligated with expression vector DNA cut with the same set of restriction enzymes. pSPORT (Invitrogen) is one example of such an expression vector. After ligated DNA is introduced into <i>E. coli </i>cells (Sambrook, Fritsch et al. 1989), plasmid DNA is isolated from these bacterial cells. This plasmid DNA is sequenced to confirm the presence an intact (full-length) coding region of the human resistin protein with the variation, if the variation results in changes in the encoded amino acid sequence, using methods well known in the art and described elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The skilled artisan would appreciate that the above method may be applied to isolating the other novel human resistin genes of the present invention through the simple substitution of applicable PCR and sequencing primers. Such primers may be selected from any one of the applicable primers provided in herein, or may be designed using the Primer3 program (Rozen S 2000) as described. Such primers may preferably comprise at least a portion of any one of the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Aside from isolating the allelic genes of the present invention from DNA samples obtained from the human population, as described in Example 5 above, the invention also encompasses methods of engineering the allelic genes of the present invention through the application of site-directed mutagenesis to the isolated native forms of the genes. Such methodology could be applied to synthesize allelic forms of the genes comprising at least one, or more, of the encoding SNPs of the present invention (e.g., silent, missense)&#x2014;preferably at least 1, 2, 3, or 4 encoding SNPs for each gene.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">In reference to the specific methods provided in Example 5 above, it is expected that isolating the novel polymorphic resistin genes of the present invention would be within the skill of an artisan trained in the molecular biology arts. Nonetheless, a detailed exemplary method of engineering at least one of the resistin polymorphic alleles to comprise the encoding and/or non-coding polymorphic nucleic acid sequence, in this case the variant form (C1398T) of SNP1 (SEQ ID NO:2) is provided. Briefly, cDNA clones encoding the human resistin protein may be identified by homology searches with the BLASTN program (Altschul S F 1990) against the GENBANK&#xae; non-redundant nucleptide sequence database using the published human resistin cDNA sequence (GENBANK&#xae; Accession No.: NM<sub>&#x2014;</sub>020415). Alternatively, the genomic sequence of the human resistin gene may be obtained as described herein. After obtaining these clones, they are sequenced to confirm the validity of the DNA sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">However, in the case of the variant form (C1398T) of SNP1, genomic clones would need to be obtained and may be identified by homology searches with the BLASTN program (Altschul SF 1990) against the GENBANK&#xae; non-redundant nucleotide sequence database using the published human resistin genomic sequence (GENBANK&#xae; Accession No.: AC008963.9, nucleotides chr19:7638972-7641340 dbSNP ID rs3219177). Alternatively, the genomic sequence of the human resistin gene may be obtained as described herein. After obtaining these clones, they are sequenced to confirm the validity of the DNA sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Once these clones are confirmed to contain the intact wild type cDNA or genomic sequence of the human resistin coding and/or non-coding region, the C 1398T polymorphism (mutation) may be introduced into the native sequence using PCR directed in vitro mutagenesis (Cormack, B., Directed Mutagenesis Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc. Supplement 37: 8.5.1-8.5.10, (2000)). In this method, synthetic oligonucleotides are designed to incorporate a point mutation at one end of an amplified fragment. Following PCR, the amplified fragments are made blunt-ended by treatment with Klenow Fragment. These fragments are then ligated and subcloned into a vector to facilitate sequence analysis. This method consists of the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">1. Subcloning of cDNA or genomic insert into a plasmid vector, or BAC sequence if the clone is a genomic sequence, containing multiple cloning sites and M13 flanking sequences, such as pUC19 (Sambrook, Fritsch et al. 1989), in the forward orientation. The skilled artisan would appreciate that other plasmids could be equally substituted, and may be desirable in certain circumstances.</p>

<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Alternative Methods of Genotyping Polymorphisms Encompassed by the Present Invention</heading>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Preparation of Samples</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Polymorphisms are detected in a target nucleic acid from an individual being analyzed. For assay of genomic DNA, virtually any biological sample (other than pure red blood cells) is suitable. For example, convenient tissue samples include whole blood, semen, saliva, tears, urine, fecal material, sweat, buccal, skin and hair. For assay of cDNA or mRNA, the tissue sample must be obtained from an organ in which the target nucleic acid is expressed. For example, if the target nucleic acid is a cytochrome P450, the liver is a suitable source.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Many of the methods described below require amplification of DNA from target samples. This can be accomplished by e.g., PCR. See generally PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification (ed. H. A. Erlich, Freeman Press, NY, N.Y., 1992); PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (eds. Innis, et al., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1990); Mattila et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19, 4967 (1991); Eckert et al., PCR Methods and Applications 1, (1991); PCR (eds. McPherson et al., IRL Press, Oxford); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Other suitable amplification methods include the ligase chain reaction (LCR) (see Wu and Wallace, Genomics 4:560 (1989), Landegren et al., Science 241:1077 (1988), transcription amplification (Kwoh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1173 (1989), and self-sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:1874 (1990)) and nucleic acid based sequence amplification (NASBA). The latter two amplification methods involve isothermal reactions based on isothermal transcription, which produce both single stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the amplification products in a ratio of about 30 or 100 to 1, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Additional methods of amplification are known in the art or are described elsewhere herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0039" level="1">Detection of Polymorphisms in Target DNA</heading>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">There are two distinct types of analysis of target DNA for detecting polymorphisms. The first type of analysis, sometimes referred to as de novo characterization, is carried out to identify polymorphic sites not previously characterized (i.e., to identify new polymorphisms). This analysis compares target sequences in different individuals ,to identify points of variation, i.e., polymorphic sites. By analyzing groups of individuals representing the greatest ethnic diversity among humans and greatest breed and species variety in plants and animals, patterns characteristic of the most common alleles/haplotypes of the locus can be identified, and the frequencies of such alleles/haplotypes in the population can be determined. Additional allelic frequencies can be determined for subpopulations characterized by criteria such as geography, race, or gender. The de novo identification of polymorphisms of the invention is described in the Examples section.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The second type of analysis determines which form(s) of a characterized (known) polymorphism are present in individuals under test. Additional methods of analysis are known in the art or are described elsewhere herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Allele-Specific Probes</heading>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The design and use of allele-specific probes for analyzing polymorphisms is described by e.g., Saiki et al., Nature 324,163-166 (1986); Dattagupta, EP 235,726, Saiki, WO 89/11548. Allele-specific probes can be designed that hybridize to a segment of target DNA from one individual but do not hybridize to the corresponding segment from another individual due to the presence of different polymorphic forms in the respective segments from the two individuals. Hybridization conditions should be sufficiently stringent that there is a significant difference in hybridization intensity between alleles, and preferably an essentially binary response, whereby a probe hybridizes to only one of the alleles. Some probes are designed to hybridize to a segment of target DNA such that the polymorphic locus aligns with a central position (e.g., in a 15-mer at the 7 position; in a 16-mer, at either the 8 or 9 position) of the probe. This design of probe achieves good discrimination in hybridization between different allelic forms.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Allele-specific probes are often used in pairs, one member of a pair showing a perfect match to a reference form of a target sequence and the other member showing a perfect match to a variant form. Several pairs of probes can then be immobilized on the same support for simultaneous analysis of multiple polymorphisms within the same target sequence.</p>
<heading id="h-0041" level="1">Tiling Arrays</heading>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The polymorphisms can also be identified by hybridization to nucleic acid arrays, some examples of which are described in WO 95/11995. The same arrays or different arrays can be used for analysis of characterized polymorphisms. WO 95/11995 also describes sub arrays that are optimized for detection of a variant form of a precharacterized polymorphism. Such a sub array contains probes designed to be complementary to a second reference sequence, which is an allelic variant of the first reference sequence. The second group of probes is designed by the same principles as described, except that the probes exhibit complementarity to the second reference sequence. The inclusion of a second group (or further groups) can be particularly useful for analyzing short subsequences of the primary reference sequence in which multiple mutations are expected to occur within a short distance commensurate with the length of the probes (e.g., two or more mutations within 9 to bases).</p>
<heading id="h-0042" level="1">Allele-Specific Primers</heading>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">An allele-specific primer hybridizes to a site on target DNA overlapping a polymorphism and only primes amplification of an allelic form to which the primer exhibits perfect complementarity. See Gibbs, Nucleic Acid Res. 17,2427-2448 (1989). This primer is used in conjunction with a second primer which hybridizes at a distal site. Amplification proceeds from the two primers, resulting in a detectable product which indicates the particular allelic form is present. A control is usually performed with a second pair of primers, one of which shows a single base mismatch at the polymorphic locus and the other of which exhibits perfect complementarity to a distal site. The single-base mismatch prevents amplification and no detectable product is formed. The method works best when the mismatch is included in the 3&#x2032;-most position of the oligonucleotide aligned with the polymorphism because this position is most destabilizing elongation from the primer (see, e.g., WO 93/22456).</p>
<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Direct-Sequencing</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The direct analysis of the sequence of polymorphisms of the present invention can be accomplished using either the dideoxy chain termination method or the Maxam-Gilbert method (see Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd Ed., CSHP, New York 1989); Zyskind et al., Recombinant DNA Laboratory Manual, (Acad.

<heading id="h-0045" level="1">Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Alleles of target sequences can be differentiated using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, which identifies base differences by alteration in electrophoretic migration of single stranded PCR products, as described in Orita et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 86,2766-2770 (1989). Amplified PCR products can be generated as described above, and heated or otherwise denatured, to form single stranded amplification products. Single-stranded nucleic acids may refold or form secondary structures which are partially dependent on the base sequence. The different electrophoretic mobilities of single-stranded amplification products can be related to base-sequence differences between alleles of target sequences.</p>
<heading id="h-0046" level="1">Single Base Extension</heading>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">An alternative method for identifying and analyzing polymorphisms is based on single-base extension (SBE) of a fluorescently-labeled primer coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the label of the added base and the label of the primer. Typically, the method, such as that described by Chen et al., (PNAS 94:10756-61 (1997), uses a locus-specific oligonucleotide primer labeled on the 5&#x2032; terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein (F AM). This labeled primer is designed so that the 3&#x2032; end is immediately adjacent to the polymorphic locus of interest. The labeled primer is hybridized to the locus, and single base extension of the labeled primer is performed with fluorescently-labeled dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTPs) in dye-terminator sequencing fashion. An increase in fluorescence of the added ddNTP in response to excitation at the wavelength of the labeled primer is used to infer the identity of the added nucleotide.</p>

<heading id="h-0050" level="1">Method of Limiting the Risk of an HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor from Causing Metabolic Abnormalities in a Patient by Measuring Basal Resisting Levels</heading>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The inventors hypothesis that some HIV-1 protease inhibitors may significantly elevate human resistin plasma/serum levels in patients. As described herein, this effect is believed to be representative of HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are also capable if inhibiting cathepsin D and cathepsin E. As a consequence of resistin being associated with obesity and insulin resistance, it is plausible to associate increased resistin plasma/serum levels both prior to or after administration of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with an increased susceptibility to a patient in developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities or related disorder upon the administration of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Therefore, the present invention encompasses the use of assays designed to measure resistin plasma/serum levels prior or in in response to HIV-1 protease inhibitor exposure in patients to identify patients that may be at risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Resistin may be assayed from patient samples essentially as described by Yagmor, et al., (Amer. J. Gastro., 101(6):1244 (2006)). Briefly, serum resistin concentrations can be determined using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), according to manufacturer's instructions (BioVendor, LLC, Candler, N.C., USA). Patient samples are stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. at time of collection and remain freezed up to the time of resistin measurement. To ensure assay maintains a linear measurement, human serum may be diluted in a range from 1:2 to 1:8, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Generally, though any method capable of measuring the plasma/serum level of resistin would constitute a suitable method for identifying patients at increased risk of developing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities or related disorders. The lower the level of resistin, the lower the likelihood that a patient will develop HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Such an assay would also be useful for identifying levels of a given HIV-1 protease inhibitor compound in vivo that has a lower likelihood of inducing HIV-1 protease inhibitor-dependent metabolic abnormalities or related disorder in a patient. For example, it would be possible to identify a dose of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor compound using the above mentioned assay that induces lower levels of resistin plasma/serum levels, but that still has an acceptable level of efficacy.</p>
