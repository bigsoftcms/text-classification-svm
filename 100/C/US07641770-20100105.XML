<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. Ser. No. 11/320,936 filed Dec. 29, 2005.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to equipment and techniques for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands, wherein a heated enclosure and a condenser operate under a selected vacuum maintained by a vacuum pump. Tar sands are moved through the heated enclosure in a first direction, while hydrocarbon vapors are drawn toward the condenser in an opposing second direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of devices have been experimentally and commercially used for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands. Other devices are particularly intended for disposing of solid waste, such as rubber particles from used tires. One type of experimental device utilized a heated enclosure with an interior chamber and a conveyor for inputting tar sands to the heated enclosure. A condenser received vapors from the heated enclosure and output liquid hydrocarbons and gas hydrocarbons. Vacuum pumps have been used in some experimental units to maintain a selected vacuum within the heated enclosure, such that hydrocarbon vapors are drawn from the heated enclosure to the condenser. The prior art systems known to Applicants contain no effective way of monitoring the vacuum within the system at potential leak sites. Conventional packing was used on the end of auger tube shafts to maintain a vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art systems for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,624,417; 4,769,149; 4,857,458; 4,882,903; 5,429,645; 5,996,512; 6,938,562; and 6,848,375, as well as Patent Application Publications 2004/0103831 and 2004/0192980.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention, and an improved system and method are hereinafter disclosed for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a system for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands comprises a heated enclosure having an interior chamber and a plurality of internal baffles within the heated chamber, one or more input conveyors for inputting tar sands to the heated enclosure, and a flow line within the heated enclosure in fluid communication with the one or more input conveyors for receiving tar sands and positioned with respect to the plurality of baffles to provide a temperature gradient along the flow line of at least 150&#xb0; F., thereby producing hydrocarbon vapors and residual solids. A heated conveyor within the flow line mechanically moves the tar sands and the residual solids along the flow line. A heated rotary drum is provided in fluid communication with the flow line for receiving the tar sands and the residual solids, with the rotary drum having an interior temperature of from 730&#xb0; F. to 800&#xb0; F. for generating hydrocarbon vapors and stripped sand. A condenser is in fluid communication with the flow line and the rotary drum for receiving the vapors from the flow line and the rotary drum and outputting liquids including hydrocarbons and gas including hydrocarbons. One or more discharge conveyors are provided for discharging the stripped sand from the rotary drum. Two or more input control valves are each positioned along the one or more input conveyors for sealing vacuum downstream from the one or more input conveyors, with each input control valve having two or more axially spaced closure gates. Similarly, two or more discharge control valves are positioned along the one or more discharge conveyors for sealing vacuum upstream from the one or more discharge conveyors, with each discharge control valve having two or more axially spaced closure gates. A vacuum pump maintains a selective vacuum of less than 5 inches of water between the two or more input valves and the two or more discharge valves, such that hydrocarbon vapors are drawn from the flow line and the rotary drum into the condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the system for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands includes a heated enclosure, one or more input conveyors, a flow line within the heated enclosure, a heated conveyor within the flow line, a rotary drum, a condenser, one or more discharge conveyors, one or more input control valves, and one or more discharge control valves. Each of the one or more input conveyors, the one or more discharge conveyors, and the conveyor within the flow line includes a rotary auger. Each rotary auger is rotated by a drive motor and a gearbox, with a seal engaging a rotary shaft connected to each auger for sealing vacuum, and a back-up sealed enclosure downstream from the seal for sealing the auger seal from atmosphere. A vacuum pump maintains a selective vacuum of less than 5 inches of water within the condenser, such that hydrocarbon vapors are drawn from the flow line into the condenser. A plurality of leak detector sensors detect a leak within the vacuum system between the one or more input control valves and the one or more discharge control valves. A flow meter is provided for measuring a flow rate of hydrocarbon vapors to the condenser. A processor is provided for controlling the rotational rate of each rotary auger in response to the flow meter and the plurality of leak detector sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and further features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, wherein reference is made to the figures in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A system according to the present invention is well suited for recovering hydrocarbons from tar sands. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the system and method disclosed herein may be used to convert various other types of materials, including waste materials, into energy.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a belt conveyor <b>12</b> which may be used to convey tar sands from an initial dump hopper <b>14</b> into a staging hopper <b>16</b>. The conveyor <b>12</b> may be supported on a suitable frame structure <b>18</b>, with a motor and gearbox assembly <b>20</b> used to power the conveyor <b>12</b>. A magnetic drum <b>22</b> is provided adjacent a discharge end of the conveyor <b>12</b> for minimizing the amount of metal input to the hopper <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hopper <b>16</b> may be provided with a support structure <b>24</b> which includes a plurality of load cells <b>26</b> for measuring the weight of the material in the hopper. Since the conveyor <b>12</b> may be powered only intermittently as need to maintain material in hopper <b>16</b>, periodic measurements from the load cells <b>26</b> may thus be used to calculate the amount of material being input to the system over time. Material from the hopper <b>16</b> is input to the vertical auger conveyor <b>30</b>, which is powered by a drive unit <b>28</b>. Material is discharged from the upper end of the auger conveyor <b>30</b> to discharge pipe <b>32</b>, which flows into the double-dump valve <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which includes a pair of axially spaced gates <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. One of the gates <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is normally closed when the other gate is open, thereby providing a seal for the vacuum downstream from the valve <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Tar sands passing through the valve <b>34</b> is input to auger conveyor <b>40</b>, which houses a conventional screw-type auger <b>42</b> rotated by drive motor and gearbox assembly <b>44</b>. Material discharged from conveyor <b>40</b> passes through a roto disc valve <b>46</b>, which also has a pair of axially spaced gates <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Material passing through the valve <b>46</b> is input to another conveyor <b>52</b> having an internal auger <b>54</b> powered by a motor and gearbox assembly <b>56</b>. A suitable double dump valve <b>34</b> is the Model H-0822-11 valve manufactured by Plattco, and a suitable roto disc valve is the Model RD-5402-1 valve manufactured by Roto-Disc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Roto-Disc valve <b>46</b> is in series with the double-dump valve <b>34</b>, which in turn is in series with the substantially vertical auger conveyor <b>30</b>. This system provides three separate mechanisms for maintaining a vacuum within the system while allowing tar sands to pass into the system, with the valves <b>46</b> and <b>34</b> each including a pair of axially spaced gates. Any gas which bypasses the valves <b>46</b> and <b>34</b> is thus substantially plugged within the system by the tar sands within the vertical auger <b>30</b>. The plugging effect of the materials in the vertical auger conveyor <b>30</b> along with the valves <b>34</b>, <b>46</b> thus provide at least a triple redundancy to maintain vacuum within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, tar sands are discharged from the auger conveyor <b>52</b> into the conduit <b>58</b>, where it drops by gravity into the horizontal conveyor <b>60</b> with an auger <b>62</b> powered by motor and gearbox assembly <b>63</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Conveyor <b>60</b> and the auger <b>62</b> in turn are received within the interior chamber <b>64</b> of the heated enclosure <b>66</b>, which includes a plurality of baffles <b>68</b> for maintaining a desired temperature profile within the heated enclosure. Material passing through the conveyor <b>60</b> is thus heated to produce hydrocarbon vapors and residual solids. More particularly, material passes through the conveyor <b>60</b> to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and then drops to a similar conveyor <b>67</b> which includes an auger <b>65</b> for moving material to the right, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If desired, another conveyor may be in parallel with conveyor <b>67</b> to increase the surface area of exposed material. Conveyor auger <b>65</b> may be powered by motor and gearbox assembly <b>63</b>. Conveyors <b>60</b> and <b>67</b> form a flow line positioned with respect to the plurality of baffles to provide a temperature gradient along the low line of at least 150&#xb0; F., while the augers mechanically move the tar sands and stripped sands through the flow line. Material discharged from the conveyor <b>67</b> drops by conduit <b>68</b> to yet another horizontal conveyor <b>70</b>, which similarly has an auger <b>72</b> powered by motor and a similar gearbox assembly <b>63</b>. At a volume of about 2,000 pounds of tar sands per hour, the desired reaction time of the tar sands in the auger is about 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conveyor <b>70</b> reintroduces the material into the heated enclosure <b>66</b>, and more particularly into rotary drum <b>74</b> which may be rotated by drive unit <b>75</b>. The heated rotary drum <b>74</b> is thus in fluid communication with the flow line formed by the conveyors <b>60</b> and <b>67</b>, and receives tar sands and residual solids from the flow line. Accordingly to the present invention, the interior temperature within the rotary drum <b>74</b> is maintained at from 760&#xb0; F. to 840&#xb0; F., and preferably from 780&#xb0; F. to 820&#xb0; F., for generating hydrocarbon vapors and stripped sand. This reactor temperature is the result of input steam and heat generated by burner <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, material discharged from the rotary drum <b>74</b> is input to the conveyor <b>76</b>, which also includes an auger <b>78</b> powered by motor and gearbox assembly <b>79</b>. Sand discharged from the conveyor <b>76</b> is passed downward through a roto disc valve <b>82</b>, then upward through a vertical conveyor <b>84</b>, where the stripped sands within the conveyor <b>84</b> acts as a plug to assist in maintaining vacuum in the system. The auger <b>83</b> in the vertical conveyor <b>84</b> is powered by motor and gearbox assembly <b>85</b>. Material discharged from the conveyor <b>84</b> passes downward through a double dump valve <b>80</b>, and is finally discharged through conveyor <b>88</b> with auger <b>87</b> powered by a similar drive. A nitrogen supply system <b>89</b> supplies nitrogen to the stripped sand discharged from the conveyor <b>88</b>. Dry cooled nitrogen may thus be fed through the stripped sands exit assembly on the conveyor <b>88</b> to provide an inert atmosphere for neutralizing the volatility of the hot hydrocarbons and to cool these solids. A bag type dust collecting filtration system (not shown) may be used to reduce dust from the discharge carbon block solids. Any remaining gases may exit the conveyor <b>88</b> through the vertical stack <b>91</b>, and be burned in flare chamber <b>90</b>, although flaring may only be necessary in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, hydrocarbon vapors from the conveyors <b>62</b> and <b>67</b> may pass by conduit <b>92</b> into the condensing column <b>94</b>, which may then pass uncondensed vapors via line <b>96</b> to condenser <b>98</b>. Accordingly to the present invention, the condensing column <b>94</b> may be provided upstream from the condenser <b>98</b> for initially separating liquids and gases, and hydrocarbon vapors are input into a lower portion of the condensing column. Hydrocarbon vapors thus travel by vacuum in an opposite direction of the feed material through the conveyor <b>62</b>. The condensing column <b>94</b> may utilize stainless steel pall rings to provide the surface area desired to start the first step of condensing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hydrocarbon vapors leaving the condenser <b>98</b> may be passed to a demister <b>106</b>, and then to a vacuum liquid ring or gas scrubber <b>108</b>. A majority of the hydrocarbon vapors are liquefied in condensing column <b>94</b>, and further vapors are condensed in condenser <b>98</b>. The demister <b>106</b> and the liquid ring <b>108</b> remove substantially the remaining portion of the gas vapors, so that any gas discharged from the gas chiller <b>109</b> may serve as a feedstock to the burner <b>104</b>, or may be passed to a pipeline or storage tank. The gas chiller may be provided with a vacuum pump for dropping remaining heavy hydrocarbons to a liquid form. The remaining gas may be directed to the burner of the heated enclosure. A water/oil separator <b>102</b> may be provided for separating liquid carbons from water, with most of the water occurring as a result of the steam input to the heated enclosure. The reflux pump <b>110</b> may be provided for inputting a relatively low volume of oil to the top of the column <b>98</b> through the flux line <b>112</b>, with this oil acting as a quenching material to enhance the condensing process. A blower <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be provided for inputting air to the burner <b>104</b> within the heated enclosure <b>66</b>, and may be passed through the air to air heat exchanger <b>115</b> to warm the air before entering the heat enclosure, thereby increasing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A boiler <b>116</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) preferably powered by the hydrocarbons produced by the system may receive treated water and produce a relatively low volume, high temperature steam, which is preferably at a temperature at from 300&#xb0; F. to 500&#xb0; F. into the rotary drum <b>74</b> for stripping remaining hydrocarbons from the material. For processing 2,000 pounds of tar sands per hour, from 0.2 to 0.4 pounds of steam per minute may be input to the reactor at a pressure of from 3 to 5 PSI. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top view of the equipment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and more particularly illustrates a heated flowline <b>117</b> from the enclosure <b>66</b> to a boiler <b>116</b>, which produces steam which is input to the enclosure. Relatively low pressure, high temperature steam is thus input to the heated enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The introduction of high temperature steam to the tar sands results in a steam reformation or &#x201c;gasification&#x201d; of hydrocarbons from the tar sands. Most importantly, however, the steam reformation preferably occurs for tar sands in a reactor operating in the range of from 780-820&#xb0; F., which is substantially lower than temperatures conventionally used for steam reformation operations. Also, the present invention does not rely upon a nickel catalyst to perform the steam reformation, and instead uses T1 high carbon steel material for a substantial portion if not all the material contacting the tar sands while within the heated enclosure. The reaction chamber housing and the auger flights are thus fabricated from the T1 material. The T1 material enhances ion transfer, which allows the steam reformation to efficiently occur at a desired lower temperature. During long term operation of the reactor, the reaction chamber housing changes its metallic makeup into a magnetic ferrite as a result of the ion transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A refrigeration unit <b>124</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be provided for gas and water cooling. A separate water chiller <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may also be provided, and a gas accumulator tank <b>128</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Temperature and/or vacuum sensors <b>130</b> may be provided at the various locations in the system to quickly identify leaks, and to quickly locate a leak, and to provide a temperature of the material at this stage of the process. Signals from each of the signals may thus be input to a master control station <b>132</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, which includes one or more conventional computers. One or more digital flow meters <b>134</b> and digital pressure switches <b>136</b> may be provided for measuring the flow rate of gas to the condenser column or the flow rate of gas to various other pieces of the system, with the pressure switches providing an accurate reading of the pressure at selected locations within the system. The system may include digital flow meters and digital pressure gauges that will communicate with the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The conveyors within the heated enclosure may thus be operated with a level of one third material or less within each auger conveyor to increase the surface area of exposed material. The material may be retained within the enclosure <b>66</b> during a retention time of less than 15 minutes, and typically more than 8 minutes. The retention time of from 10 to 12 minutes will be appropriate for many materials.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates many of the primary components of the system in schematic form. Material from the conveyor <b>12</b> thus passes upward through the vertical auger <b>30</b>, through the double-dump valve <b>34</b>, and through the conveyor <b>62</b> into the heated enclosure <b>66</b>. Stripped sand discharged from the enclosure is passed through the vertical auger <b>84</b> and may then be shipped to a land fill.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hydrocarbons discharged from the heated enclosure <b>66</b> pass to the condensing column <b>94</b>, with gas continuing to the water tube condenser <b>98</b>, and are then input by a cyclone pump to a demister, and finally to a gas chiller. A liquid ring with a vacuum pump may be spaced fluidly between the fragmentator and the gas chiller. Other than the gas released through an emergency flare, gas from the chiller may be input to a gas accumulator, and to a gas electrical generator. Some of the gas may be returned to the heated enclosure, and other gas may pass to the boiler. Produced hydrocarbons may thus be recovered in holding tank <b>102</b>, and may be passed to a burner <b>104</b> within the heated enclosure <b>66</b> to generate heat. The system may thus primarily run on its own produced gas once the reaction starts to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A water condenser is provided with internal coils preferably fabricated from stainless steel. Water may be treated with a water softening system and will be continuously circulated through a water chiller while flowing through the condenser to maintain a constant temperature and reduce the rate of corrosion. The water softener may be used to input water to the liquid isolation chamber, and also the waste heat boiler. Steam from the boiler may be input to the heated enclosure <b>66</b>, as discussed above. The oil and water separator <b>102</b> may receive oil and water from various locations in the system, but primarily from the condensing column <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the conveyors with augers therein may include a machine shaft seal, a shaft housing, a direct drive motor, and a gearbox. The motor may be a hydraulic, pneumatic or electrically powered motor <b>144</b>, and may drive a gearbox <b>146</b> or another transmission device. The auger motor may include a programmable drive which monitors amperage and rpms of the auger, and may thus be tied to a master computer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment of a portion of the equipment discussed above. A pack column <b>94</b> and oil-water separator <b>102</b>, and a vacuum liquid ring or gas scrubber <b>108</b> are provided. Another mister <b>152</b> may be provided in the pack column <b>94</b>, and may be in communication with the liquid ring <b>108</b> to provide for a vapor exit. Tar sands or other input material may then be input to the mister <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also illustrates a velocity reduction box <b>154</b> which is provided upstream of the pack column <b>94</b>. The velocity reduction box provides a large cross section flow chamber so that the velocity of the vapors entering the pack column are reduced, thereby allowing particles to drop out by gravity and reducing the likelihood of plugging the pack column.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention may sufficiently convert various materials, including but not limited to tar sands, energy and non-energy byproducts. In addition to tar sands as disclosed herein, the invention may be used to convert solid waste, sewage sludge, animal waste, trash and refuge, solid industrial waste, coal or other solid fossil fuels into energy. Waste plastics and waste fat from animals, fryer oils and other food processing wastes may also be converted into useful products according to the present invention. The system avoids many of the problems of prior attempts to efficiently convert tar sands into energy by avoiding the requirement of a fluidized bed or other special reactions. The stripped sand is much cleaner than sand produced in prior art systems, and little or no further effort need be expended prior to disposal of the stripped sand according to this invention. The system of the present invention is relatively compact and may be placed in a small location, with the emissions from the system being relatively clean and non-hazardous. By providing a system which is essentially operating under a vacuum, the likelihood of inadvertent release of gases is minimized, while the vacuum pump draws the hydrocarbon vapors, preferably in a counter flow direction from the particles moving through the system, toward the condenser units.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The term &#x201c;tar sands&#x201d; as used herein refers to subterranean soil, e.g., sand, which contains heavy oil or other hydrocarbons therein. Tar sands can be mined and the useful hydrocarbon products extracted, and then the stripped sands returned for landfill. Most importantly, extracted hydrocarbons may be substantially reformed, so that the resultant product is substantially thinner and has a significantly higher viscosity than the oil contained in the sands. This allows the product to be more easily pumped or otherwise transported, and requires less chemical operations to crack the hydrocarbons to obtain commercially useful products. Also, the stripped sands are free, or substantially free, of hydrocarbons once passed through the equipment, so that the environmental impact of returning the stripped sands to landfills is more positive.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A particular feature of the invention is that, in addition to or in some cases separate from producing oil, the equipment of the present invention may be used to produce valuable hydrocarbon byproducts from tar sands including cleaners, solvents, and other valuable chemicals used in various industrial, oilfield, and pipeline operations. Another significant advantage of the invention is that the system does not require specialized equipment, but rather utilizes components which are generally readily available from a variety of sources.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein in some detail, this has been done solely for the purposes of explaining the various aspects of the invention, and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow. Those skilled in the art will understand that the embodiment shown and described is exemplary, and various other substitutions, alterations and modifications, including but not limited to those design alternatives specifically discussed herein, may be made in the practice of the invention without departing from its scope.</p>
