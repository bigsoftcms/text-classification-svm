<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related to the production of quinic acid and more specifically, to methods of producing quinic acid and derivatives of quinic acid from the bioconversion of a carbon source.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Quinic acid is an attractive chiral synthon with its highly functionalized, six-membered carbocyclic ring and multiple asymmetric centers. Both hydroquinone and benzoquinone, which are industrially important organic compounds, can be derived by magnesium (IV) dioxide oxidation of quinic acid. Woskrensensky, A., <i>Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. </i>27:257 (1838). Quinic acid is an important molecule utilized as an enantiomerically pure starting material for the synthesis of various molecules, many of which are biologically important. For example, quinic acid is a useful starting material for the synthesis of FK-506, an immune suppressive agent useful in preventing organ transplant rejection. Rao, A. V. R. et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i>32:547 (1991). Additionally, quinic acid has been utilized in the synthesis of the neuraminidase inhibitor GS401 and GS4104, an important new pharmaceutical for the treatment of influenza. Barco, A. et al., <i>Tetrahedron Asymmetry </i>8:3515 (1997). It is also utilized as a convenient source for the synthesis of many natural products that are otherwise difficult to obtain (e.g., mycosporin and D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate. White et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>111(24):8970 (1989); Falck et al., <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>54(25):5851 (1989), respectively. In addition, quinic acid is utilized as a food additive, resolving agent and is being used experimentally in optical materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Quinic acid has previously been isolated from natural sources (e.g., cinchona bark, tobacco leaves, carrot leaves, etc.). However, the cost of isolating quinic acid from such sources precludes its use as an economically viable starting material. Quinic acid has been synthesized chemically, but such synthesis utilizes organic solvents, highly reactive reagents and hazardous waste and as such is not environmentally desirable. Therefore, there is a need for a cost effective, environmentally desirable method for the synthesis of quinic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236 describes a method for quinic acid production that uses a heterologous biocatalyst in which expression of quinate dehydrogenase from the <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae </i>qad gene in <i>Escherichia coli </i>results in conversion of 3-dehydroquinic acid (DHQ) into quinic acid. Fermentation of this organism, <i>E. coli </i>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A (ATCC 69086) produces a mixture of quinic acid, DHQ, and 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). While the relative molar ratio of the three products varies with fermentation conditions, the molar ratio of quinic acid to DHQ and to DHS fails to exceed 2:1:1. The appearance of DHQ as a major byproduct is likely due to product inhibition of quinate dehydrogenase by quinic acid. Alternatively, the specific activity of quinate dehydrogenase may be low due to poor expression of the <i>Klebsiella </i>gene in <i>E. coli </i>or due to instability of the plasmid carrying the qad locus. The appearance of DHS may represent some instability in the host organism itself.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hydroquinone is a pseudocommodity chemical used in photographic developers, polymerization inhibitors and antioxidants. Annual production of hydroquinones is in the 40,000-50,000 ton range. Krumenacher, L. et al. Hydroquinone is currently synthesized via hydroperoxidation of p-diisopropylbenzene as well as oxidation of aniline or hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236; Krumenacher, L. et al. Aniline, phenol, or p-diisopropylbenzene are produced from carcinogenic benzene starting material, which is obtained from nonrenewable fossil fuel feedstocks. Methods have also been described for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236. The quinic acid is over oxidized to benzoquinone via hydroquinone, and the benzoquinone is then converted back to hydroquinone.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would thus be desirable to provide a method for the production of quinic acid, which method utilizes a carbon source as a starting material which can be derived from a renewable resource. It would also be desirable to provide a method for the production of quinic acid in which quinic acid is the major product at high concentrations compared to by-products such as DHQ and DHS.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would also be desirable to provide a method for the production of hydroquinone from quinic acid. It would be further desirable for the method to be inexpensive and utilize non-toxic and non-carcinogenic reactants. It would also be desirable for such a method to produce high-purity hydroquinone in good yields without overoxidation of quinic acid to benzoquinone.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A bioengineered synthesis scheme for production of quinic acid from a carbon source is provided.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A bioengineered synthesis scheme for the production of quinic acid from a carbon source is provided herein. Methods of producing quinic acid from a carbon source based on the synthesis scheme of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are also provided. Methods for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone are provided as well.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, a method is provided wherein the carbon source is converted to quinic acid by a recombinant microbe. Manipulation of the common aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway of the microbe results in a significant production of quinic acid when the recombinant microbe is cultured in the presence of a carbon source. The carbon source is converted to 3-deoxy-D-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) which is subsequently converted by 3-dehydroquinate synthase to 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ) which is then reduced to quinic acid by shikimate dehydrogenase (d, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The conversion of 3-dehydroquinate to quinic acid was discovered when studying the production of shikimic acid in <i>E. coli </i>SP1.1/pKD12.112 from a carbon source as described in Specific Example 1. Quinic acid biosynthesis is surprising given the absence in <i>E. coli </i>of quinate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the interconversion of 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid. This unprecedented activity of shikimate dehydrogenase in the interconversion of 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid has been confirmed by incubating 3-dehydroquinate with purified shikimate dehydrogenase.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Quinic acid biosynthesis, while widespread in plants, has only been observed in a single microbe, <i>E. coli </i>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A. Draths, K. M. et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>114:9725 (1992); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236. This heterologous construct expresses quinate dehydrogenase encoded by the qad locus isolated from <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. Mitsuhashi, S. et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>15:268 (1954). Quinate dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of quinic acid is driven by catabolic consumption of the resulting 3-dehydroquinic acid via the &#x3b2;-ketoadipate pathway in <i>K. pneumoniae </i>and other microbes. Reduction of 3-dehydroquinic acid by quinate dehydrogenase dominates in <i>E. coli </i>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A because of the absence of 3-dehydroquinic acid catabolism. Quinic acid synthesis in <i>E. coli </i>SP1.1/pKD12.112 thus implicates the existence of an oxidoreductase which reduces 3-dehydroquinic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bioconversion methods of the present invention are carried out under conditions of time, temperature, pH, nutrient type and concentration, aeration conditions, and controlled glucose concentrations, to provide maximal conversion of the carbon source to quinic acid. As described in detail in Specific Example 2, in a preferred embodiment, a fed-batch fermentor is used to convert the carbon source to quinic acid, followed by isolation of the quinic acid from the fermentation broth by ion-exchange chromatography. The batch fermentor process and chromatography methods are also known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;carbon source&#x201d; is meant to include biomass derived carbon sources including, but not limited to, xylose, arabinose, glycerol, glucose and the intermediates in the Krebs cycle (e.g., dicarboxylic acids), either alone or in combination. In a preferred embodiment, the carbon source is glucose. The carbon source may be derived from renewable resources such as, without limitation, corn, sugar, beets and sugar cane.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the recombinant microbe employed in the methods of the present invention is <i>E. coli</i>. In a preferred embodiment, the <i>E. coli </i>comprises a mutated aroD locus and an aroB cassette inserted into the serA locus. This recombinant <i>E. coli</i>, designated QP1.1, may further comprise a plasmid carrying aroF<sup>FBR</sup>, aroE and serA gene inserts. The blocking or impeding of aroD-encoded 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (c, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) results in the accumulation of 3-dehydroquinate which is subsequently converted to quinic acid. It will be appreciated, however, that the aroD locus mutation is not essential and is employed to further provide 3-dehydroquinate and to decrease the formation of 3-dehydroshikimate acid. The aroB gene insert encodes 3-dehydroquinate synthase (b, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), increasing the production of 3-dehydroquinate. The 3-dehydroquinate is converted into quinic acid by plasmid-localized aroE-encoded shikimate dehydrogenase (d, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the recombinant <i>E. coli </i>comprises plasmid pKD12.112 carrying aroF<sup>FBR</sup>, serA and aroE gene inserts. The aroF<sup>FBR </sup>gene insert encodes a mutant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase isozyme (a, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) insensitive to feedback inhibition by aromatic amino acids or other aromatic molecules which increases carbon flow into the common aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Due to a mutation in the <i>E. coli </i>genomic serA locus required for L-serine biosynthesis, growth in minimal salts medium and plasmid maintenance follows from expression of plasmid-localized serA. The serA insert thus allows microbial growth in minimal salts medium, distinguishing the microbes containing the plasmid from non-plasmid containing microbes. The aroE gene insert encodes a shikimate dehydrogenase, increasing the production of quinic acid. Preferably, the aroE gene is from <i>E. coli</i>. More preferably, all the inserted genes are from <i>E. coli</i>, producing a homogenous recombinant <i>E. coli. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, the aroF<sup>FBR</sup>, serA and/or aroE genes are inserted directly into the <i>E. coli </i>genome along with aroB. Such a recombinant <i>E. coli </i>would not require a plasmid to produce significant amounts of quinic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The above-described preferred recombinant microbe of the present invention, <i>E. coli </i>QP1.1/pKD12.112, has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110, under the terms of the Budapest Treaty, and has been accorded the ATCC designation number 98904. The deposit will be maintained in the ATCC depository, which is a public depository, for a period of 30 years, or 5 years after the most recent request, or for the effective life of a patent, whichever is longer, and will be replaced if the deposit becomes depleted or nonviable during that period. Samples of the deposit will become available to the public and all restrictions imposed on access to the deposit will be removed upon grant of a patent on this application.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although <i>E. coli </i>is specifically described herein as the microbe for carrying out the methods of the present invention, it will be appreciated that any microorganism such as the common types cited in the literature and known to those skilled in the art, may be employed, provided the microorganism can be altered to effect the desired conversion (e.g., carbon source to quinic acid, carbon source to 3-dehydroquinate, 3-dehydroquinate to quinic acid, etc.) Thus, it is envisaged that many types of fungi, bacteria and yeasts will work in the methods of the present invention. Such microorganisms may be developed, for example, through selection, mutation, and/or genetic transformation processes with the characteristic and necessary capability of converting one constituent of the synthesis scheme of the present invention to another. Methods for such development are well known to the skilled practitioner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to carry out the bioconversion methods of the present invention, a solution containing a carbon source is contacted with the recombinant microbe to form a bioconversion mixture which is maintained under appropriate conditions to promote the conversion of the carbon source to the desired constituent, e.g., quinic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the bioconversion mixture is maintained at a temperature of about 30&#xb0; C. to about 37&#xb0; C. and a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5. It is preferred that the bioconversion mixture also contain other substances necessary to promote the viability of the recombinant microbes such as mineral salts, buffers, cofactors, nutrient substances and the like. The bioconversion mixture is preferably maintained in a steady state under glucose limited conditions. In a preferred method the rate of glucose addition is determined by the level of dissolved oxygen concentration. A preferred steady state over the course of fermentation is about 100 to about 200 &#x3bc;mol glucose or a dissolved oxygen concentration of about 5% to about 35% air saturation. The more general requirements for the maintenance of viability of microorganisms are well known and specific requirements for maintaining the viability of specific microorganisms are also well known as documented in the literature, or are otherwise easily determined by those skilled in the art. The quinic acid may then be recovered from the bioconversion mixture by methods known in the art (e.g., ion-exchange chromatography) and further purified by recrystallization.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Novel methods for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone are also provided. In one embodiment, a method is provided wherein oxidation of quinic acid and heating of the oxidation product yields hydroquinone. In one embodiment, quinic acid is oxidized to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone which is then heated to produce hydroquinone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the quinic acid is oxidized to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone wherein the oxidation is catalyzed by an oxidizing agent. In a preferred embodiment, the oxidizing agent oxidizes quinic acid to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone but not to benzoquinone. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is chosen from the group comprising HOCl, (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/NaOCl), AgNO<sub>3</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>3 </sub>and 2KHSO<sub>5</sub>.KHSO<sub>4 </sub>(oxone)/NaCl. More preferably, the oxidizing agent is selected from the group comprising HOCl or AgNO<sub>3</sub>. Most preferably, the HOCl is formed in situ by acidifying commercial bleach (NaOCl) in the oxidation reaction mixture. The amount of oxidizing agent required is preferably about 1.0 equivalents relative to quinic acid. Alternatively, the oxidizing agent is present in catalytic amounts of less than about 1.0 equivalents along with at least 1.0 equivalents of a cooxidant. For example, 0.1 equivalents of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>can effectively oxidize quinic acid in the presence of 1.2 equivalents of K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the cooxidant is present to regenerate the oxidizing agent such that only catalytic amounts of the oxidizing agent are required.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, the oxidation reaction is carried out in an aqueous quinic acid solution. In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous quinic acid solution is a purified quinic acid fermentation broth (see Specific Example 3). In an alternate embodiment, the aqueous quinic acid solution is comprised of isolated quinic acid and water. The yield of hydroquinone may be dependent on both the aqueous quinic acid solution and the oxidizing agent. When the reaction was carried out in purified quinic acid fermentation broth, the yield of hydroquinone was 57% (mol/mol) with acidified commercial bleach, 55% (mol/mol) with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6 </sub>and 64% (mol/mol) with V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>as the oxidants. However, when AgNO<sub>3 </sub>was the oxidant, with K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8 </sub>as the cooxidant, the yield of hydroquinone from purified quinic acid fermentation broth was only 35% (mol/mol) whereas the yield was increased to 80% (mol/mol) when the aqueous solution comprised purified quinic acid in water.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further embodiment, 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone is dehydrated to produce hydroquinone. In a preferred embodiment, the 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone is not isolated after the oxidation reaction. After oxidation of quinic acid to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone, the reaction mixture is then heated to produce hydroquinone. When HOCl is the oxidizing agent, the oxidation reaction mixture is neutralized before heating. The hydroquinone can then be purified from the reaction mixture by methods known in the art (e.g., extraction, flash chromatography).</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">I. Results</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Culturing SP1.1/pKD12.112 for 42 h with K<sub>c</sub>=0.1 resulted in the synthesis of 27.2 g/L of shikimic acid, 12.6 g/L of quinic acid, and 4.4 g/L of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). DHS accumulation reflected the expected feedback inhibition of shikimate dehydrogenase by shikimic acid. Draths, K. M. et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>114:9726 (1992); Dell, et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>115:11581 (1993). By contrast, quinic acid biosynthesis was surprising given the absence in <i>E. coli </i>of quinic acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid interconversion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Quinic acid formation was further explored by collecting SP1.1/pKD12.112 cells from the fermentor after 24 h. Washed cells were resuspended in fresh fermentation medium containing shikimic acid and shaken. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, formation of quinic acid (solid bars) and 3-dehydroshikimate (hatched bars) along with a corresponding decrease in shikimic acid (open bars) concentration indicated that SP1.1/pKD12.112 was transporting shikimic acid into its cytosol. Brown, K. D. et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>428:550 (1976). Since both shikimate dehydrogenase and 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase catalyze reversible reactions, cytosolic shikimic acid could be converted back into 3-dehydroquinate. Shikimate dehydrogenase might then play a dual role by also catalyzing 3-dehydroquinate reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Because of structural similarities between 3-dehydroshikimic and 3-dehydroquinic acids (Scheme 1), purified <i>E. coli </i>shikimate dehydrogenase was incubated with 3-dehydroquinic acid.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Fermentations. Fermentations employed a 2.0 L working capacity B. Braun M2 culture vessel. Utilities were supplied by a B. Braun Biostat MD that was controlled by a DCU-1. Data acquisition utilized a Dell Optiplex Gs<sup>+</sup> 5166M personal computer equipped with B. Braun MFCS/Win software. Temperature, pH, and glucose feeding were controlled with PID control loops. Temperature was maintained at 33&#xb0; C. pH was maintained at 7.0 by addition of concentrated NH<sub>4</sub>OH or 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Dissolved oxygen (D.O.) was measured using a Mettler-Toledo 12 mm sterilizable O<sub>2 </sub>sensor fitted with an Ingold A-type O<sub>2 </sub>permeable membrane. D.O. was maintained at 10% air saturation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Inoculants were started by introduction of a single colony into 5 mL of M9 medium containing ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37&#xb0; C. with agitation at 250 rpm for 24 h and subsequently transferred to 100 mL of M9 medium containing ampicillin. After growth at 37&#xb0; C., 250 rpm for an additional 12 h, the inoculant was ready for transfer into the fermentation vessel. The initial glucose concentration in the fermentation medium was 20 g/L for SP1.1/pKD12.112 runs and 23 g/L for QP1.1/pKD12.112 runs. Three staged methods were used to maintain D.O. levels at 10% air saturation during the course of run. With the airflow at an initial setting of 0.06 L/L/min, D.O. concentration was maintained by increasing the impeller speed from its initial set point of 50 rpm to its preset maximum of 940 rpm. With the impeller constant at 940 rpm, the mass flow controller then maintained D.O. levels by increasing the airflow rate from 0.06 L/L/min to a preset maximum of 1.0 L/L/min. At constant impeller speed and constant airflow rate, D.O. levels were finally maintained at 10% air saturation for the remainder of the fermentation by oxygen sensor-controlled glucose feeding. At the beginning of this stage, D.O. levels fell below 10% air saturation due to residual initial glucose in the medium. This lasted for approximately 1 h before glucose (65% w/v) feeding started. The PID control parameters were set to 0.0 (off) for the derivative control (&#x3c4;<sub>D</sub>) and 999.9 s (minimum control action) for integral control (&#x3c4;<sub>I</sub>).

When dissolved oxygen levels exceeded the set point value indicating decreased microbial metabolism, the rate of D-glucose addition was increased. When dissolved oxygen levels declined below the set point value indicating increased microbial metabolism, the rate of D-glucose addition was decreased. Proportional-integral-derivative control (PID) was used to control the rate of D-glucose addition.</p>

Extracellular accumulation of quinic acid began in early to mid log phase of microbial growth as represented by the open boxes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The dry cell weight is represented by the solid line and closed circles. 3-Dehydroquinate was efficiently converted to quinic acid as there was never a build-up of the intermediate (solid bars in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). After 60 hours of cultivation with K<sub>c</sub>=0.1, <i>E. coli </i>QP1.1/pKD12.112 synthesized 60 g/L of quinic acid in 23% yield along with only 2.6 g of 3-dehydroquinate.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Microbial synthesis of quinic acid may supplant isolation of this hydroaromatic from plant sources which has limited its synthetic utility. At the same time, increased availability of quinic acid may portend wider utilization of this hydroaromatic. The theoretical maximum yield of microbial synthesis of quinic acid is 43% from D-glucose. Draths, K. M. et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>117:2395 (1995). Comparison with the yields achieved thus far for microbial synthesis of quinic acid (23%) along with the apparent lack of toxicity of this hydroaromatic towards the microbial biocatalyst, suggest that sizable increases in yields and titers are possible.</p>
