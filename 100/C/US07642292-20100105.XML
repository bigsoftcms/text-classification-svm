<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A process and system for producing hydrocarbon compounds or fuels that recycle products of hydrocarbon compound combustion&#x2014;carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, or both, and water. The energy for recycling is electricity derived from preferably not fossil based fuels, like from nuclear fuels or from renewable energy. The process comprises electrolyzing water, and then using hydrogen to reduce externally supplied carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, then using so produced carbon monoxide together with any externally supplied carbon monoxide and hydrogen in Fischer-Tropsch reactors, with upstream upgrading to desired specification fuels&#x2014;for example, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, and others. Energy released in some of these processes is used by other processes. Using adiabatic temperature changes and isothermal pressure changes for gas processing and separation, large amounts of required energy are internally recycled using electric and heat distribution lines. Phase conversion of working fluid is used in heat distribution lines for increased energy efficiency. The resulting use of electric energy is less than 1.4 times the amount of the high heating value of combustion of so produced hydrocarbon compounds when carbon dioxide is converted to carbon monoxide in the invention, and less than 0.84 when carbon monoxide is the source.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the field of hydrocarbon compound production and, more specifically, to energy efficient processes and systems that produce hydrocarbon compound fuels. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus and a method to convert electric energy into hydrocarbon compound fuels, such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel, among others, and which are produced by recycling products of combustion&#x2014;carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although the idea for developing synthetic hydrocarbon fuels has been discussed for at least the last 30 years, there has not been a need to produce them because of the availability, ease of production, transportation, and processing of fossil fuels. However, the worldwide fossil fuel market is changing due to a number of factors, including steadily increasing worldwide energy demand, increasing concentration of production in oil producing regions, and increasing emphasis in oil dependant countries on the importance of energy supply.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are several disadvantages to using fossil fuels. First, there is a finite amount of fossil fuels available which, once used, cannot be regenerated. Additionally, hydrocarbon fuels made from fossil fuels may contain highly undesirable sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatic compounds. When these fuels are burned, sulfur, nitrogen, and particulates are released into the air, which leads to the formation of acid rain and smog. More recently, concern has focused on the impact of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion as a contributor to global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several well-established processes for direct hydrogenation of gases such as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide to produce hydrocarbon fuels. One of the most successful was developed in Germany in the 1 920s by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In 1938, early German plants produced approximately 5 million barrels per year of diesel oil and gasoline using the Fischer-Tropsch process, which reacts carbon monoxide and hydrogen over a catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons and water. The problem with this and other methods is that they use fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas to produce the carbon monoxide. The use of such fossil fuels as the primary feedstock is accompanied by many of the same drawbacks as the production of fossil fuels such as finite supply and emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it can be seen that there is a long-felt need for a production system that recycles the products of combustion into hydrocarbon compound fuels. It is to such a system and processes for making hydrocarbon compounds that the present invention is primarily directed, with emphasis on energy efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention comprises systems, methods and compositions for the production of synthetic hydrocarbon compounds, particularly hydrocarbon compounds that can be used as fuels. In general, species of carbon oxides, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, are converted into one or more hydrocarbon compounds, comprising carbon and hydrogen, including but not limited to diesel fuel, gasoline, jet fuels, liquefied petroleum gas, or compounds found in natural gas. A particular process comprises forming, with electricity, a hydrogen stream, and in the presence of at least a portion of the hydrogen from the hydrogen stream, converting at least a portion of the carbon monoxide present in a carbon monoxide stream, into a hydrocarbon compound.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the system with a carbon dioxide input, the amount of input electric energy needed to convert carbon dioxide into high heating value of output hydrocarbon compounds combustion energy is in a range of between 1.4 and 1.1. In another preferred embodiment of the system with a carbon monoxide input (thus eliminating the need to convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide), the external electric energy needed to convert carbon monoxide is between 0.64 and 0.84 of the high heating value of hydrocarbon compounds. That is, in an embodiment of the present invention using carbon dioxide as an input, more electric energy will be required than the high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds produced. In another embodiment of the present invention, using carbon monoxide as an input, less electric energy will be required than the high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds produced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, it is possible to produce within one plant on the order of five hundred thousand gallons of fuel per day, or even more, in case sufficient electric energy, carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide are available.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the invention comprises systems and methods comprising an electrolyser and a Fisher-Tropsch reactor, and in some embodiments, also a reverse water gas shift reactor, for producing hydrocarbon compounds. The present invention comprises methods and systems for producing hydrocarbon compounds comprising converting at least a portion of one of the species of carbon oxide, including but not limited to carbon monoxide, into hydrocarbon compounds, via a Fischer-Tropsch process in the presence of at least a portion of the hydrogen stream; and transferring at least a portion of excess heat from the Fischer-Tropsch process to one of the other process steps in the method or system, to a portion of a method or system requiring energy, or one of the other units in the system, for example, to an electrolyser or a reverse water gas shift reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, there are numerous places where certain gases must be separated from a gas mixture, or for example, gas parameters such as temperature and pressure, must be changed to make one or both compatible with an upstream or downstream process. These separations or changes to gases in the invention consume large amounts of energy. It is a novel aspect of the invention that energy can be transferred within the invention to meet the energy needs for gas separations and changes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One advantage of the present invention is its energy efficient gas processing. There are generally two energy efficient thermodynamic processes used for gas processing. The first one is an adiabatic process when all external work is converted to or from gas energy. The second one is an isothermal process, when all external work is either converted into heat or derived from heat. By recycling external work through an electrical distribution line and heat through several heat distribution lines, energy losses in gas processing are substantially reduced. This is also assisted by use of phase conversion of working fluids in heat distribution lines to accept or deliver heat energy.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention comprises systems and methods that provide the ability to produce a variety of hydrocarbon compounds, such as compounds for different fuels and a degree of control in producing one or more specific types of hydrocarbon fuels that is not found with currently available methods for making synthetic fuels. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention comprises systems, methods and compositions for making hydrocarbon compounds. Complete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels like coal, natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and other known fuels primarily results in two basic substances&#x2014;carbon dioxide and water. When burning such fuels, the main reaction is as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, for an average value of n=10, 10% more moles of water is produced than carbon dioxide. The number of oxygen moles used is equal to a sum of one mole for oxidizing carbon and a half of a mole plus 10% to oxidize hydrogen, 1.55 moles in total. As used herein, &#x201c;High Heating Value&#x201d; (HHV) is the amount of heat produced by the complete combustion of a unit quantity of fuel when all products of the combustion are cooled down to the temperature before the combustion and the water vapor formed during combustion is condensed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the invention described herein, the products of combustion, carbon oxides and hydrogen are recombined into hydrocarbon compounds, such as transportation fuels, including but not limited to, diesel and gasoline. It is also possible to recombine them into other compounds and compositions such as natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. As used herein, hydrocarbon compounds include hydrocarbon compounds that may be used as an energy source such as fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hydrocarbon compounds may be produced using a Fischer-Tropsch process. In this part of this process and system, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen are ideally reacted as follows:

wherein (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) is a building block for polymerization into longer carbon chains. The primary products of this polymerization are linear paraffins, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>, plus two hydrogen atoms to complete any chain at the ends. In this reaction, one hydrogen molecule is used for formation of hydrocarbons, plus approximately 10% for completing chains at the ends, and another hydrogen molecule is used to reduce carbon monoxide to carbon.
</p>

For example, the invention may incorporate a source of electric energy, an electrolyser, a RWGS reactor, an FT reactor, and a post-processing plant.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment of the present invention, there is a source of electric energy generated from the heat of a nuclear reactor. An example is a fast breeder reactor. This reactor may be setup once with reprocessed nuclear waste, and then its nuclear core may be reprocessed at a re-processing plant. This has the advantage of extending the energy output from the world's uranium reserves on the order of 25 fold or so. At typical re-processing intervals of five years, there is plenty of initial fuel to power the present invention until the end of the physical plants' useful life. Alternatively, the energy may be provided by nuclear reactor waste heat conversion, a thermochemical process, or other sources, including fossil fuel free electricity, such as hydro, solar, ocean waves, wind, tides or currents, and combinations of any of these sources.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Electric energy may be used to electrolyse water to create hydrogen and oxygen. In some embodiments, the electrolyser may need a substantial amount of heat for operation. This heat, together with water for the operation, may be supplied by steam generated elsewhere in the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While hydrogen may be produced by conventional electrolysis of water using electrodes, other methods can be employed, including the thermolysis of water (for example using waste heat from nuclear reactors), thermochemical processes, and combinations of these methods. Oxygen produced in the electrolyser may be put to uses outside of the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The process of electrolysing water for the production of hydrogen preferably includes an electrolyser comprising bipolar electrodes and a cell average operating temperature over 100&#xb0; C., or over 130&#xb0; C., wherein cell internal pressures are over 10 bar, or over 20 bar. Other embodiments include that the electric current density is over 3,000 A/m<sup>2</sup>, that a stack of cells is used with voltages over 60 V, and/or that AC-to-DC voltage rectifiers are used, with an output voltage ripple less than 3%.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">There are numerous uses in the plant for the hydrogen produced in the electrolyser. Among them, hydrogen and carbon dioxide can be used together in the RWGS reactor to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A source of carbon dioxide for the present process is a plant emitting carbon oxides, such carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide as a byproduct, especially a plant that is required to reduce its carbon oxide emissions. Examples of such a plant include a blast furnace used to produce steel, and fossil fuel power plants using coal or gas to produce electricity. Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or carbon oxides or a mixture may be provided by any method, including but not limited to, externally provided from any source.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A method of converting carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is through the use of a RWGS reactor. An aspect of the invention comprises methods and systems wherein carbon dioxide and hydrogen are supplied to a RWGS reactor, and there is a substantially complete conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, for example, a conversion of over 70%, more preferably over 80%, and more preferably still, over 90%. The output or effluent stream of the RWGS reactor comprises carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of between zero and three. Further, there are included means of separation of a portion of carbon dioxide on the output, and recycling of the carbon dioxide to the input. Other preferred embodiments may include that the operating temperature is between 350-500&#xb0; C., that there is provided steam separation by condensation, and that more than one reactor can be sequential, serially connected. An embodiment may comprise intermediate separation of steam between serially connected RWGS reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As a byproduct of the RWGS reactor operation, water is produced that may be used to feed an electrolyser.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A syngas effluent, which is generally a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and some residual carbon dioxide, is fed from a RWGS reactor to an FT reactor. Additional hydrogen may be added to the syngas, or to carbon monoxide, as required for the desired output of an FT reactor. It is also possible to use carbon monoxide, such as waste carbon monoxide from existing industrial processes, and combine this carbon monoxide with hydrogen instead of, or in addition to, the syngas stream produced by the RWGS reactor. Aspects of a plant of the present invention include methods that use carbon monoxide without the need for the intermediate step of converting carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, thereby bypassing the RWGS process.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An FT unit of the present invention, which may include more than one FT reactors, primarily provides conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to hydrocarbon compounds, at rates that are desirable, for example, a conversion of over 70%, more preferably over 80%, and more preferably still, over 90%. In the present invention, the methods and systems provide that the reaction heat removal is at substantially isothermal conditions. Additionally, the hydrogen supply is controlled, for example, for minimum production of methane and ethane. Other embodiments include that steam and gaseous hydrocarbon output separation using condensation caused by change of both temperature and pressure are provided, and that more than one FT reactor may be sequential or serially connected or having more than one reactor operating at substantially different temperatures and associated operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The catalyst for the FT reaction can be a metal such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and combinations thereof, a metal oxide such as iron oxide, cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, ruthenium oxide, and combinations thereof, support-type material such as alumina or zeolites; supported metals, mixed metals, metal oxides, mixed metal oxides; and combinations of these catalysts, and others known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The main output of the FT reactor is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds with a byproduct of water that can have a variety of uses such as being fed to the electrolyser. The FT reaction is highly exothermic, and the heat can be used in a variety of ways. For example, at least a portion of the heat can be removed by a water stream being converted to steam with that steam then being fed to the electrolyser if required.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The mixture of hydrocarbon compounds exiting an FT reactor may be fed to a post-processing plant that can be similar, or in many ways simpler, than existing hydrocarbon fuel refineries as no removal of sulfur or nitrogen compounds is required. Some amount of hydrogen compounds can be used in this post-processing, refining process to yield compositions comprising combustible compounds. Such compositions may be used as fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Upon post-processing, desired transportation grade fuel compositions are provided, that can include high-octane gasoline and diesel fuel of a composition reducing or even eliminating need for after-treatment in vehicles. The fuel compositions produced from the present process avoid many of the inherent drawbacks of processing crude oil, i.e. these compositions have no sulfur content, no nitrogen content, and no aromatics content. They do, however, have high volumetric and gravimetric energy densities, an excellent resistance to thermal oxidation processes, are fire safe (i.e., they are hard to ignite), and good low temperature properties.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The present system further provides for methods using separators, for separation of gases in a gas mixture, for example, in a novel and inventive combination of heat exchangers and compressors/expanders. The systems may include the use of compressors or expanders with heating or cooling to condition gas mixtures for condensation of a selected gas in a mixture, wherein expanders and compressors are used to condition gas mixtures to the desired temperatures. The systems may use heat exchangers for condensation or evaporation of a selected gas, with phase conversion of a cooling fluid into its vapor or steam as appropriate. Other embodiments include methods comprising phase conversion of a working fluid that is used for heating or cooling, along with either compression or expansion of gases. Heat machines, for example, heat pumps using a compressor, can be used to move heat from a low temperature area to a high temperature area, and heat removers using an expander-generator (electric power generation) may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention provides energy efficient systems that use energy, such as electric energy, for the conversion of carbon oxides, including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and water into hydrocarbon fuels on a production scale. A system of the present invention also comprises use of residual internal heat for electricity generation, which electricity is used for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water conversion into hydrocarbon fuels. A system may also comprise compressors and expanders used for conditioning and for separation of gas mixture components.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention further incorporates one or more subsystems comprising transferring heat or steam between components of the system, including the transfer of heat from FT reactor(s) to an electrolyser either directly or via conversion to electric energy, feeding reaction steam from FT reactor(s) for condensation in an electrolyser, transferring heat from FT reactor(s) for use throughout the system by users of heat, via the use of heat exchange methods, transferring heat from FT reactor(s) to RWGS reactors along with associated input/output gas processing, heating reaction water from RWGS and/or FT reactors for use in an electrolyser, and supplying heat to gas-liquid phase conversion for cooling and heating of process gases and liquids.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises, in essence, a method of the present invention <b>100</b> being a method of converting one or more species of carbon oxides into hydrocarbon fuels F using electricity as the energy input E. The output fuels F can include, for example, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate general, high-level systems of the present invention <b>100</b>, each embodying its own novelty and inventive step, as described below, and together, forming a preferred process of the present invention <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">While it is known to produce hydrocarbon fuels from coal and gas, the use of electricity to drive the conversion has previously been avoided. The industry has refrained from developing methods of producing fuels from carbon oxides using electricity because the energy efficiencies were simply too low to justify the cost. Yet, the energy efficiency of the present invention is greater than 60%; that is, the ratio of the high heating value of the fuels F to the amount of electricity E required to drive the conversion(s), is greater than 60%, and more preferably greater than 80%. In reverse ratio, it means that the amount of electric energy is approximately lower than 1.7 (1/60%) times of the high heating value of the fuel F, and more preferably lower than 1.25 times.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In yet another high level view of the present invention <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present process comprises an energy input step <b>200</b> providing energy to the process, a conversion step <b>300</b> converting the one or more species of carbon oxides to fuel F, and a hydrogen input step <b>400</b> providing hydrogen to efficiently drive the conversion <b>300</b> of the carbon oxides to fuel Referring to the conversion step <b>300</b> converting the carbon oxide to fuel F, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can include at least two subsystems, one, a carbon monoxide conversion step <b>320</b> for the conversion of carbon monoxide to fuel F, and a second, a carbon dioxide conversion step <b>360</b>, should the process of the present invention <b>100</b> be presented with carbon dioxide. The conversion step <b>360</b> converts carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, and then feeds the carbon monoxide to the carbon monoxide conversion step <b>320</b>. Alternatively, or in combination with the carbon monoxide from the conversion step <b>360</b>, carbon monoxide can be fed to conversion step <b>320</b> from outside the system of the present invention <b>100</b>, for example, from a plant's carbon monoxide waste stream or a mixture of CO<sub>2 </sub>and CO can be fed to step <b>360</b> to convert CO<sub>2 </sub>to CO.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Both conversion steps <b>320</b>, <b>360</b> utilize at least a portion of the hydrogen from hydrogen input step <b>400</b> to drive their respective conversions. In one preferred embodiment, the invention <b>100</b> is presented with both carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, and thus the process of the present invention <b>100</b> utilizes both conversion steps <b>320</b>, <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an intermediate step <b>500</b> is shown located between the output of the conversion step <b>300</b> converting the carbon oxide, and the final product fuels F. Typically, the output of the conversion step <b>300</b> is a spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds HC, out of which only some can be used in fuels. Thus, a post-processing step <b>500</b> is provided to upgrade them to the desired compositions, for example, fuels F.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferred embodiments of various subsystems of the present invention <b>100</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, and comprise a recycling process, and plant, to produce hydrocarbon fuels from the products of hydrocarbon fuel combustion. The invention includes the energy input step <b>200</b> providing energy to the process, including generating electricity using nuclear power reactors <b>210</b>, preferably using fast breeder reactors consuming existing nuclear waste. A reactor <b>210</b> can be setup once with reprocessed nuclear waste, and then its nuclear core can be reprocessed at, for example, a re-processing plant <b>220</b> to extend the energy output from the world's Uranium reserves, perhaps 25 fold or more. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, at typical re-processing intervals of five years, there is enough initial fuel to power the present invention until the end of its useful life.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The electricity is provided to the hydrogen input step <b>400</b>, which can include electrolysing water in an electrolyser <b>410</b> to form streams of hydrogen and oxygen. Heat, also called thermal energy, from other subsystems of the process of the present invention <b>100</b> can be supplied to this step, to improve efficiencies. It can be supplied either directly to heat water when required or through conversion to electricity to conduct electrolysis. Some known types of electrolysers <b>410</b> may need some heat for operation. This heat, together with water for electrolyser operation, is preferably supplied primarily by steam generated elsewhere in the system of the present invention <b>100</b>. There are numerous uses for hydrogen produced in the electrolyser <b>410</b> throughout the system, while it is preferred that most, if not all, of the oxygen produced is put to revenue generating uses outside the system of the present invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At least a portion of the hydrogen is fed to the conversion step <b>300</b>, which, if the system of the present invention <b>100</b> handles both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, is a two-step process. In the first process, a carbon dioxide conversion step <b>360</b> is employed, including a reverse water gas shift process, namely a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reactor <b>362</b>, to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. As a byproduct of the RWGS reactor operation, steam is produced that is fed to the electrolyser <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A source of carbon dioxide for the conversion step <b>360</b> may be a plant emitting carbon dioxide as a byproduct, especially a plant that is required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The prime examples of such plants are blast furnaces used to produce steel, and fossil fuel power plants using coal or gas to produce electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Carbon dioxide can come in a mixture with carbon monoxide. This mixture can be either separated into carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide or processed as a mixture in the reactor <b>362</b> completing conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The syngas is then fed to the carbon monoxide conversion step <b>320</b>, including a Fisher-Tropsch process to combine carbon monoxide and hydrogen to provide a spectrum of hydrocarbons based on a double bond radical. The carbon monoxide conversion step <b>320</b> can include a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor <b>322</b>. While the FT reactor <b>322</b> can use the syngas from step <b>360</b>, it is also possible to use waste carbon monoxide from existing industrial processes, and combine this waste carbon monoxide with hydrogen, instead of, or in addition to, syngas produced by the RWGS reactor <b>362</b>. As is known, there are number of processes that produce carbon monoxide as waste, especially in combination with carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one preferred embodiment of the present system of the present invention <b>100</b>, only carbon monoxide is processed, (not carbon dioxide), as this materially eliminates the need for the RWGS process <b>360</b>. The system of the present invention <b>100</b> can also use a mixture of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide as waste from industrial processes supplying such a mixture. Additional hydrogen can be added to the syngas output of step <b>360</b>, and/or to the carbon monoxide input to step <b>320</b>, as required to adjust the desired output of the FT reactor <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The main output of the FT reactor <b>322</b> is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds based on &#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)&#x2014; radical and a byproduct is water, which is preferably fed to the electrolyser <b>410</b>. The FT reaction is highly exothermic, so heat is removed at least by providing water, which is converted to steam, which can be used directly or indirectly as a source of energy for electrolyser <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The hydrocarbon compounds output from the FT reactor can be characterized as a version of crude oil, in that the hydrocarbon compounds, like crude oil, can be refined using known techniques, to yield fuel compounds. Thus, the hydrocarbons are upgraded, or refined, at step <b>500</b>, including a fuel post-processing step, to produce the desired compositions of fuels F. Step <b>500</b> can include a post-processing (upgrading) plant <b>510</b> that is similar, but generally simpler, with fewer processing steps needed, than in existing crude oil refineries. Such refining techniques are known to those skilled in the art. Again, some amount of hydrogen from step <b>400</b> may be used in this refining process <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present invention uses multiple energy distribution lines, gas flow recycling/feedback loops, and inter-process heat and electricity exchanges. The overall results of the various improvements in each of the subsystems of the present invention <b>100</b>, and in system-wide efficiencies, provide a system wherein preferably at least 60% of the energy input to the process (for example, from the electricity generated by the nuclear power plant) is ultimately contained in the high heating value of combustion output fuels F.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The system of the present invention <b>100</b> produces beneficial byproducts, as its outputs are fuels, and oxygen. In addition, the system of the present invention <b>100</b> provides a critical externality in that it reduces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that, because it is a prime contributor to global warming, is the subject to a variety of worldwide Treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol, and national and regional implementing regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As described, the final outputs of this recycling process of the present invention <b>100</b> are many desired transportation fuels, which can include high-octane sulfur free gasoline and sulfur free diesel fuel of a composition reducing or even eliminating the need for after-treatment in vehicles. One advantage of this system of the present invention <b>100</b> is its ability to produce a variety of hydrocarbon compound fuels. Another advantage is the degree of control available to plant operators to alter the ratio of hydrocarbon compounds produced by adjusting particular parameters of the methods and system, for example, the ratio of carbon monoxide and hydrogen fed to particular FT reactors. By varying the amounts of syngas fed to different types of FT reactors, it is possible to achieve different output ratios of diesel fuel, gasoline, jet fuel, and other fuels out of the total amount of syngas input.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The system of the present invention <b>100</b> is described in further detail below, including preferred embodiments of the various subsystems of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Energy Distribution Lines</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The system of the present invention <b>100</b> incorporates several energy distribution lines with two distinctive types of energy lines&#x2014;electric and heat. Examples of energy distribution lines employed by the present system are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. At least one electric energy distribution line (EDL) is used. For example, one EDL is a conventional three-phase alternating current electric power distribution line operating at a conventional phase-to-phase voltage in the 10-50 kV range, a range practiced in commonly-used electric power generators. However, other voltages can be used as dictated by specific needs as would be commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Numerous generators and motors are connected to the EDL in this system. Generators are preferably of a synchronous type, conventionally controlled to match frequency, phase, and voltage amplitudes, so they can all feed the EDL in parallel.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a preferred system of the present invention <b>100</b>, there are other energy distribution lines, distributing heat, or thermal energy, (as opposed to electric energy) throughout the plant. The heat distribution lines (HDL) in this system can accept heat from a heat sources, and deliver heat to a heat users.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Phase conversion of a working fluid is used in the heat distribution lines. Each line uses two reservoirs&#x2014;one of a liquid and another of a vapor of this liquid, both close to the boiling temperature and pressure of that working fluid. When heat delivery is required, vapor is taken from one half of the line, condensed, and delivered to the liquid half of the line. Condensation heat is released to a user of heat. When there is a need to take heat, then liquid is taken, vaporized, and delivered as vapor to the vapor half of the line. External heat is consumed by evaporation of working fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In a preferred embodiment, there are five distinct temperatures for each of the five heat distribution lines.</p>

It is also possible to use a separate cooling loop for the FT reactor operating at higher temperatures using other working fluids, for example, ethylene glycol, and exchange some or all of its heat into this second HDL. In further description herein, this third HDL will sometimes be referred to this line as &#x201c;FT-line&#x201d;, denoting its steam part with an &#x201c;S&#x201d;, and its water part with a &#x201c;W&#x201d;.</p>

In further description herein, this third HDL will sometimes be referred to this line as &#x201c;E-line&#x201d;, denoting its steam part with an &#x201c;S&#x201d;, and its water part with a &#x201c;W&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A fourth HDL is at ambient temperature, at 25&#xb0; C. in an example of a preferred embodiment of the system, but can be at other ambient temperatures at various locations and weather conditions of this system.

<p id="p-0123" num="0124">Carbon dioxide conversion is preferably run through a RWGS process <b>360</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a preferable carbon dioxide conversion system comprises an RWGS reactor <b>362</b> that converts incoming carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using hydrogen as a reducing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">The basic reaction is as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="2.46mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US07642292-20100105-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>CO+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">This is a reversible reaction, and its equilibrium coefficient to convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is low. For this reason, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, excess of incoming gases, both carbon dioxide and hydrogen, are used to increase the amount of carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">The amount of hydrogen is enough for both (i) conversion to water inside the reactor and (ii) up to a desired level of mixture H<sub>2</sub>/CO (syngas) to feed the FT reactor <b>322</b>. In this embodiment, this ratio H<sub>2</sub>/CO is around two, so the amount of hydrogen moles is approximately up to three times the number of input carbon dioxide moles. Depending on the FT catalyst used, other H<sub>2</sub>/CO values for feed to the FT reactor are also acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">The amount of carbon dioxide at the input of the reactor <b>362</b> is preferably enough to achieve complete conversion of incoming carbon dioxide at a selected operating temperature of the reactor <b>362</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the RWGS process <b>360</b> has a 400&#xb0; C. operating temperature, and a three-stage RWGS reactor with intermediate separation of steam. In such a design, approximately the same amount of carbon dioxide is required at the input of the reactor, than incoming carbon dioxide normally available, conditioned that the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio on the output is near a value of 2. This additional amount of carbon dioxide is thus provided by a recycling loop of this reactor assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This additional supply of carbon dioxide is not consumed in the reactor, but circulates through it to change the equilibrium conditions for as near a complete conversion of the incoming carbon dioxide as possible. The two streams of carbon dioxide (fresh as well as recycled) can be mixed in a conventional gas mixer <b>366</b> or fed using separate, appropriately designed nozzles or distributors into the RWGS reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">The amount of carbon dioxide in the recycle loop depends on the amount of hydrogen feed, on the operating temperature of the RWGS reaction, and on the number of serially connected reactors with separation of steam between them. At lower hydrogen feed, or at lower temperatures, or with fewer reactors in series, there is a substantially larger amount of carbon dioxide in the recycle loop, and vice versa. One advantage of having a lesser amount of gas in the recycle loop is that there are lesser electric and heat losses needed to maintain gas circulation and separation.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">The output stream of the RWGS reactor <b>362</b> goes first through a steam condensation section <b>368</b>, and then through a carbon dioxide separator <b>372</b>. In one embodiment, the steam condensation section can include a condenser (heat exchanger) followed by a knockout drum. The condensed water from the separator <b>368</b> can be fed back to the electrolyser. Separated carbon dioxide is delivered to the input gas mixer <b>366</b>. A direct output of the carbon dioxide separator <b>372</b> is syngas with a H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio approximately as beneficially required by the FT reactor <b>322</b> for efficient conversion and, residual carbon dioxide, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">There are other well-known processes to convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide that can be used in the present invention without changing functionality of this apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0132">Operating pressure in the reactors can be in the range of 4-30 bar, 20-25 bar is preferred. GHSV-STP (Gas Hourly Space Velocity at Standard Temperature and Pressure) of 1,500-15,000, preferably 5,000-8,000.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0133">Steam is preferably separated at or near ambient temperature, which leads to high separation ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0134">Separation of carbon dioxide from the output can be accomplished by traditional and current methods. The currently prevalent methods include a variety of Amine absorption processes as well as carbonate processes, pressure swing absorption, adsorption, and gas permeation, among others. Additionally, cryogenic separation is possible by lowering the temperature, and increasing pressure under appropriate processing conditions, such that only 15-35% of carbon dioxide may be left in the syngas, as a ratio to carbon monoxide, mol/mol, for example, at &#x2212;50 to &#x2212;55&#xb0; C. and 50-100 bar pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0135">More likely, using cryogenics, solvent-mediated processes such as Ryan-Holmes, or three-phase ones such as CFZ (Controlled Freezing Zone), can be used for further reduction of carbon dioxide content. The residual carbon dioxide will be circulated through the upstream processes, or better yet beneficially consumed under certain operating conditions in the FT subassembly, and then more or less of it will be returned back to the input of this subassembly. Further, some of these processes can be used sequentially, for example, cryogenic liquefaction to separate the majority of carbon dioxide, followed by either CFZ or Amine absorption to condition syngas to a desired carbon dioxide level, in 3-10% level measured in mol/mol versus carbon monoxide. In front of the cryogenic-type of separator, water vapors must be thoroughly removed. Adsorption type dryers may be used as commonly practiced in cryogenic processes.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0136">Another preferable carbon dioxide conversion system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and comprises a three-stage RWGS. As shown, there are three steam separator sections, one after each reactor, and then a carbon dioxide separator at the end of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0137">The RWGS reaction is weak in the direction of formation of carbon monoxide and therefore requires removal of at least one reactant.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0138">In order to achieve as close to 100% conversion as possible, the system of the present invention <b>100</b> can use a three-stage RWGS reactor in conjunction with (i) steam removal on the output of each stage and (ii) increased molar concentration on the input.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139">First, the hydrogen molar concentration is increased to the extent that the resulting syngas will have up to the right ratio H<sub>2</sub>/CO for the upstream Fischer-Tropsch reactor <b>322</b>. In one example, this ratio is two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">To satisfy the RWGS reaction, the first RWGS reactor <b>382</b> in this embodiment is fed with a molar ratio of 3:1 in relation to input carbon dioxide <b>384</b> molar content. One mole is used to reduce carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, and two moles are left for effluent syngas.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0141">Next, the carbon dioxide input is increased to the first RWGS reactor <b>382</b> by creating a recycling line <b>386</b> from the output, and circulating it without conversion. Approximately one more mole needs to be added in the circulating loop to one mole of input carbon dioxide to create the approximately 100% conversion in three RWGS reactors <b>382</b>, <b>388</b>, <b>394</b> in series with the construction as presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0142">The carbon dioxide conversion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> relies on steam removal and carbon dioxide separation. A first steam separator <b>392</b> removes steam from effluent gas of the first RWGS reactor <b>382</b>, and by doing so, creates conditions to continue carbon dioxide conversion in the second RWGS reactor <b>388</b>. As carbon monoxide has not been removed, the conversion rate of the second reactor <b>388</b> will be smaller than the first reactor <b>382</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0143">A second steam separator <b>392</b> removes steam from effluent gas of the second RWGS reactor <b>388</b>, and by doing so, creates conditions to continue carbon dioxide conversion in the third RWGS reactor <b>394</b>. As carbon monoxide has not been removed, the conversion rate of the third reactor <b>394</b> will be smaller than the second reactor <b>388</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0144">A third steam separator <b>392</b> is positioned on the output of the third RWGS reactor <b>394</b>. On the output of this separator, effluent gas contains syngas of a desired CO/H<sub>2 </sub>ratio and carbon dioxide. Thus, carbon dioxide is separated using a separator <b>396</b>, and placed in recycling line <b>386</b> to combine in a gas mixer <b>398</b> with incoming carbon dioxide <b>384</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">If syngas contains smaller amount of hydrogen than necessary to feed upstream to the FT reactors, then additional hydrogen from electrolyser <b>410</b> will be added.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146">RWGS Reactors</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0147">The RWGS reactors used in the present system of the present invention <b>100</b> can operate efficiently at a number of operating temperatures, while 400&#xb0; C. is used in a preferred embodiment. An exemplary catalyst is KATALCO 71-5 produced by Johnson Matthey. Operating pressures can be in the range of 4-30 bar, with preference for higher values to reduce overall size of the assembly. A GHSV-STP of 1,500-15,000, preferably 5,000-8,000 is used.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0148">The reaction is endothermic and requires external heat. In a preferred embodiment, the system of the present invention <b>100</b> uses an isothermal operation (being within plus or minus 10% of the ideal operating temperature as measured in &#xb0; K.), with external heat delivered into a reaction zone from an external source. One example of an overall heat delivery system <b>810</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Phase conversion of a working fluid is used to deliver heat at or near isothermally, specifically the RWGS-line. RWGS-line vapors are delivered to condenser coil <b>812</b>. Vapors condense and release condensation heat, while maintaining phase conversion temperature. The residual working fluid is released into the liquid part of the RWGS-line. Released heat is consumed by reacting gases inside the reactor through a heat exchange process.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0149">Preferably, the reactors <b>382</b>, <b>388</b>, <b>394</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are of the same general construction, although the second and third reactors can be smaller as the first, as they convert lesser amounts of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and process smaller in volume gas mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">This RWGS subassembly can process not only pure carbon dioxide but also a mixture of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The mixture can be processed through one, two, or all three serially connected reactors, as a function of ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. If this ratio is smaller than this ratio on the output of the first reactor under condition of pure carbon dioxide conversion, then all three reactors will be used. The difference will be in reduced amount of hydrogen required for reduced amount of carbon dioxide. The same rule will determine if two or only one reactors are required for processing of this mixture. Ultimately, if only carbon monoxide is supplied, then no reactors are required.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0151">Alternatives&#x2014;Carbon Dioxide Conversion</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0152">As discussed, carbon dioxide conversion is preferably run through an RWGS process <b>360</b>. There are a number of modifications to this RWGS process that will not significantly change the outcome&#x2014;the production of carbon monoxide components of syngas.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0153">For example, the temperature of reaction in the reactors can be reduced. This will decrease the equilibrium constant, and will thus cause an increase in amount of carbon dioxide in the recycling line, or the number of reactors connected in series, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0154">Additionally, the temperature of reaction can be increased, and then it can be possible to reduce the number of reactors in a preferred embodiment from three, to two or only one with a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide circulation to provide 100% conversion of incoming carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0155">It is also possible to reduce amount of hydrogen gas fed to this process with consequent increase in carbon dioxide in the recycling loop. It is also possible to reduce the amount of circulating carbon dioxide by using more than three reactors in series at the same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0156">The reaction heat does not have to be delivered isothermally, but rather can be provided through heat exchange with any hot-side fluid of appropriate temperature, flow rate, among other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0157">Other processes are known to convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, and such processes can be used in the present system of the present invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0158">Carbon Monoxide Conversion</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0159">Carbon monoxide conversion is preferably run through an FT reactor process <b>320</b>. The reactor assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The operation of an FT reactor <b>322</b> is as follows:

<p id="p-0160" num="0161">In one preferred embodiment, as an example, the reactor operates with a Cobalt catalyst at 220&#xb0; C., and produces a mix of hydrocarbons, which after upgrading leads primarily to the production of a mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel in an approximate proportion of 1:2.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0162">In other implementations of the present invention, at higher temperatures, for example around 330-350&#xb0; C., more gasoline is produced, in gasoline to diesel ratio of approximately 4:1. So by combining operation at different temperatures, one can adjust gasoline to diesel ratio from 1:2 to 4:1. The production rate of diesel fuel by the present invention includes adjusting the temperature, pressure and residence time (gas flow). The amount of residual hydrocarbons that is difficult to convert into desired liquid fuels varies, and generally is higher at higher temperature and lower at low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0163">In one embodiment, a Cobalt catalyst is used, with a H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of 2.15, a 220&#xb0; C. operating temperature, a pressure of approximately 20 bar, and GHSV-STP of 1,500. The conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons is up to 75%. Pressure can change in the range of 10-30 bar and GHSV from 500 to 5,000.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0164">The FT reactor <b>322</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> produces both liquid hydrocarbons that are drained for further processing, and gaseous hydrocarbons mixed with steam and input gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The presence of input gases is due to incomplete conversion of syngas. For more complete conversion, more than one FT reactor can be used in series with removal of steam and certain hydrocarbon gases in between the reactors. In an example of a preferred embodiment, a two-stage FT reactor is used to achieve higher conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0165">On the output of the reactor <b>322</b>, steam is separated from the effluent gas by a steam separator <b>324</b>, then gaseous hydrocarbons with carbon numbers C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>by a separator <b>326</b>, and finally gaseous hydrocarbons with carbon numbers C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>by a separator <b>328</b>.

<p id="p-0165" num="0166">In a preferred embodiment, a majority of the syngas is returned to the input of the FT reactor <b>322</b> via a recycle line, thereby improving conversion efficiency of incoming syngas into hydrocarbon fuels.

This throttle is installed in the recycling line for effluent gas, and allows venting or flaring of a portion of this effluent gas in equal molar proportions. In a preferred embodiment, a controlling parameter is the amount of natural gas compounds before the vent. The throttle is open just enough to maintain this amount at a predetermined level.

The unconverted syngas, steam, residual carbon dioxide from the RWGS assembly, and all hydrocarbons produced in the reactor that are gaseous at the reaction temperature and pressure are fed into a steam separator <b>348</b>. It is preferred to make separation at ambient temperature, but other temperatures can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0172">At this position in the process, much smaller amounts of syngas are left than on the output of FT reactor <b>342</b>, and therefore the partial pressure of hydrocarbon gases with carbon number C<sub>5 </sub>and higher is larger, and they will condense along with steam in the steam and C<sub>5+</sub> separator <b>348</b>. C<sub>n </sub>is a hydrocarbon with n-number of carbon atoms per molecule. C<sub>n+</sub> means hydrocarbons with n or more carbon atoms per molecule. The condensed liquid is drained, and water is separated by many common processes, like distillation or gravimetrically in a water separator <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0173">The residual gases from the separator <b>348</b> are fed to another separator <b>354</b> of hydrocarbons, including ones with carbon numbers C<sub>3 </sub>and C<sub>4</sub>. They can be condensed and separated from this residual mixture at, for example, 20-50 bar, and at temperatures where most of such compounds are condensed. This temperature depends on amount of other gases in an effluent gas. When these amounts are large in comparison with volume of separateable gases, low temperature like one used for carbon dioxide separation can be used. Then, not only C<sub>3 </sub>and C<sub>n </sub>hydrocarbons can be separated but also carbon dioxide. These gases can be easily separated from each other by pressure change and carbon dioxide recycled to the input of the RWGS assembly. Effluent syngas, components of natural gas, and residual carbon dioxide are fed to a controllable relief <b>332</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In this relief, in equilibrium conditions, the amount of syngas is substantially smaller than other gases, and therefore whatever amount of mixture is released, it will contain much smaller amount of syngas than in the recycling loop. Presence of syngas in the recycling loop has the same effect on completion of conversion of the incoming syngas as presence of carbon dioxide in the recycling loop of the RWGS subassembly. Amount of syngas in vented gases can be used also for control of venting ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0174">In other preferred embodiments, more reactors can be used to increase the syngas conversion rate, even at different operating parameters, to create a more desirable spectrum of produced hydrocarbons, like one at low temperature like 220&#xb0; C. and another one at like 340&#xb0; C. Syngas can be directed in different amounts to reactors operating under different conditions to regulate composition of produced hydrocarbons that will in its turn affect composition of fuels after upgrading, i.e. relative amounts of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0175">FT Reactors</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0176">The reaction is highly exothermic and requires substantial heat removal as the output of the reactor is highly temperature dependent. In a preferred embodiment, phase conversion of water into steam in the FT-line is used to remove this heat, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. This leads to near isothermal operation of the reactor, and therefore consistent output, as the output of products from this reactor is highly dependent on temperature, for example within 10&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0177">Alternatives&#x2014;Carbon Monoxide Conversion</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">Carbon monoxide conversion may be accomplished through an FT process <b>320</b>. There are number of modifications to this FT process that will not change the outcome, i.e. the production of hydrocarbon compounds out of syngas, but may significantly change the composition of the products produced.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">For example, the temperature of the reactors can vary in the range of 150&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. Variances in catalyst type, catalyst bed type, pressure, residence time, and velocity of syngas, will alter in varying degrees the composition of the products produced. At higher temperatures, lighter hydrocarbon compositions are produced. In one example, at 310&#xb0;-340&#xb0; C., and utilizing a circulating catalyst, 72% of the output includes compositions with carbon number C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>11 </sub>on which gasoline is based, 6% heavier hydrocarbons, 8% hydrocarbon gases, and 14% of alcohols, ketones and acids.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0180">The FT assembly can be made to operate at different reactor temperatures by regulating water temperature and pressure in the FT-line, and pressure in the FT reactors and other components affect separation of steam and hydrocarbon gases.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">The type of catalyst and its bed can be also changed from time to time to match changes in operating characteristics. Two or more reactors can be used connected in series and operating at the same or different temperatures, catalysts, and other operating conditions. Also, there can be two or more parallel strings of reactors, also operating at different or same conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0185">A portion of an embodiment of electrolyser <b>410</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. It is preferred to use bipolar electrodes <b>412</b> for a high voltage and lower current stack of electrolytic cells. Electric current <b>414</b> flows through the surface of all bipolar electrodes into electrolyte <b>416</b>, which causes electrolysis of water in each cell.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0186">Each cell can be divided by a gas diaphragm <b>418</b>. Hydrogen and oxygen are released on opposite sides of each bipolar electrode, collected in the space between electrode and diaphragm, and vented out for uses in the system of the present invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0187">In a preferred embodiment, an electrolyser design with a high current density, for example 5-20 kA/m<sup>2</sup>, is used. In comparison with low current densities, for example, 1-3 kA/m<sup>2</sup>, such an increase leads to much smaller size, weight, and cost electrolysers. But there is a different energy efficiency at such an increased current density due to much larger overvoltage on electrodes and resistive losses in the electrolyte. High current density electrolysers use the following construction and operating parameters:

<p id="p-0187" num="0192">It is possible to achieve cell voltage around its thermoneutral (isothermal) voltage at some level of high current. It means that if with a supply of electric energy, this thermoneutral potential is reached, then no additional cooling or heating of cells will be required. If this potential will be lower, then additional heat will be required, and if higher&#x2014;then cooling will be required.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193">Reaction water to the cells of high current density electrolysers can be delivered in two ways, either traditionally as liquid, or by steam condensing into water right in the cell, or a combination of water and steam. The choice is design specific, as a function of current density, other auxiliary subsystem choice for the electrolyser, operating voltages, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194">Choice of high current density electrolysers leads to other efficiencies in the overall plant due to lower temperature and especially pressure differentials.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">The electrical feed of the electrolyser can use existing devices described herein. In a preferred embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the use of several rectifiers connected in series, each fed from phase shifting transformers. This circuit design leads to a high efficiency rectifier that converts AC (alternating current) voltage in the first EDL to DC (direct current)&#x2014;required for operation of electrolysers.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">The high voltage stack of the electrolyser can be divided into several stacks working in parallel for convenience of construction, maintenance, and safety. The same can be done with the rectifier. Semiconductor rectifiers can be paralleled to carry higher current, or each of such parallel rectifiers can be connected to a separate electrolyser stack. The same can be done with the transformers.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, three transformers are used, but these transformers do not have to have any phase shift, and can be used in many quantities. The high voltage electrolyser cell stacks can even be fed directly without any transformer if output voltage of the electric power plant is compatible with the stack required voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">The phase shifting transformers use more than one phase on the input with phase shifts between phases not 0&#xb0; or 180&#xb0;, but usually 120&#xb0; or 240&#xb0;, as common in three-phase electrical distribution. In an example, transformer <b>432</b> with three input phases is fed by the electric power distribution line (EDL). The phase relationship is shown on the vector diagram <b>434</b>. This is a typical delta phase arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">The output (secondary) winding of one phase of the three-phase transformer <b>432</b> comprises typically two separate windings connected in series. One winding <b>436</b> is wound over one input phase winding, and the other <b>438</b> is wound over another input phase winding. Phase of voltage in each secondary winding is in phase with the input voltage of the winding over which this secondary winding is wound.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">By selecting the ratio of number of turns, or transformer ratio, between these two windings and polarity, one can achieve many desired phase shifts. The diagram <b>442</b> shows a ratio in voltage transformation and a polarity of voltages transformed from its underlying input phase voltages of equal value and 120&#xb0; phase shift. The combined voltage in output phase XY is phase shifted in comparison with the input voltage in phase XY. In this example, it is lagging. The diagram <b>444</b> shows change of polarity on the output which makes this phase shift leading.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">Rectifier</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">The present system can utilize a semiconductor rectifier, being a typical three-phase rectifier. Instead of semiconductors, vacuum tube-based rectifiers that can rectify much larger current can also be used. Semiconductors can be paralleled using known circuits to achieve reasonable sharing of current in paralleled semiconductors. The rectifier can also be made for more phases by adding more phase legs and connecting all phases from all phase shifting transformers in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">Output Voltage</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">The phase shifting transformers and rectifiers described herein are combined into a circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, three rectifier circuits R are shown connected in series, each fed from phase shifting transformers T. This circuit leads to a rectified DC voltage with very slight pulsation of voltage, 1.5% peak-to-peak, which is beneficial for sizing of all components in the electrical circuits of the electrolyser. There are other ways to make connection, for example, through paralleling these three circuits. Another alternative is to use a different number of circuits, with more or less phases and corresponding lower or higher pulsation of output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">The resulting voltage is a sum of voltages from all three rectifiers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates, to scale, a voltage diagram <b>452</b> from one three-phase rectifier. For one period of the electric distribution line voltage (360&#xb0;), there are six rectified tops of sine waveform, from positive and negative halves of each phase. The depth of voltage pulsation is cos (30&#xb0;)=0.866, or 13.4% of the peak voltage value. In the circuit with three rectifiers, the phase shift is maintained between phases to be 20&#xb0; leading and lagging. In this case, the depth of voltage pulsations is cos (10&#xb0;)=0.985, or 1.5% of the peak value&#x2014;the voltage diagram <b>454</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">This pulsation is adequate for low current fluctuation in the electrolyser cells that, in turn, leads to higher utilization of the surfaces of the cells and lower power rating of transformers and rectifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207">The high voltage stack of the electrolyser can be divided into several stacks working in parallel for convenience of construction, maintenance and safety, among other issues. The same can be done with a rectifier. Semiconductor rectifiers can be paralleled to carry higher current, or each of such parallel rectifiers can be connected to a separate electrolyser stack. The same can be done with the transformers.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">Post-Processing</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">Typically, the output of the conversion step <b>300</b> is a spectrum of hydrocarbons. A post-processing step <b>500</b> is provided to upgrade the hydrocarbons to the desired mixture of fuels F. The process can use existing technologies to convert hydrocarbon streams from the FT subassembly into desired fuels, and other products if so desired. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows inputs in and outputs from such a facility. Typical upgraders will involve hydrocracking of FT heavy ends (in the lubes and wax range) to fuels primarily in the diesel and gasoline range. It should be noted that a refinery's need in hydrogen can be preferably satisfied with hydrogen from the electrolyser.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210">Burner-Generator</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0211">In a preferred embodiment, a burning system <b>520</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The inputs to the burner can be vented gases from the FT reactor assembly, and/or residues from the refinery, and/or natural gas compounds. All these compounds are burned in the gas turbine-generator <b>522</b> with a relatively small portion of oxygen coming from the electrolyser. The output gases from the turbine exhaust are steam and carbon dioxide. Steam is separated into water and residue&#x2014;carbon dioxide&#x2014;that is fed back to a gas mixer with incoming carbon dioxide. This is yet another gas recycling loop of the system of the present invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0212">Electric power produced by the generator is fed back to the electric power line and further to the electrolyser.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0213">As a result, there is little to no waste material coming out of the system, only the desired fuels and oxygen in the amount to combust them.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0214">As electric power produced is recycled back into production of hydrogen, this apparatus is less sensitive to incomplete conversion of syngas in the FT subassembly. Also, as carbon dioxide is recycled back to the input of the RWGS subassembly, this apparatus is less sensitive to separation efficiency of carbon dioxide separation in the RWGS subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0215">Gas Separation And Processing Generally</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0216">In the presented processes, there are numerous places where certain gases must be separated from a gas mixture, or simply gas parameters, for example, temperature and pressure, must be adjusted to make it compatible with an upstream process.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0217">One advantage of the present system is its energy efficient gas processing. There are basically two energy efficient thermodynamic processes used for gas processing. The first one is an adiabatic process when all external work is converted to or from gas energy. The second one is an isothermal process, when all external work is either converted into heat or derived from heat.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0218">It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that these are ideal processes. In practical applications, there are some temperature variations in an ideally isothermal process. These variations make the process near isothermal. As used herein, the term &#x201c;isothermal&#x201d; shall include an operation or process that is &#x201c;near&#x201d;, &#x201c;approximate&#x201d; or other such terms to modify the ideal isothermal operation, and more specifically relates to a change in absolute temperature measured in &#xb0; K. in a practical isothermal process in a range of plus and minus 10% from an ideal isothermal temperature. Similarly, in practical adiabatic processes, some heat energy is involved in addition to the mainly external work performed. Such &#x201c;practical&#x201d; adiabatic processes are similarly &#x201c;near&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; adiabatic, and when involved heat energy is also in a range of plus and minus 10% of the amount of external work energy from the ideal process.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0219">The present invention preferably includes one or more units for changing the pressure of a gas &#x201c;isothermally&#x201d;, which incorporates a range of plus and minus 10% from the ideal isothermal process temperature. The present invention preferably includes one or more units for changing the temperature of a gas &#x201c;adiabatically&#x201d;, which incorporates a range of plus and minus 10% from the ideal adiabatic process, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0220">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a diagram of a universal gas separation using these two processes is presented. First, three processes <b>610</b> through <b>614</b> condition a gas mixture for separation of one or more of its components by condensation in the condenser <b>616</b>. Then, three processes <b>618</b> through <b>622</b> condition the residual gas mixture for further processing. The separated gas or gases is in liquid phase in the condenser <b>616</b>. If it is desired for further processing in a gaseous phase, then some gases are evaporated in the evaporator <b>624</b>, and then are conditioned for further processing by processes <b>626</b> through <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0221">Each group of processes, either <b>610</b> through <b>614</b>, or <b>618</b> through <b>620</b>, or <b>626</b> through <b>630</b>, are identical in their principal functioning. They are centered on conditioning of gases for adiabatic processing to avoid any gas mixture component from changing phase, either to liquid or solid. Each process begins with adjusting pressure isothermally. Next, the gas or mixture of gasses is processed adiabatically to change temperature. After this process, the final isothermal process changes pressure as required for further processing. In summary, pressure is changed isothermally, and temperature adiabatically.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0222"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows adiabatic machines, one to increase temperature and pressure by compression using power from an electric distribution line, and one to decrease temperature and pressure and generating power to that line. In a preferred embodiment, an electric power line is used as both a source and the recipient of power delivered to or derived from adiabatic processes. The compressor <b>632</b> is preferred to be a turbine driven by an electric motor, and the expander <b>634</b> is also preferred to be a turbine driving an electric power generator. Such generator must be synchronized to the frequency and phase of voltage in the electric power line and to match that voltage value, very similar to other generators used in electric power grid. Other types of compressors and expanders beside turbine type can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows isothermal machines, one to increase pressure and one to decrease it. In the machine to increase pressure, a compressor <b>636</b> driven by electric motor is used, and the resulting gas mixture receiving power from the electric power line is both compressed and cooled. The heat is removed by a cooler <b>638</b>. The amount of heat removed is equal, theoretically, to the electric energy delivered from the electric power line. For large changes in pressure, several serially-connected isothermal pressure changers can be used. In this case, they are called interleaved compressors. They are interleaved with coolers.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0224">The opposite process is used for reducing pressure isothermally. In this case, the gas mixture is expanded and this reduces both, its pressure and temperature. Change in temperature is compensated by heating. Again, the amount of heat delivered to the mixture is equal, theoretically, to the amount of energy delivered to an electric power line by the electric generator driven by an expander <b>640</b>. It is preferred to use turbines as both, compressors and expanders, but other types can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0225">The system uses coolers <b>638</b> and heaters <b>642</b> in the isothermal machines. These are, in essence, heat exchangers. For isothermal operation, it is preferred to use phase conversion of a working fluid to deliver or remove heat to and from gases passing through these heat exchangers. This enables the system to process heat with near zero change in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0226">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, several examples of energy distribution lines used in the present invention are shown. A first is an electric power line that delivers power to all uses&#x2014;the electrolyser and all electric motors&#x2014;and receives power from all sources&#x2014;the electric power plant and all internal electric power generators.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0227">Other lines are heat distribution lines. They deliver heat or accept heat from various sources and uses of heat. Each line preferably includes two parts, a liquid part and a vapor part. When heat must be delivered from a line, then vapors are taken into a heat exchanger dedicated to accept this heat, condense in this heat exchanger and release heat, and condensed liquid is delivered in the other half of a heat distribution line. When heat must be accepted, the reverse process is used, liquid is evaporated into vapors.</p>

<p id="p-0241" num="0246">The other line on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is the carbon dioxide separation line. All heaters and coolers shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, that are used in isothermal pressure changes of incoming and outflowing gases at a temperature close to carbon dioxide separation by liquefaction, use or deliver heat from or to this line. All evaporators and condensers shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> for carbon dioxide separation are either getting heat from this line or deliver heat to this line. The carbon dioxide separation line is used not only for separation of carbon dioxide from effluent gas on the output of the RWGS reactor, but also for separation of C<sub>3 </sub>and C<sub>4 </sub>hydrocarbons and residual carbon dioxide in the effluent gas of the FT reactor. There is also an excess heat collecting end of a heat pump taking excess heat from the carbon dioxide separation line into the ambient line.</p>

<p id="p-0263" num="0268">On <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, we show processing of water to feed the electrolyser. Water is coming from multiple sources. It is preferred to recycle as much water from the other processes in this plant, specifically from the RWGS reactors steam separators, from the FT reactors steam separators, from the burner-generator steam separator, and any water collected in refining. All these streams of water and incoming water are at different temperatures, most of them around ambient temperature, but the electrolyser water is at 130-150&#xb0; C. and compressed to 20-30 bar.

The essential purpose of control of the RWGS assembly is to substantially as possible convert incoming carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using feedback control.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0280">Flow of incoming carbon dioxide is controlled via a throttling device <b>1502</b> having a regulating element driven by the power driver <b>1504</b>.

Outputs of both meters are fed to inputs of an error amplifier <b>1512</b> as shown, and those inputs are calibrated in molar velocity. The output of this amplifier drives power driver <b>1504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0281">If amount of carbon monoxide becomes smaller than carbon dioxide, the error amplifier output reduces drive of the throttle and less carbon dioxide flows making difference between both flows smaller, with error bandwidth of this negative feedback loop.</p>

The essential purpose of the control of the FT assembly is to maintain certain levels of hydrocarbon or other gases like syngas on the output of the assembly, with the ultimate purpose of minimizing discharge of syngas out of the FT assembly recycling loop.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0283">A control gas flow meter <b>1522</b> on the output of the FT subassembly is located prior to the splitter <b>322</b>.

<p id="p-0280" num="0285">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is shown the control of hydrogen supply to the RWGS subassembly. The essential purpose of this control is to supply enough hydrogen for the desired H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio on the output of the RWGS subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0286">Flow of incoming carbon dioxide is measured by the same flow meter <b>1506</b>. There is another flow meter <b>1544</b> of hydrogen. Output of carbon dioxide flow meter is fed into a multiplier <b>1546</b> that multiplies signal by the desired ratio of hydrogen versus carbon dioxide on the input of the RWGS subassembly.

<p id="p-0284" num="0289">Carbon monoxide flow is measured by a flow meter <b>1562</b> and hydrogen flow is measured by a meter <b>1564</b>. Both meters are calibrated in molar velocity. A signal from meter <b>1562</b> is fed to a multiplier <b>1566</b> where the multiplier coefficient represents the desired ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide on the output. In a preferred embodiment, it is approximately two, similar to the ratio on the input of the FT subassembly, and varies as a function of operating conditions of a specific type of the FT reactor hereby described.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0290">Outputs of the multiplier <b>1566</b> and the flow meter <b>1564</b> are fed to an error amplifier <b>1568</b>.

<p id="p-0286" num="0291">This is a negative feedback loop.

<p id="p-0291" num="0296">In Table 1, the calculations are shown for two species of carbon oxides. For each species, all values as explained in the following exemplary description and leading to minimum efficiency are combined in one column, and all values leading to maximum efficiency in another. Efficiency is defined as a ratio of the high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds (HHV) to the total electric energy supplied to the process and the plant from an external source (TEE). Electric energy use is defined as a reciprocal value of efficiency, as TEE over HHV.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0297">In the last line of Table <b>1</b>, an excess or deficit of electric energy is shown. For example, in a case of using carbon dioxide as an input and having minimum efficiency, 40% more electric energy will be required than the high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds produced. In a case of using carbon dioxide as an input and having maximum efficiency, only 10% more electric energy required.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0298">In case of carbon monoxide as an input, it is evident that substantially less electric energy will be required, as carbon monoxide has certain combustion energy (versus carbon dioxide having none). For this reason, in case of carbon monoxide as an input and having minimum efficiency, 16% less electric energy will be required than the high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds produced. In a case of using carbon monoxide as an input and having maximum efficiency, 36% less.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0299">The following is a description of the entries of Table 1, wherein for simplicity, all energies are shown per one carbon dioxide mole converted into hydrocarbon compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0300">Electric energy required for electrolysis of water is between 274 and 286 kJ per mole of hydrogen, as a function of temperature and under current density providing isothermal operation. In the preferred embodiment, it is estimated that this will be 275 kJ. 3.1 moles of hydrogen are required to recycle one mole of carbon dioxide, thus, 853 kJ of electricity will be required, which is for isothermal operation. For lower current densities, this amount of electric energy will be lower, for an example of up to 100 kJ lower. In such a case, this deficiency will be supplied from the other processes in this plant. Naturally, for higher current densities, there will be a need for more electric energy and additional heat must be removed. Some of this heat can be recycled into feeding an electrolyser electrically via electric power generation. Naturally, all heat can't be recovered and total energy consumption will increase.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0301">The RWGS reaction is moderately endothermic and requires 37-41 kJ per mole of converted carbon dioxide, as a function of operating conditions. This is another process that can use heat produced in this plant.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0302">The Fischer-Tropsch reaction is highly exothermic and produces 146-176 kJ per carbon monoxide mole converted. This reaction is a major source of heat in this plant, methods and systems.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0303">Other energy needs comes from energy dissipated in the processes that are difficult to recover like losses in bearings, electric motors, transformers, rectifiers, radiation and convection losses, and the like, and from the difference in enthalpy of incoming and outflowing products. It is important to note that it is only losses in reversible processing of gases and liquids that count due to processing per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. For this reason, it is estimated that these losses are in the range of 150-200 kJ per mole of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0304">Output from the FT reactors is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds with different combustion energies. For this estimate, the high heating value of combustion is used as water is used for recycling. In a mixture of compounds, this energy is on the order of approximately 670-680 kJ per one converted carbon dioxide mole.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0305">Using all these values, the amount of input electric energy is calculated per amount of high heating value of combustion of hydrocarbon compounds produced using that electric energy in the process and system hereby described. This range is between 1.4 and 1.1 when only carbon dioxide is used on the input. In turn, this means that the system needs between 10 to 40% more electric energy from an external source than is contained in high heating value of combustion energy of hydrocarbon compounds with end products carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0306">This energy usage is favorably comparable with the energy usage of coal to liquid conversion&#x2014;in the range of 2.5&#x2014;and gas-to-liquid (GTL) energy usage in the range of 1.7. In both cases, the input is high heating value of either coal or gas.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0307">In the present system, there is a much lower usage of electric energy when carbon monoxide is used from an external source, versus using carbon dioxide. In this case, the system will need one mole less of hydrogen, and no heat for the reverse water gas shift reactors. Then energy required for water electrolysis will be in the range of 275 kJ/mol, times 2.1 moles, for 578 kJ. In addition, the amount of losses in gas processing will be reduced at least by one-third due to elimination of the RWGS process and carbon dioxide separation process, so it will be 100 to 130 kJ. This results in that external electric energy needs are between 0.64 and 0.84 of high heating value of hydrocarbon compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0308">To achieve such beneficially low usage of externally supplied electricity, the following major internal energy flows are implemented:</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0309">From Fischer-Tropsch to RWGS, using heat pump;</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0310">From Fischer-Tropsch to the electrolyser, as condensation heat of steam, if required;</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0311">From Fischer-Tropsch to all process heat uses;</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0312">From Fischer-Tropsch to the electrolyser, using residual heat for electric power generation;</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0313">From internal gas expanders-generators to internal compressor-motors; and</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0314">From internal gas/liquid coolers to internal gas/liquid heaters using phase conversion of working fluids</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0315">Systems-Wide Preferred Alternatives</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0316">In addition to using the FT reactor(s) to convert syngas into liquid fuels, it can be desirable to produce major components of natural gas, methane. This can be accomplished using a catalysed reaction

<p id="p-0312" num="0317">In addition, other various hydrocarbon substances can be produced from such syngas, as commonly known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0318">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a plant can be located in proximity to natural gas fields, to take carbon dioxide, and deliver CH<sub>4</sub>. In many gas wells, there is substantial amount of carbon dioxide, perhaps and some of them are closed for that reason. The RWGS and FT processes disclosed can in some instance be bypassed, using a Sabatier reaction:

</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0319">In this process, similar amounts of heat are released as in the FT process (per carbon oxide mole) and conversion takes place at approximately 300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0320">Two different reactions can be used replacing the disclosed FT and RWGS processes. The first is the Lurgi process, also known as the Carnol process, can be used. The second is the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0321">While in the reverse water gas shift reaction, carbon dioxide is reacted with hydrogen to produce carbon monoxide and water, the Lurgi or Camol process uses the same reactants as the reverse water gas shift reaction with different catalysts and reaction conditions to produce methanol. Thus, in another embodiment of the present invention, the RWGS reaction can be substituted for the Lurgi or Carnol process, being:

</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0322">The methanol produced from this reaction is then used in the MTG process with high selectivity for light hydrocarbons forming basis of gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0323">While the invention has been disclosed in its preferred forms, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, additions, and deletions can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and its equivalents as set forth in the following claims.</p>
