<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical element holder and an optical communication module to which an optical element is mounted using the optical element holder.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, high-speed and large-capacity optical communication systems have further been advanced. Therefore, optical communication modules such as semiconductor laser modules and light-receiving modules used for the optical communication systems are required to have a higher reliability. In order to achieve the high reliability, generally and widely used is a method in which the optical elements constituting the optical communication module, such as an optical lens and an optical fiber, are fixed by a laser welding (YAG welding).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical communication module <b>80</b> disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 63-219186, comprises a laser element <b>81</b>, a lens <b>82</b>, a U-shape holder <b>90</b>, an optical isolator <b>83</b>, an element carrier <b>84</b>, a Peltier element <b>85</b>, a lens <b>86</b>, a ferrule <b>87</b>, an optical fiber <b>88</b>, a package <b>89</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inside the package <b>89</b>, the element carrier <b>84</b> is mounted through the Peltier element <b>85</b>. On the element carrier <b>84</b>, the laser element <b>81</b>, the lens <b>82</b> and the optical isolator <b>83</b> are mounted and laser light outputted from the laser element <b>81</b> is coupled to the optical fiber <b>88</b>. The optical fiber <b>88</b> is held by the ferrule <b>87</b> and the lens <b>86</b> is attached on the input side of the optical fiber <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Signal light is outputted from the laser element <b>81</b> and the signal light is guided to the optical isolator <b>83</b> through the lens <b>82</b>. The signal light permeated through the optical isolator <b>83</b> enters into the optical fiber <b>88</b> through the lens <b>86</b>. In this case, the return light from the optical fiber <b>88</b> is hindered by the optical isolator <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to compose the optical module, first, weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a </i>of the U-shape holder <b>90</b> are laser-welded to the element carrier <b>84</b>. Then, weld parts <b>96</b><i>a</i>, <b>97</b><i>a</i>, which are provided in a frame of the lens <b>82</b>, are laser-welded to the U-shape holder <b>90</b>. At last, weld parts <b>98</b><i>a</i>, <b>99</b><i>a </i>of the optical isolator <b>83</b> are laser-welded to the element carrier <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, a specific example of the conventional U-shape holder <b>90</b> will be described. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-5876 and the like disclose examples of the U-shape holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the conventional U-shape holder <b>90</b>, a pair of opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are provided being projected on the surface side of a plate-type pedestal <b>91</b> so as to hold the lens <b>82</b> by the inner side of the two opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>. At the same time, the weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a </i>provided on the outer side of the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are laser-welded to the element carrier (element carrier <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this case, the U-shape holder <b>90</b> is mounted on the element carrier <b>84</b> while the lens <b>82</b> is being inserted between the opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>of the holder <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Then, in the state where the lens <b>82</b> is disposed in front of the laser element <b>81</b>, the position of the holder <b>90</b> is adjusted in the X-axis direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> while making the laser element <b>81</b> emit the light so as to adjust the position of the lens <b>82</b> in the optimum position in the X direction. In this state, the weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a </i>of the holder <b>90</b> are laser-welded to the element carrier <b>84</b> so as to fix the position of the lens <b>82</b> in the X direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the lens <b>82</b> is moved in the vertical direction (Y direction) between the opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>so as to adjust the lens <b>82</b> to be in the optimum position in the Y direction. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the lens <b>82</b> is moved in the back-to-front direction (Z direction) along the optical axis direction of the lens <b>82</b> between the opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>so as to adjust the lens <b>82</b> to be in the optimum position in the Z direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At the point where these adjustments of the positions are completed, the frame (not shown) supporting the lens <b>82</b> is laser-welded to the holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, there are following shortcomings in the conventional U-shape holder <b>90</b>. The shortcomings are emphasized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and they are to be described by referring thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bottom ends of the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>of the holder <b>90</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>84</b>, thereby forming the weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a </i>between the bottom ends of the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>and the element carrier <b>84</b>. In these weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a</i>, a welding stress as shown by an arrow is generated when being shrunk after the welding. The welding stress is generated when the inner structures of the holder <b>90</b> and the element carrier <b>84</b> are pulled towards the weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>, <b>95</b><i>a </i>sides. In this case, the mass of the element carrier <b>84</b> is sufficiently large as compared to that of the holder <b>90</b> so that it is hard to be affected by the welding stress. On the other hand, the holder <b>90</b> is formed in a forked shape. Therefore, when there is the welding stress generated in the bottom ends of the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the opposing holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are deformed curving towards the outer side being away from each other due to the welding stress.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When adjusting the lens <b>82</b> to be in the optimum position in the Y direction and Z direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and FIG. <b>3</b>B, the two holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>as the reference are deformed by the welding stress as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, it is impossible to adjust the lens <b>82</b> to be in the optimum position in the Y direction and Z direction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, when the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are deformed by receiving the welding stress, the top ends of the two holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are deformed in the expanding direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> since they are formed in a forked shape.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When a frame <b>82</b><i>a </i>for supporting the lens <b>82</b> is welded to the two holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, a clearance <b>96</b> is formed between the frame <b>82</b><i>a </i>and the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>. Due to the clearance <b>96</b>, when welding the frame <b>82</b><i>a </i>for supporting the lens <b>82</b> to the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, weld part <b>97</b><i>b </i>for welding therewith is formed inside the clearances <b>96</b>. Thus, the frame <b>82</b><i>a </i>cannot be successfully welded to the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, which causes a trouble when determining the position of the lens <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-5876, the two holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are curved to be in a convex shape towards the inner side, respectively. The frame of the lens is pinched between the two curved holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>to be welded. Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-5876, as shown by an alternate long and short dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, projection parts <b>100</b> are projected in the lateral direction being away from the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-5876, the reason for projecting the projection parts <b>100</b>, <b>100</b> in the lateral direction may be as follows. That is, weld parts <b>94</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>95</b><i>a&#x2032;</i> for welding the projection parts <b>100</b> to the element carrier <b>84</b> are brought away from the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>as much as possible by separating the projection parts <b>100</b>, <b>100</b> away from the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>so as to minimize the welding stress affected on the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, which is generated when welding the projection parts <b>100</b> to the element carrier <b>84</b>. It is true that the affect of the welding stress is minimized through the configuration in which the above-described projection parts <b>100</b> are provided. However, in order to minimize the affect of the welding stress as much as possible, the forming positions of the projection parts <b>100</b> with respect to the holding sections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>are required to be separated away as much as possible. With the configuration, the external dimension of the U-shape holder <b>90</b>, especially the dimension in the lateral direction, is expanded so that the area occupied for disposing the holder <b>90</b> becomes large. Thus, it becomes impossible to meet the demand for reducing the dimension of the optical communication module using the holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An object of the present invention is to provide an optical element holder in which deformation due to the welding stress can be suppressed without expanding the dimension of the holder for holding a lens and the like, and an optical communication module to which an optical element is mounted using the optical element holder.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to achieve the foregoing object, the optical element holder according to the present invention comprises a pedestal having a pair of fixing sections, a pair of holding sections and a stress-suppressing section. The fixing sections are formed in opposing end portions of the pedestal for being welded to a carrier. The pair of holding sections are formed to face the pedestal in an inner position than positions where the fixing sections are formed so as to hold an optical element by pinching it therebetween. The stress-suppressing section is for preventing a welding stress, which is generated when the fixing sections are welded to the carrier, from affecting the holding sections.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, the fixing sections are formed on the pedestal on the outer side and the holding sections are formed on the inner side of the fixing sections, respectively. Further, the stress-suppressing sections are disposed between the fixing sections on the outer side and the holding sections on the inner side.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, due to the stress-suppressing sections, the welding stress, which is generated when welding the fixing sections to the carrier, can be prevented from affecting the holding sections. Accordingly, deformation of the holding sections due to the welding stress can be suppressed as much as possible. Further, the stress-suppressing sections are disposed between the fixing sections on the outer side and the holding sections on the inner side so that the length of the fixing sections being projected from the pedestal can be shortened. Thus, the dimension of the optical element holder in the lateral direction can be minimized as much as possible. As a result, the occupied area necessary to dispose the optical element holder of the present invention can be reduced so that it becomes possible to reduce the dimension of the optical communication module to which the optical element holder is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, as for the stress-suppressing section, it may be in either one of the configurations in which the stress-suppressing sections are formed between the fixing sections and the holding sections or the stressing-suppressing section is formed by being bridged over the pair of holding sections.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in the present invention, the stress-suppressing section may be formed by notches being cut from the surface side to the inside formed along the width direction of the holding sections.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described, with the present invention, it is possible to avoid the affect of the welding stress through utilizing a simple configuration with notches so that the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this case, the notch as the stress-suppressing section is formed on the surface side of the pedestal where the holding section is formed. Also, it may be formed on an opposite-side surface of the pedestal where the holding section is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One or a plurality of the notches as the stress-suppressing sections may be formed. Also, the plurality of notches may be closely formed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described, the surface of the pedestal for providing the notch is selected and the number of the notches is determined as appropriate. Thus, it is possible to suppress the deformation of the holding sections as much as possible by appropriately dealing with the welding stress.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above-described case, it has been described by referring to the stress-suppressing sections which are formed by the notches. However, it is not limited to this. For example, the stress-suppressing section may be formed over the pair of holding sections. The stress-suppressing section, which is formed over the pair of holding sections, may be formed by being bridged between the end portions of the holding sections.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The stress-suppressing section of this case forms a well-curb structure along with the pedestal and the pair of holding sections. Thus, it enables to increase the rigidity against the welding stress.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, it is possible to mount the optical element holder according to the present invention to an optical communication module. The optical communication module to which the optical element holder according to the present invention is mounted comprises: a light-emitting element for emitting a light beam; an optical fiber coupled to the light beam outputted from the light-emitting element; and a lens for guiding the light beam outputted from the light-emitting clement to the optical fiber. The lens is held by an optical element holder and the optical communication module is formed to have a configuration in which the above-described optical element holder is used as the optical element holder.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Even though an optical isolator for hindering the return light from the optical fibers is provided, it is possible to obtain a compact optical communication module. Further, it is possible to mount the optical amplifier and the optical isolator to the optical module regardless of the dimension of the optical element holder. Therefore, the properties of these equipments is utilized for improving the property of the optical communication module.</p>

The fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are formed in the end portions of the pedestal <b>11</b> to be welded to a carrier <b>16</b>. The pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed by facing against the pedestal <b>11</b> in the inner position than the forming position of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>so as to hold an optical element <b>13</b> by pinching it therebetween. Further, the stress-suppressing sections are for preventing the welding stress, which is generated when welding the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>to the carrier <b>16</b>, from affecting the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention proposes at least two types of configurations for the stress-suppressing sections.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b> and are formed in the opposing end portions of the pedestal <b>11</b> by projecting towards the lateral direction being away from each other. The top-end portions of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>, thereby forming weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>between the element carrier <b>16</b> and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> only shows the state where the weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>are formed between one of the fixing sections, <b>17</b><i>a</i>, and the element carrier <b>16</b>. However, the weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>are also formed between the other fixing section <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the element carrier <b>16</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed being stood up on the pedestal <b>11</b> in the inner position than that of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b</i>. The holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed in a plate-shape being stood up from the surface of the pedestal <b>11</b> in parallel by facing each other in a forked shape. The pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>support the optical element <b>13</b> by the opposing inner surfaces. The optical element <b>13</b> is inserted between the pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>for determining the optimum position of the optical element <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the optical element <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an optical amplifier <b>131</b> is used. The optical amplifier <b>131</b> is die-bonded on a frame <b>132</b> by a solder such as AuSn. As for the optical element <b>13</b>, it is not limited to the optical amplifier <b>131</b> but also the optical elements such as an optical lens and an optical isolator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As for the material for forming the frame <b>132</b> for supporting the optical amplifier <b>131</b>, the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the pedestal <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the element carrier <b>16</b>, used is a material such as Fe&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Co alloy, which is suitable for laser welding. Further, these are welded by, for example, using YAG laser, however, it is not limited to the laser welding using YAG laser.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The optical positioning of the optical element <b>13</b> using the optical element holder <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be specifically described. The position of the optical element <b>13</b> on the element carrier <b>16</b> in the X direction is adjusted by moving the optical element holder <b>10</b> on the element carrier <b>16</b> while pinching the optical element <b>13</b> in between the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The position of the optical element <b>13</b> on the element carrier <b>16</b> in the Y direction is adjusted by guiding and moving the optical element <b>13</b> in the vertical direction in the inner surfaces of the opposing two holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are used as the stress-suppressing sections. The notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are disposed between the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed on the surfaces of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>on the side where the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed along the width direction of the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>to be the notches in a concave shape which are cut towards the inner side from the surface. Further, these notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed in a single-line form towards the width direction of the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the effect of suppressing the welding stress in the optical element holder <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be described. The optical element <b>13</b> is held by the inner sides of the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>provided in the pedestal <b>11</b>. The pedestal <b>11</b> is mounted on the element carrier <b>16</b> for determining the position, and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the pedestal <b>11</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>. Thereby, the optical element holder <b>10</b> is fixed to the element carrier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>, the weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>as shown by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> are formed between the top-end portions of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the element carrier <b>16</b> to be welded. When the weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>shrink, the welding stress shown by an arrow is generated in the inner structures of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> and the element carrier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in the present invention, there are the notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>provided between the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Also, these notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed on the surface side of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>where the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are provided. Further, these notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed by being cut into the inner side of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>from the surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the welding stress due to welding is generated inside the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>,<b>17</b><i>b</i>, the welding stress generated inside the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>to affect the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>is shuttered for the depth of the notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the welding stress generated inside the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>to affect the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>becomes small as a whole. As a result, the welding stress affecting the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>through the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>becomes insufficient to deform the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are not to be deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, the notches <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>for suppressing the welding stress are disposed between the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>so that, as compared to the overhang amount of the fixing sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the overhang amount can be suppressed to minimum. Thus, the dimension of the optical element holder <b>10</b> in the lateral direction can be shortened as much as possible by suppressing the overhang amount of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>to minimum. Accordingly, it enables to reduce the area occupied for disposing the optical element holder <b>10</b> in which the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are provided as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After adjusting the position of the optical element holder <b>10</b> in the X direction and mounting it to the element carrier <b>16</b> by welding as described, the position of the frame <b>132</b> of the optical element <b>13</b> in the Y direction and Z direction is adjusted so as to set the optical amplifier <b>131</b> in the optimum position. Thereby, the frame <b>132</b> is laser-welded to the optical element holder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, another embodiment of the stress-suppressing sections according to the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The stress-suppressing sections according to the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> are formed by notches <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>.

The notches <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>are provided by utilizing the fact that the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are provided on the opposite-side surfaces of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>where the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are provided.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the welding stress generated when the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b> is reduced for the depth of the notches <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, the notches <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>are formed closely to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>so that the welding stress affecting the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>through the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>can be eased as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The notches <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>as the stress-suppressing sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> can suppress the deformation of the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>caused by the welding stress as in the same manner as the stress-suppressing sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Further, the forming position is close to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>so that the overhang amount of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>from the pedestal <b>11</b> can be extremely shortened. Thus, the dimension of the optical element holder <b>10</b> in the lateral direction can be reduced.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Notches <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>as the stress-suppressing sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> are formed in V-shape towards the inside of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>from the surface side. A plurality of lines of notches are arranged along the width direction of the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Each line of notches <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>is closely arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The notches <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>as the stress-suppressing sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> are formed in V-shape towards the inside of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>from the surface side so that the amount of cut into the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>can be suppressed to be relatively small. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the deterioration of the strength of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>caused by providing the notches <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Further, by increasing the number of lines of the notches <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>to be provided, the extent of suppressing the welding stress is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The stress-suppressing sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> are formed by being bridged over the pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. That is, a crossbeam-type connecting section <b>26</b> is used as the stress-suppressing section and the connecting section <b>26</b> is bridged over the end portions of the pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Thereby, the pair of holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed in a well-curb form as a whole together with the pedestal <b>11</b> and the connecting section <b>26</b>, in which the pedestal <b>11</b> and the connecting section <b>26</b> are bridged between the end portions on the top and bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, the stress-suppressing section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> has a configuration which is resistant to the welding stress affected from the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Thus, it is possible to protect the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>from the welding stress generated inside the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>in the same manner as the above-described embodiment. Further, compared to the embodiment in which the stress-suppressing sections are provided in the fixing sections, the higher strength of the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, described is a case of constituting an optical communication module in which the optical element is held by using the optical element holder <b>10</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Basically, an optical communication module <b>30</b> of the embodiment comprises: a laser element <b>81</b> for outputting signal light; an optical amplifier <b>131</b> for amplifying the signal light outputted from the laser element <b>81</b>; the element carrier <b>16</b> for fixing the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> in which the optical axes are adjusted to each other; the optical element holder <b>10</b> for fixing the optical amplifier <b>131</b> to the element carrier <b>16</b>; a package <b>31</b> for enclosing the laser element <b>81</b>, the optical amplifier <b>131</b>, the element carrier <b>16</b> and the optical element holder <b>10</b>; and an optical fiber <b>88</b> for guiding the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier <b>131</b> to the outside of the package <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, in the optical communication module <b>30</b>, lenses <b>82</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>86</b>, U-shape holders <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, an optical isolator <b>83</b>, a Peltier element <b>37</b>, a ferrule <b>87</b> and the like are provided. The lens <b>82</b> guides the signal light outputted from the laser element <b>81</b> to the optical isolator <b>83</b>. The optical isolator <b>83</b> prevents the return light to the laser element <b>81</b>. The lens <b>32</b> concentrates the signal light from the optical isolator <b>83</b> onto the optical amplifier <b>131</b>. The lens <b>33</b> concentrates the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier <b>131</b> to the optical fiber <b>88</b>. The Peltier element <b>37</b> keeps the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> at a constant temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The element carrier <b>16</b> is placed inside the package <b>31</b> by a support of the Peltier element <b>37</b>. One optical element holder <b>10</b> is disposed between the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical isolator <b>83</b> and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>. The weld parts are shown as the weld parts <b>43</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>a</i>. Further, a frame for supporting the lens <b>82</b> is welded to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b>. The weld parts are shown as weld parts <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Another optical element holder <b>10</b> is disposed between the optical isolator <b>83</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>. The weld parts are shown as weld parts <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>a</i>. A frame for supporting the lens <b>32</b> is welded to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b>. The weld parts are shown as weld parts <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Still another optical element holder <b>10</b> is disposed between the optical amplifier <b>131</b> and the lens <b>86</b> and the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b> are welded to the element carrier <b>16</b>. The weld parts are shown as weld parts <b>55</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>. A frame for supporting the lens <b>33</b> is welded to the holding sections <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the optical element holder <b>10</b>. The weld parts are shows as weld parts <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the opposite side which is in the position not to be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, weld parts <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>to <b>56</b><i>b </i>are formed symmetrically with weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>a </i>to <b>56</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, some weld parts which are in the position not to be seen are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Conventionally, it is extremely difficult to enclose the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> in one package <b>31</b> since the optical positioning of the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> is difficult to be performed. The reason is as follows. The laser welding is required for determining the positions with a high precision, however, the conventional U-shape holder is deformed by the stress at the time of welding even by the laser welding. Therefore, in the embodiment, the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> are positioned with high precision using the optical element holder <b>10</b> which is not easily deformed at the time of welding. Thereby, the optical communication module <b>30</b> in which the laser element <b>81</b> and the optical amplifier <b>131</b> are enclosed in one package <b>31</b> is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the manner of composing the optical communication module <b>30</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In order to make the diffused light emitted from the laser element <b>81</b> be collimated light, the lens <b>82</b> is adjusted in the X-axis direction, Y-axis direction and Z-axis direction while driving the laser element <b>81</b>, and the lens <b>82</b> is fixed to the element carrier <b>16</b> by YAG laser welding. The optical isolator <b>83</b> is disposed in almost the center of the collimated light so that the collimated light from the lens <b>82</b> passes through the optical isolator <b>83</b>, and the optical isolator <b>83</b> is fixed to the element carrier <b>16</b> by YAG laser welding. The lens <b>32</b> has a function of focusing the incoming light by the collimated light at a specific distance. It is adjusted almost in the center of the collimated light and fixed to the element carrier <b>16</b> by YAG laser welding.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The optical amplifier <b>131</b> is adjusted to the position where the light from the lens <b>32</b> focuses on. That is, the frame <b>132</b> to which the optical amplifier <b>131</b> is mounted is adjusted in the X-axis direction, Y-axis direction and Z-axis direction through the optical element holder <b>10</b>. Then, the optical element holder <b>10</b> is fixed to the element carrier <b>16</b> by YAG laser welding.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will be described more specifically. First, the frame <b>132</b> is inserted to the optical element holder <b>10</b> and the frame <b>132</b> is set in an instrument which is capable of adjusting it in the three axes direction of X, Y and Z. When the light of the laser element effectively enters the optical amplifier <b>131</b>, the light is amplified and a larger output of light can be achieved. By utilizing the effect, the frame <b>132</b> is adjusted in the optimum position by monitoring the optical output from the optical amplifier <b>131</b> to be the maximum using an optical power meter and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">After the adjustment, the optical element holder <b>10</b> and the element carrier <b>16</b> are fixed by YAG laser welding. Thereby, the position of the frame <b>132</b> in regards to the X direction is fixed. At this time, the conditions such as the output power and the time of performing YAG laser welding are set beforehand to be the optimum so that cracks are not generated in the metal joint area, i.e., the weld parts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>after the welding.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Subsequently, after adjusting the frame <b>132</b> to be in the optimum position in the movable directions of Y-axis and Z-axis, to make sure, the frame <b>132</b> and the optical element holder <b>10</b> are fixed once again by YAG laser welding.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the same manner, the lenses <b>33</b> and <b>86</b> are adjusted and fixed. At last, the optical fiber <b>88</b> is adjusted and fixed to the optimum position by monitoring the optical output.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Needless to say, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments. For example, an optical modulator may be used instead of using the optical amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Also, although the notches are used as the stress-suppressing sections, instead of the notches, a plurality of through-holes <b>101</b> may be used as the stress-suppressing sections by providing the through-holes <b>101</b> in the fixing sections <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Further, concave parts may be used instead of using the through-holes <b>101</b>. Any types of the stress-suppressing sections can be used as long as they can suppress the welding stress which affects the holding sections through the fixing sections when welding the fixing sections.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, with the present invention, it enables to prevent the optical element holder from being deformed by the welding stress through providing the stress-suppressing sections which shutter or ease the stress generated at the time of welding. Further, the dimension of the optical element holder can be reduced so that, by using it, the optical communication module can be made compact.</p>
