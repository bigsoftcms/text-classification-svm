<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/992,723, filed Nov. 22, 2004 now abandoned.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to in-house communication systems for communicating between locations in a building, such as intercoms and hospital bed paging systems, and particularly to a pneumatically or hydraulically operated system for communicating between locations in a building.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Communication systems for communicating between locations in a building are well known. For example, intercoms are used to communicate between persons wishing to enter an apartment or office building and the occupants of the building. Typically, the person wishing to enter the building presses an electric buzzer which sounds in the room of the occupants, thereby notifying them that a person wishes to gain entrance. The occupants then press a button that electrically opens a latch or some locking mechanism of the entrance door to the building, thereby permitting the person to enter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another example of such communication systems is a hospital bed paging system. Typically a patient is provided with a handheld device with a call button. The patient may press the button which electrically signals the nurse or other caretaker that the patient needs assistance of some kind.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The known communication systems for communicating between locations in a building are electrically operated. However, this may pose problems in certain situations. For example, if there is a power outage and no auxiliary generator power is available, the communication system cannot operate. As another example, for religious or logistic reasons, there may be times when it is not permissible to use electricity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention seeks to provide a fluid-operated (that is, pneumatically and/or hydraulically operated) system for communicating between locations in a building, as is described more in detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a communication system including a fluid-operated calling device which may be mounted in a first location in a building, and a fluid-operated indicator which may be mounted in a second location in a building and in fluid communication with the fluid-operated calling device, wherein actuation of the fluid-operated calling device causes the fluid-operated indicator to provide an indication that the fluid-operated calling device has been actuated. A fluid-operated lock may be mounted near the fluid-operated calling device and in fluid communication with a fluid-operated actuator, wherein actuation of the fluid-operated actuator causes opening of the fluid-operated lock. The fluid-operated actuator may be mounted in the same room as the fluid-operated indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a lock-open indicator may be associated with the fluid-operated lock and actuable by the fluid-operated lock and/or the fluid-operated actuator, wherein actuation of the lock-open indicator provides an indication that the fluid-operated lock is open.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the fluid-operated indicator and/or the lock-open indicator may include a fluid-operated shutter, which in a nominal position blocks viewing a visual indication, wherein actuation of the fluid-operated shutter includes movement of the fluid-operated shutter to permit viewing the visual indication. The visual indication may include a flashing light beam or a colored surface having a different color than an outer surface of the fluid-operated shutter.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which illustrate a communication system <b>10</b>, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The invention is described hereinbelow for an intercom system in a building, but it is appreciated that the invention is not limited to intercom systems, and also encompasses any in-house communication system, such as but not limited to, hospital bed paging systems, hotel paging systems, office building communication systems between rooms and many others.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The communication system <b>10</b> may include a fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b>, which may be mounted in a first location <b>14</b> in a building, such as at an entrance door. The fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b> may comprise, without limitation, a push button air valve, commercially available from such manufacturers as SMC, St. Paul, Minn. (standard or miniature series, for example) or Clippard International. The fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b> may be in fluid communication, such as via tubing <b>16</b>, with a fluid-operated indicator <b>18</b> mounted in a second location <b>20</b> in the building, such as on a wall in an apartment. The fluid-operated indicator <b>18</b> may comprise, without limitation, a fluid-operated shutter <b>22</b>, which in a nominal position blocks viewing a visual indication <b>24</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Upon actuation of the fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b>, the fluid-operated shutter <b>22</b> moves to permit viewing the visual indication <b>24</b>. The fluid-operated shutter <b>22</b> may be operated, without limitation, by means of an air solenoid, for example, commercially available in a wide variety of configurations from many manufacturers, e.g., Eaton Aeroquip. The visual indication <b>24</b> may be a flashing light beam, such as an incandescent flashing light, but the invention is not limited to this example.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> may be mounted near the fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b>, and may be in fluid communication with a fluid-operated actuator <b>28</b>, which may be mounted near the fluid-operated indicator <b>18</b>. Actuation of the fluid-operated actuator <b>28</b> causes opening of the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b>. A suitable example of the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> is the AIRLOCK 9400, commercially available from Airteq Systems, 1965 Mitchell Young Road, Montgomery, Ala., which is a medium security, remote-controlled, mortised-dead-latch pneumatic lock for 2-inch door frame installation. A pneumatic remote control unit with push button (e.g., available from Airteq or SMC) may serve as the fluid-operated actuator <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A lock-open indicator <b>30</b> may be associated with the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> and may be actuated by the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> and/or the fluid-operated actuator <b>28</b>. The lock-open indicator <b>30</b> provides an indication when the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> is open. The lock-open indicator <b>30</b> may comprise, without limitation, the Air Indicator unit, commercially available from SMC. The Air Indicator has a lens which displays clear in the absence of pressure and displays bright when activated at approximately 5 PSI (this is a non-limiting example of air pressure, and the communication system <b>10</b> may be charged to and operate at any other suitable air or hydraulic pressure). Air Indicators are available with red or green display and black or gray panel mount bezel. The Air Indicator is another example of a fluid-operated shutter, which in a nominal position blocks viewing a visual indication, wherein movement of the shutter permits viewing the visual indication. In this example, the visual indication includes a colored surface of a different color (e.g., red or green) than an outer surface of the fluid-operated shutter (e.g., black or gray).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is noted that alternatively the fluid-operated indicator <b>18</b> may comprise an Air Indicator and the like, and the lock-open indicator <b>30</b> may comprise a flashing light beam with shutter and the like, and of course may include other types of fluid-operated indicators.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A person wishing to enter the building may press the fluid-operated calling device <b>12</b>. This may cause the fluid-operated shutter <b>22</b> to move, as indicated by arrow <b>29</b>, thereby permitting viewing the visual indication <b>24</b> (e.g., flashing light). The occupant of the room where the fluid-operated indicator <b>18</b> is installed sees the visual indication <b>24</b> and realizes that a person wishes to enter the building.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The occupant may press the fluid-operated actuator <b>28</b>, which causes the fluid-operated lock <b>26</b> to open, thereby permitting the person to enter the building. The person wishing to enter the building realizes that the lock <b>26</b> is open by means of the lock-open indicator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to pneumatics and may also comprise hydraulic components. It is also appreciated that the communication system <b>10</b> may be redundantly powered by electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.
