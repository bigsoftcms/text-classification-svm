In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, image projector <b>67</b> is illustrated as having been removed from slot <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Housing <b>68</b> is configured to support image projector <b>67</b>, and arms <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are manipulatable to enable directional control of image output of image projector <b>67</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, arm <b>70</b> is illustrated as having been rotated about axis A<b>3</b> to locate arm <b>72</b> in a generally upright position, and arm <b>72</b> is illustrated as having been rotated about axis A<b>4</b> to facilitate directional control of image content output by image projector <b>67</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, image projector <b>67</b> is configured for wireless communications with computer device <b>12</b> (e.g. via a wireless receiver <b>80</b>). However, it should be understood that data and/or power communications may be provided via a wired connection between image projector <b>67</b> and computer device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide an image projector integrated with a portable computer device, thereby enabling the image projector to be easily stored within or coupled to the computer device, thereby reducing the likelihood of misplacement or damage to the image projector and the need to transport separate components to a presentation. For example, embodiments of the present invention provide an image projector integrally couplable to a device such that the image projector is physically securable to the device (e.g., aside from a mode of data communication between the image projector and the computer device (e.g., a cable)) to facilitate transport of the image projector and the device as a single, integral unit. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, image projector <b>54</b> is coupled to and/or otherwise forms part of power supply <b>11</b>, which in turn is physically couplable to computer device <b>12</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, image projector <b>67</b> is physically coupled to computer device <b>12</b> via multi-bay slot <b>74</b>. Thus, embodiments of the present invention enable an image projector to be coupled to a computer device by a means other than a cable or other wired mode such that the image projector and device are transportable as and/or otherwise form a single unit. Preferably, the image projector is configured to be contained within the overall profile of the device when the image projector is at least disposed in a stored position relative to the device (or at least substantially within the profile of the device), thereby facilitating transport of the image projector and the device as a unit. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention enable the image projector to be independently powered, provide power to the computer device, receive power from the computer device, or receive power from another external source. Further, in embodiments of the present invention where the image projector is self-powered (e.g., via battery cells <b>51</b> or <b>73</b>), recharging of the battery cells <b>51</b> or <b>73</b> may be performed by the computer device <b>20</b> or another external power source. Also, embodiments of the present invention enable operation of the image projector while being detached from the computer device, thereby providing additional flexibility for using the image projector.</p>
