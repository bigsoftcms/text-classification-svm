<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates generally to accelerometers and more particularly to self-calibrating accelerometers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of the gyro, a specific class of gyro was identified in which the gyro bias reversed polarity when the drive and sense axes were interchanged. This particular class of gyro was identified as Class II Coriolis Vibratory Gyro and is characterized by being inherently counterbalanced, symmetrical about the input axis and having orthogonal degenerate vibration modes. Self calibration of the gyro bias is achieved by employing two gyros to measure the angular rate and sequentially reversing the gyro bias. The sequence of data from the gyros may be processed in an algorithm to solve for the gyro biases and subtract them from the measured rate. The two self-calibrated gyro angular rate measurements are averaged to reduce the angle random walk.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Self-calibration of accelerometer bias can be achieved in a manor similar to the self-calibration of gyro bias. In the case of the accelerometer the polarity of the scale factor is reversed. A method for reversing the scale factor polarity of an accelerometer is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,896, &#x201c;High Accuracy Accelerometer&#x201d;. Self-calibration of accelerometer bias is achieved by employing two accelerometers to measure the acceleration and sequentially reverse the accelerometer scale factor. The polarity of the accelerometer bias remains unchanged and the sequence of data from the accelerometers is processed in the previously disclosed algorithm to solve for the accelerometer biases and subtract them form the measured acceleration. The two self-calibrated accelerometer acceleration measurements are averaged to reduce the velocity random walk.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accelerometer bias uncertainty is a major source of error in inertial measurement and navigation systems. Bias uncertainty arises due to transient behavior at turn on, non-modelablity and instability of bias versus temperature characteristics including hysteresis and simply trend over time. Reduction or elimination of accelerometer bias uncertainty would significantly improve the performance of inertial measurement and navigation systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a need in the art for improved self-calibrating accelerometers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The apparatus may comprise: a sensing element for an accelerometer having a bias, the sensing element having a rectangular plate supported by flexures which allow rotation about a transverse center line thereof; a center of mass (CG) of the sensing element having two stable positions, one on each side of an axis of rotation defined by a centerline of suspension; a secondary mass within a proofmass translates in-plane to move the center of mass to thereby effect a self-calibration mechanization that continuously measures and nulls the accelerometer's bias under dynamic operating conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The principle of mass modulation is described in patent disclosure 001234-199.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A proofmass being electrostatically force rebalanced using a pulse width modulated, charge control, servo is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,921. An actuation method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,591,027 for a &#x201c;Bi-stable Micro Actuator and Optical Switch&#x201d;. The principle of mass modulation is also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,896 High Accuracy Accelerometer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following describes one embodiment for a self-calibrating accelerometer. While embodiments according to the present method and apparatus may be implemented as a single accelerometer, a three axis planar accelerometer configuration is described as one embodiment. This self-calibration mechanization continuously measures and nulls the accelerometer's bias under dynamic operating conditions. It is to be understood that the embodiments of the present method and apparatus may also be utilized in a single axis planar accelerometer configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of a self-calibrating accelerometer that may have a Z axis with its sensitive or input axis (IA) normal to the plane of the of the sensing element <b>102</b>. The sensing element <b>102</b> may be a rectangular plate supported by flexures which allow rotation about a transverse center line. The apex of the triangle <b>103</b> depicts this centerline of suspension (CS) as a fulcrum supported by a substrate <b>101</b>. The center of mass (CG) of the sensing element <b>102</b> is shown as having two stable positions, one on each side of the axis of rotation defined by the centerline of suspension. A secondary mass within the proofmass translates in-plane to move the center of mass right and left. This mechanization is described in more detail below. The ability to change the location of the center of mass is called mass modulation. Relocating the center of mass from one side of the centerline of suspension to the other reverses the polarity of the input axis and enables self-calibration of accelerometer bias. Under acceleration the sensing element rotates clockwise about the centerline of support (CS) with the center of mass in the CG1 position and counter clockwise with the center of mass in the CG2 position. The proofmass may be electrostatically force rebalanced using, for example, a pulse width modulated, charge control, servo.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of a self-calibrating accelerometer having X and Y axis with its sensitive or input axis (IA) in-plane. To change the polarity of the accelerometer, the centers of mass (CG1, and CG2), in this case, may be moved vertically between two bistable positions above and below the centerline of suspension (CS) for the sensing element <b>202</b>. That is, this is accomplished by translating the secondary mass up and down out-of-plane. The electrostatic force rebalance servo functions in the same manner as described above for the Z axis configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Historically, bias stability and repeatability over time and temperature have been the most difficult accelerometer performance requirements to meet. Embodiments according to the present method and apparatus for the self-calibrating accelerometer alleviate this difficulty by continuously self-calibrating the accelerometer bias under both static and dynamic conditions and thereby remove accelerometer bias as an error source. Bias self-calibration requires successive simultaneous measurements of acceleration by two accelerometers with sequentially alternating polarities. The outputs of the accelerometers may be processed in a digital signal processor using the real time bias estimator algorithm described in patent disclosure 000856-199. The alternating polarity reversal is accomplished by alternating the location of the center of mass of the sensing element to opposite sides of the centerline of support as noted earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the Z axis sensing element <b>304</b> according to the present method and apparatus. The sensing element <b>304</b> may be a proofmass <b>303</b> supported by flexures <b>307</b> to the sensing element <b>304</b> about a center line of suspension <b>302</b>. Within the proofmass <b>303</b> is a secondary mass <b>305</b> shown in one of two bistable positions. The secondary mass <b>305</b> is supported by four buckled flexure elements <b>306</b> that are held in compression. Thermal actuators (not shown) momentarily reduce the compressive force below the critical buckling force causing the secondary mass <b>305</b> to translate to the other bistable position. The input axis is normal to the plane of the sensing element and the rotational response of the proofmass to acceleration is reversed while non-acceleration induced torques on the sensing element do not reverse as the center of mass translates between the two bistable positions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plan view of the X and Y axes sensing element according to the present method and apparatus. The sensing element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> consists of the same components as the sensing element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The secondary mass <b>305</b> within the proofmass <b>303</b> is supported by buckled beam flexures <b>306</b> which cause the two bistable positions of the secondary mass <b>305</b> to be above and below a neutral in-plane position. The center of mass CG<sub>1 </sub>in this case is either above or below the center of support. The input axis is therefore in the plane of the sensing element <b>302</b> and normal to the plane containing the centerline of suspension and the center of mass.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded view of a MEMS three axis planar accelerometer. In the depicted embodiment, three proofmass structures without mass modulated sensing elements <b>505</b> are shown. A pair of these three axis accelerometers with mass modulation are used to simultaneously measure acceleration along three orthogonal axes with alternating input axis polarity. The accelerometer outputs are applied to the real time bias estimator algorithm which determines and nulls the bias of each accelerometer. In this embodiment a bottom cover <b>501</b> is operatively coupled to a center element <b>504</b> via a dielectric layer <b>503</b>. The center element <b>504</b> may have a proofmass <b>505</b>. A top cover <b>507</b> may be operatively coupled to the center element <b>504</b> by another dielectric layer <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a timing sequence for accelerometer bias errors that may be directly observable if two accelerometers are operated in parallel. One embodiment of a real time bias estimator algorithm is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accelerometer bias errors may be directly observable if two accelerometers are operated in parallel. Such a timing sequence would be as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for an accelerometer A with its associated bias <b>601</b> and an accelerometer B with its associated bias <b>602</b>.</p>
