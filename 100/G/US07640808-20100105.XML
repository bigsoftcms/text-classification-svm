<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a strip to be inserted between two elements in order to cause acoustic attenuation of the noise propagating through at least one of the elements, the strip being made of at least one plastic-based damping material i.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such a strip may especially be used for glazing in vehicles, particularly automobiles, for the purpose of improving acoustic comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In automobiles, the sources of discomfiture, of mechanical, thermal, visibility or other origin, have gradually been overcome. However, improvement in acoustic comfort still remains to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aerodynamic noise, i.e. noise created by the friction of the air over a moving vehicle, has, at least in part, been dealt with at its source, that is to say, to save energy, shapes have been modified, thus improving penetration through the air and decreasing turbulence, which is itself a source of noise. Among the walls of a vehicle that separate the external source of aerodynamic noise from the interior space where the passengers are, the windows are obviously the most difficult to deal with. It is not possible to use pasty or fibrous absorbents, that are reserved for the opaque walls, and, for practical reasons or for reasons of weight, the thicknesses cannot be increased inconsiderably. European patent EP-B1-0 387 148 discloses glazing assemblies that exhibit good insulation against aerodynamic noise without their weight and/or their thicknesses being increased too greatly. The patent thus provides a laminated glazing assembly whose interlayer has a flexural damping factor &#x3bd;=&#x394;f/f<sub>c </sub>of greater than 0.15, the measurement being carried out by exciting, by means of a shock, a laminated bar 9 cm in length and 3 cm in width of a laminated glass in which the resin is between two thick glass panes, each 4 mm in thickness, and by measuring f<sub>c</sub>, the resonant frequency of the first mode, and &#x394;f, the width of the peak at an amplitude of A/&#x221a;{square root over (2)} where A is the maximum amplitude at the frequency f<sub>c </sub>such that its acoustic damping index does not differ, for any frequency greater than 800 Hz, by more than 5 dB from a reference index that increases by 9 dB per octave up to 2 000 Hz and by 3 dB per octave at higher frequencies. In addition, the standard deviation &#x3c3; of the differences in its acoustic damping index compared with the reference index remains less than 4 dB. The thicknesses of the two glass panes may be identical and equal to 2.2 mm. That patent thus provides a general solution to the problem of acoustic insulation with respect to the aerodynamic noise of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, the treatment of glazing assemblies for protection against solid-borne noise, i.e. against noise transmitted via solids, in the frequency range from 50 to 300 Hz or even 800 Hz, is more difficult to achieve. This is because it turns out that the use of connecting pieces remains inadequate for avoiding transmission of the noise through vibration of the glazing. In this regard, it has been found that a humming noise perceptible to passengers appears at certain rotation speeds of the engine, thus creating a source of discomfiture. This is because the rotation of the engine creates vibrations that are transmitted, for example, to the bodywork and thus, via a chain effect, to the windows. It is known that the energy acquired by an object subjected to a shock causes a vibration phenomenon and that, immediately after the shock, the object, now free again, vibrates in its natural mode. A vibration frequency is associated with each mode. The amplitude of the vibration depends on the initial excitation, i.e. on the spectral component of the shock (the amplitude of the shock at the frequency studied) and on the area of impact of the shock, the modal deformation being greater or smaller depending on whether the shock occurs at a vibration antinode or at a vibration node.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order for a natural mode to be excited:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">(1) the deformation caused at the point of impact must not be at a vibration node of the mode; and,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">(2) the energy spectrum of the shock must have a component at the resonant frequency of the mode.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">The latter condition is virtually always fulfilled, since a very brief shock has a virtually uniform energy spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">The first condition is also fulfilled and, for a bar free at its ends for example, all that is required is to tap one of the ends in order to excite all the modes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Solid-borne excitation is peripheral and it has been demonstrated that, at certain engine vibration frequencies, that is to say at certain rotation speeds of the engine, the windows and the passenger compartment of the vehicle each have a vibration mode whose coupling amplifies the humming that arises from the radiation of noise emanating in this case from the engine, via the windows. Of course, the rotation speed of the engine that gives rise to these phenomena is peculiar to each type of vehicle and thus cannot be generalized to a single value.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Thus, to improve acoustic comfort in the passenger compartment of the vehicle with respect to solid-borne noise, patent EP 0 844 075 proposes a laminated glazing assembly comprising at least one interlayer film possessing very satisfactory damping properties as regards audible solid-borne sounds, since it has a loss factor tan &#x3b4; of greater than 0.6 and a shear modulus G&#x2032; of less than 2&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>N/m<sup>2</sup>, within a temperature range between 10 and 60&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Another solution may consist in placing around the periphery of the glazing a strip with acoustic damping properties. For this purpose, patent DE 198 06 122 proposes a strip that firstly bonds the pane of the vehicle to the bodywork and also acts as a damper. The strip is hollow and filled with a pasty material whose function is to damp the vibrations, the body of the strip being made of an adhesive material that becomes elastic after crosslinking.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">However, the latter solution has the drawback that the strip does not have a stiffness sufficient to guarantee the desired acoustic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Firstly, the strip described, which is a coextruded bead, is designed to be compressed between the glazing and the bodywork, but this method of application by compression, coupled with the constituent materials of the strip, does not guarantee the desired final dimensional shape. Now, after the glazing has been attached to the bodywork by means of said strip, it is essential for the dimensions of the strip to be maintained throughout the damping performance that it must provide, as we will see in the description of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Secondly, the pasty material internal to the body of the strip remains soft and there is no guarantee that it remains confined after the coextruded bead has been compressed against the bodywork element, since the body of the strip formed from the adhesive material is also pasty before crosslinking, thereby incurring, during deposition of the bead, the risk of the internal pasty material spreading out beyond the body of the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The object of the invention is therefore to provide, as acoustic damping solution, especially for the glazing of automobiles, a strip that does not have the drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">According to the invention, the strip is characterized in that it has an equivalent real stiffness per unit length K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>equal to at least 25 MPa and an equivalent loss factor tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq </sub>equal to at least 0.25.</p>

The inventors have also been able to show that the properties could even be achieved for noise in the 300 to 1 000 Hz range, known as dirty noise, in particular for laminated glazing assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0059">Finally, the inventors have demonstrated that this strip may also provide acoustic damping of aerodynamic noise, that is to say for frequencies above 1 000 Hz, when, however, the glazing is more particularly monolithic, that is to say formed from a single sheet of glass.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0078">These figures are schematic and the relative proportions of the various quantities, especially the thicknesses and widths, between the various elements of the invention have not been drawn to scale so as to make them easier to examine.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a partial sectional view of a glazing assembly <b>1</b> joined to a carrier element <b>2</b>, such as the bodywork of an automobile. The glazing assembly, formed from at least one glass substrate, is attached to the bodywork by means of a strip <b>3</b> with acoustic damping properties.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">Consequently, the strip <b>3</b>, joined to and inserted between two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> that are, for example, the bodywork and the glazing respectively, fulfills, apart from its vibration damping function according to the invention, the function of a device for bonding the two elements, while providing a sealing function in order to protect the passenger compartment of the vehicle from exposure to the external environment, such as exposure to dust, moisture, water. However, in another application, the strip could be inserted between the two elements only to fulfill just its damping function, without fulfilling a function of bonding the two elements together. For example, the strip may be attached to a first element, such as a door frame of a room inside a building and may be joined to a second element, such as the door when it is closed; the strip, being stressed by the surfaces of the door and of the frame sufficiently to absorb the exciting energy of the frame, reduces the acoustic radiation inside the volume closed by said door.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">The construction of the strip <b>3</b> will be described below. The strip may be embellished with functional forms that are not specifically acoustic, such as with sealing lips or with a trim.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">The acoustic damping properties of the strip are defined by the equivalent stiffness per unit length and the loss factor parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">The strip may be formed from a single material or else from a plurality of materials, and in the latter case it is necessary to take into account the stiffness per unit length of each material. This is why the term &#x201c;equivalent stiffness per unit length&#x201d;, denoted by K*<sub>eq</sub>, is used, which term therefore corresponds to the equivalent stiffness for the entire strip and the word &#x201c;linear&#x201d; being used to indicate that it relates to 1 m of strip.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">The equivalent stiffness per unit length K*eq is known to be a complex number written as K*<sub>eq</sub>=K&#x2032;<sub>eq</sub>+j K&#x2033;<sub>eq </sub>with a real part K&#x2032;<sub>eq</sub>, called in the description the equivalent real stiffness per unit length, and an imaginary part K&#x2033;<sub>eq </sub>that corresponds to the loss factor, that is to say to the conversion of the deformation energy of the strip into thermal energy throughout the entire strip.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085">K*<sub>eq </sub>may be written according to the following formula, because the strip may comprise several materials:

<p id="p-0072" num="0088">&#x3b1;=1 for a juxtaposition of several materials i in parallel, that is to say in an arrangement called a juxtaposition in the rest of the description.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0089">In the case of a combination of a stack and a juxtaposition, the equivalent stiffness per unit length of the stack and of the juxtaposition will be calculated and the strip will then be normalized to just a stack or to just a juxtaposition such that &#x3b1;=&#x2212;1 or &#x3b1;=1, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0090">This gives, for example for two materials in series:

<p id="p-0081" num="0097">The reader is reminded that, in the invention, one of the parameters characterizing the acoustic properties of the strip is the equivalent real stiffness per unit length K&#x2032;<sub>eq</sub>, i.e. the real part of the complex number K*<sub>eq</sub>. As explained above, K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>may be estimated by calculation after having measured the Young's modulus E&#x2032;<sub>i </sub>of each material using a viscoanalyzer. K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>may be measured using a viscoanalyzer in order to check the calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">These calculations are appropriate, however, when the shape of the strip is rectangular. For any other shape, this quantity will in fact be measured using the viscoanalyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099">The selection of materials to be used so as to form the strip when these materials are not of simple rectangular shape will be made on the basis of approximation calculations, by approximating the actual cross section of each material to a rectangular cross section for which the strip is subjected to the tensile-compressive forces. If the calculations are favorable to this selection of materials, as they satisfy the claimed criteria that will be presented below, these calculations will have to be checked by measurement using the viscoanalyzer.</p>

where K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>is the equivalent real stiffness per unit length (the real part of K*<sub>eq</sub>) for the entire strip and K&#x2033;<sub>eq </sub>is the loss modulus (imaginary part of K*<sub>eq</sub>).
</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0103">In a manner similar to that of estimating the equivalent real stiffness per unit length, the loss factor will be estimated by calculation using equation (3), equations (1) and (2) serving to calculate K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>and K&#x2033;<sub>eq</sub>, K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>and K&#x2033;<sub>eq </sub>being estimated by calculation using the measurement by the viscoanalyzer of the real part and of the imaginary part of the complex Young's modulus of each constituent material of the strip, respectively. The measurement from the entire strip using the viscoanalyzer will be used to confirm the calculations, particularly when selecting materials of any nonrectangular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0104">In all cases, to ensure that the strip meets the claimed criterion that will be presented below regarding this loss factor, a measurement of the equivalent real stiffness per unit length by the viscoanalyzer and a calculation of the loss factor will be made.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0105">According to the invention, the strip <b>3</b> exhibits acoustic damping properties when the equivalent loss factor tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq </sub>of the strip is equal to at least 0.25.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0106">The equivalent loss factor and the equivalent real stiffness per unit length depend not only on the chemical nature of the material or materials of the strip but also on the geometry given to the cross section of the strip. In addition, when a strip meets the claimed criteria according to the invention regarding the equivalent loss factor and the equivalent stiffness per unit length, it is possible to optimize these parameters by modifying them so as to further enhance the acoustic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0107">These parameters are modified by changing the dimensions of the cross section of the strip. For example, if the strip is formed from a single material and has a rectangular cross section, its equivalent real stiffness per unit length is then increased by reducing the thickness e of the strip and by increasing its width L.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0108">The strip <b>3</b> may be formed structurally in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0109">According to a first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <b>1</b><i>c</i>, the strip <b>3</b> is formed from at least one damping material <b>4</b> that fulfills the acoustic damping function and also the function of bonding the two elements together and optionally the sealing function, depending on the type of use for which the strip is intended. In the example in question of glazing for an automobile, the strip preferably also fulfills the sealing function. This strip configuration comprising one or more damping materials that also fulfill an adhesive function for bonding the two elements together will be called in the rest of the description a monolithic strip.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0110">According to this first embodiment, a first version (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) consists in making the strip from a single material that meets the stipulated criteria as regards the equivalent loss factor and the equivalent real stiffness per unit length and that has the properties of adhesion to the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and if necessary sealing properties.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0111">A second version of the first embodiment consists in making the strip <b>3</b> from two damping materials <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>that meet the criteria of the invention. These materials, one of which may be relatively more damping or less damping than the other, result, when they are combined, in an equivalent real stiffness per unit length and an equivalent loss factor that meet the damping criteria. They are placed as layers one on top of the other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) or are juxtaposed one beside the other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>) and optionally separated by an air gap (not illustrated). Both materials exhibit adhesion properties with respect to at least one of the two elements to which they are joined.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0112">It is also possible to envision more than two damping materials taken in combination as a juxtaposition or as a stack (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0113">Examples of materials that can be used for a monolithic strip will be mentioned later in the description.</p>

The material <b>4</b> provides the acoustic damping function and is bonded to at least one of the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to be joined together, whereas the adhesive material <b>5</b> provides the function of bonding the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> together, being bonded to at least one of the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The materials <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are chemically compatible in order to guarantee, if necessary, depending on the embodiment, their mutual adhesion. The materials <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> may exhibit sealing properties depending on the use of the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0115">In this second embodiment, the nondamping adhesive material <b>5</b> serves merely to bond the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and also has sealing properties. By itself it has no acoustic damping property. However, it is necessary for it to have an appropriate thickness and width, since it has a Young's modulus E<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; and a loss factor tan &#x3b4; that have an influence on the equivalent real stiffness per unit length and the equivalent loss factor of the entire strip <b>3</b> and therefore on the acoustic damping properties of the entire strip <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0118">It may be of the juxtaposed type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>d</i>), i.e. the materials may or may not be beside one another, each of the materials having two opposed surfaces bonded to the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to be joined together, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0145">It is also possible to select a polyurethane-based material with a wide variety of reactive compositions of the one-component or two-component type. As an example, mentioned may especially be made of one-component compositions based on a polyurethane prepolymer with a polyester, polyether, polycaprolactone, polyolefin or polysiloxane backbone. The advantage of a siloxane-terminated prepolymer is that it is moisture-curable and does not foam. These polyurethane compositions may be modified by an elastomer, especially by a nitrile, SBR or butyl rubber, or by a thermoplastic elastomer or else by a non-crosslinkable polymer having a certain flexibility, such as polyolefins or plasticized PVC.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0147">The polyols of the compositions may be polyetherpolyols, of the polyethylene, propylene oxide or polytetramethylene oxide type, a polycarbonate polyol or polybutadiene polyol or polyesterpolyols, these being amorphous or crystalline, aromatic or aliphatic, and based on fatty acid dimers, aromatic or aliphatic diacids, castor oil or chain extenders of the 1,3- or 1,4-butanediol, diisopropyl glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, hexanediol or carbitol type. The molecular mass of these polyols will be defined by their hydroxyl index (iOH) defined in the ASTM E 222-94 standard as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent to the hydroxyl content of 1 gram of polyol. The NOH range used is between 5 and 1 500. The functionality of these polyols will be between 2 and 6.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0148">The isocyanates may be aromatic or aliphatic, among which are diphenyl-methane diisocyanates (MDI), toluene diisocyanates (TDI), isophorone diisocyanates (IPDI) and hexane diisocyanate (HDI). The nature of the isocyanates is also defined by their NCO percentage content which, in the ASTM D 5155-96 standard, is defined as the proportion by weight of isocyanate (NCO) functional groups present in the product. The functionality of the products is between 2 and 2.7.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0149">The catalysts needed for the reaction between the polyols and the isocyanates may be tin catalysts such as dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) or tin octoate. It is also possible to use bismuth catalysts or catalysts based on morpholines, such as dimorpholinodiethyl ether (DMDEE).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0150">To prevent the selected prepolymer from foaming, it is possible to add an antifoam additive, which is a compound based on bisoxazolidines. Finally, various plasticizers may also be advantageously added to the prepolymer selected.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0151">In general, the strip <b>3</b> is applied between the elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in the following manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>): the strip <b>3</b> is deposited on the element <b>1</b> by an application technique that we will expand upon in the rest of the description. Depending on the chemical nature of the free surface of the strip to be joined to the element <b>2</b>, this surface is either conventionally bonded, as it has bonding properties at room temperature, or else this free surface is activated using an energy source <b>7</b> of the infrared, ultraviolet, high-frequency, microwave or induction type, and when the surface reaches a suitable temperature, the strip joined to the first element <b>1</b>, such as the substrate, is pressed against the second element <b>2</b>, such as the bodywork, in order to bond them together. The amount of energy and the thickness of the activated material or materials are gaged in order to obtain the final width and thickness that are desired between the two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0152">The strip <b>3</b> may be applied against the first element in various ways. The technique employed may depend on the nature of the material or materials and on the arrangement&#x2014;stacked and/or juxtaposed&#x2014;of the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0153">At least four techniques for depositing the gaged strip may be used, separately or in combination: extrusion, overmolding (encapsulation) and transfer from a molding. As regards the transfer process, reference may be made for further details to French patent application FR 01/15039.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0154">The extrusion technique ensures that the strip has a constant geometry. Advantageously, the shape given to the strip may make it easier for it to be bonded to the element to which it is joined in order to guarantee the desired geometry. The damping materials used must have viscosities between 100 and 500 Pa&#xb7;s at 80&#xb0; C., the materials setting below 50&#xb0; C. The materials will therefore have a green strength and a thixotropy that are sufficient to maintain their geometry after extrusion. Preferably, they will be of the one-component type and will ensure good bonding to the first element being joined to it, such as the glass substrate in the example cited.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0155">In the second technique, the strip may be overmolded on one of the elements so as advantageously to give it any of the desired shapes and thus optimize the acoustic performance, while guaranteeing the dimensions of the strip at any point on the glazing, as it may be necessary for the width and the thickness of the strip not to be uniform over the entire perimeter of the element to which it is joined for the requirements of the acoustic performance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The viscosity of the materials used must not exceed a certain limit and the setting of a two-component product must be rapid.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0156">In the third technique, the strip may also be molded and transferred to one of the elements in order to preserve the advantages of the molding and to reduce the mold production costs. This technique combines the advantages of extrusion and overmolding, as it allows several layers of materials of various shapes to be created, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d. </i>As in the case of extrusion, a minimum green strength and a minimum viscosity of the materials are required for moisture-crosslinking one-component materials. The setting time may be rapid if thermally crosslinking one-component-type systems are employed. As regards two-component systems, these set rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0157">Finally, an injection molding technique is also conceivable. In this case, the element to which the material has to be joined is placed in a mold having a cavity corresponding to the shapes of the strip that it is desired to produce and molding material formed by the damping material is injected in the molten state into the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0158">Among the examples of techniques used, a distinction will be made below between joining the two elements together according to the first embodiment of the strip, that is to say as a monolithic strip, and according to the second embodiment, namely when the strip comprises at least two materials <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> corresponding to the damping material and to the nondamping adhesive material, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0159">In the case of a monolithic strip <b>3</b>, it is applied against the glass substrate <b>1</b> by selecting one of the four techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0160">As regards extrusion against the element <b>1</b>, therefore with a single damping material <b>4</b> that also provides the function of bonding to the element, the inventors have developed a material A that meets the criteria of the invention, the surface of which is activatable so as to be bonded to the element <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0165" num="0228">Finally, the inventors have chosen to illustrate the acoustic performance of the strip <b>3</b> by plotting the equivalent real stiffness per unit length K&#x2032;<sub>eq </sub>as a function of the equivalent loss factor tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq </sub>in the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The values of the equivalent loss factor are plotted on the x-axis and the values of the equivalent real stiffness per unit length are plotted on the y-axis. On the basis of these values, the graph indicates the modal damping in the first flexural mode measured on a glass substrate (800 mm by 500 mm and 4 mm in thickness) bonded to a bed by means of the strip placed around the periphery and on one face of the substrate, it being possible for the equivalent loss factor tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq </sub>to be between 0.15 and 1, and for the equivalent real stiffness per unit length not to exceed 400 MPa. It may be noted that the values of the gains given for tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq</sub>=1 may be extrapolated to tan &#x3b4;<sub>eq</sub>&#x3e;1 for the same values of the equivalent stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0229">The modal damping is expressed on a scale of 0 to 30%. The greater the damping, the higher the acoustic gain in dB.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0230">The modal damping in the first flexural mode is defined as follows. The modal damping is deduced from measurements of the mechanical impedance Z (modulus of the frequency response function giving the vibration speed normal to the glass substrate at one point as a function of the point load applied at this same point in the direction normal to said substrate) made using an impact hammer and an accelerometer at the center of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0231">The frequency of the first flexural mode corresponds to that frequency below 120 Hz for which the mechanical impedance is a maximum. It is denoted by f<b>1</b>. The value of the mechanical impedance of the frequency f<b>1</b> is denoted by Zmax.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0232">The bandwidth at mid-height corresponds to the width of the frequency range around f<b>1</b> for which Z&#x3e;Zmax/&#x221e;{square root over (2)}. It is denoted by &#x394;f.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0233">The modal damping of the first flexural mode corresponds to the ratio &#x394;f/f<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0234">The graph shows from the values that the modal damping and therefore the acoustic performance (gain in dB) are variables for a given loss factor and different equivalent stiffnesses, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0235">Thus, it is possible to obtain a modal damping close to 30% for an equivalent real stiffness per unit length of 100 MPa and a loss factor between 0.5 and 1, whereas the damping does not exceed 5% if the loss factor is only 0.3 for the same real stiffness per unit length of 100 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0236">It may also be seen that for a loss factor of 0.8 for example, the optimum equivalent real stiffness per unit length will be around 100 MPa and that increasing the equivalent real stiffness per unit length will only decrease the modal damping that can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0237">This graph demonstrates that the use of the material A, as explained above for a monolithic strip and having an equivalent real stiffness per unit length of 400 MPa and an equivalent loss factor of 0.3, generates modal damping of between 5 and 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0238">The use of the material B combined with a nondamping polyurethane mastic for the strip taken as the above example in the second embodiment, that has an equivalent real stiffness per unit length of 70 MPa and an equivalent loss factor of 0.95, generates modal damping of more than 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0239">Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows three comparative curves of the noise measured inside an automobile as a function of the engine speed for three types of strip.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0240">Curve C<b>1</b> corresponds to a standard laminated glazing assembly equipped with a standard strip made from nondamping polyurethane mastic with a reference cross section of 9 mm by 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0241">Curve C<b>2</b> corresponds to a standard glazing assembly equipped with a monolithic strip according to the invention formed from the damping material <b>4</b> of composition A with a reference cross section of 15 mm by 3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0242">Curve C<b>3</b> corresponds to a standard glazing assembly equipped with a strip according to the invention formed from the damping material <b>4</b> of composition B and from the nondamping adhesive material <b>5</b> made of a polyurethane mastic with a reference cross section of 15 mm by 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0243">The term &#x201c;standard laminated glazing assembly&#x201d; is understood to mean one comprising two 2.1 mm thick sheets of glass and a 0.76 mm thick interlayer film of polyvinyl butyral.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0246">The curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> demonstrate the improved noise reduction achieved thanks to the strip of the invention. In this figure, the noise expressed in dB is plotted as a function of the engine speed in rpm of the vehicle. The measured noise here is that generated within the 50-160 Hz frequency range, these frequencies corresponding to solid-borne noise and corresponding to an engine speed of 1 500 to 5 000 rpm with regard to the given type of automobile taken here as example.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0247">It should be noted that the measurements are independent of the area of the glazing assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0248">The results show that at a frequency of 110 Hz, corresponding to 3 400 rpm and at a normal speed on a freeway, the noise measured on the glazing assembly corresponding to curve C<b>1</b> is much higher than the noise measured on the glazing assembly corresponding to curve C<b>2</b> and even more compared with that corresponding to curve C<b>3</b>; noise damping, of 4 dB and 13 dB respectively, is thus obtained thanks to the strip of the invention according to one of the two versions respectively, as may be seen also from the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0249">It may be preferable to use the strip corresponding to curve C<b>2</b>, as this exhibits good damping performance at 3 400 rpm and also exhibits good performance for a speed above 4 000 rpm, for which it may be seen that the measured noise is 82 dB, whereas the measured noise corresponding to curve C<b>1</b> with a standard strip is 87 dB. This result is obtained since the equivalent real stiffness per unit length of this strip of the invention is much greater than that of the standard strip.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0250">The strip of the invention with acoustic damping properties has been described by way of example for the case in which it is inserted between two elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, such as a glass substrate and an automobile body, for the purpose of bonding one to the other, and therefore for a glass-metal joint. Other applications may be envisioned for the use of the acoustic damping strip of the invention, for example for metal-metal, glass-glass, metal-plastic, glass-plastic and plastic-plastic joints. The term &#x201c;plastic&#x201d; is understood to mean plastics such as an epoxy, a polyester, a polycarbonate, a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin, or composites based on a plastic, such as polypropylene (PP), and reinforcing fibers, such as glass fibers or wood fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0251">An example of a metal-metal joint is that of metal parts bonded to the bodywork of a vehicle. Thus, the mechanical components for opening the doors and windows that are normally attached by means of bolts may instead be attached by bonding using a damping strip of the invention in order to attenuate the radiation of noise into the passenger compartment of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0252">An example of a glass-plastic joint is that obtained when bonding a rear window of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0253">An example of a plastic-plastic or plastic-metal joint is that obtained when bonding the various elements that make up the tailgate of an automobile, or else the adhesive bonding of a roof based on a polyurethane foam reinforced with glass fibers to the metal body of the vehicle.</p>
