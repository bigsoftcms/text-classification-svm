<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Safety equipment for eyes and ears has become more important daily in countless situations and especially in work environments. Governmental and insurance regulations have reinforced that importance. Safety glasses and earplugs are therefore well known. More recently, devices combining safety glasses and earplugs have been proposed. These combinations can do away with the clumsy separate eye and ear protection devices which are less than user friendly. Problems with these proposed devices remain, though, and include means for attachment to glasses, poor ear fit, difficult ear plug alignment, excessive temple and ear tension, lack of component memory, and limited adjustability. All of these problems easily result in a lack of use of eye and ear protection. The present apparatus successfully solves these problems and more.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The ear protection apparatus relates to safety glasses and earplugs and more especially to an ear protection apparatus which attaches to eyeglasses and provides various temple bar attachment means combined with multiple means for adjustably positioning earplugs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The general purpose of the ear protection apparatus, described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a ear protection apparatus which has many novel features that result in an improved ear protection apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by prior art, either alone or in combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To attain this, the ear protection apparatus is provided with both ear protection and eyeglasses together or as ear protection fitted to existing eyeglasses. A plurality of attachment means for attaching ear protection to eyeglasses is provided. A plurality of swivel and pivot planes for ear protection adjustment is provided, in various embodiments. Ear protection may be worn either in front of or behind a user's ears. The flex tubes with memory, used on each side of the temple bars and pads of each embodiment provide for selective shape retention. Sophisticated earplug design provides for fit to virtually any size and shape of ears, without excessive tension placed on the ears.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus has been broadly outlined the more important features of the improved ear protection apparatus so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present apparatus is to provide an ear protection apparatus which removably fits to existing eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the ear protection apparatus is to include eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An added object of the ear protection apparatus is to provide multiple means for attachment to eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the ear protection apparatus is to provide multiple adjustments for fitting the ears of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further object of the ear protection apparatus is to provide for selective movement of earplugs away from a user's ears.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An added object of the ear protection apparatus is to prevent excessive pressure on a user's head while providing ear protection.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">And, an object of the ear protection apparatus is to fit in front of and behind a user's ears.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the improved ear protection apparatus will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments of the improved ear protection apparatus when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the improved ear protection apparatus in detail, it is to be understood that the ear protection apparatus is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the improved ear protection apparatus. It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the ear protection apparatus. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> thereof, the principles and concepts of the ear protection apparatus embodiments generally designated by the reference number <b>10</b>, and more specifically to numbers <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C, <b>10</b>D, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>G, and <b>10</b>H will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, it is important to note that the apparatus <b>10</b> is provided both for fit to existing eyeglasses <b>80</b> or as a combination of ear protection and eyeglasses <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>2</b>, the ear protection apparatus <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B illustrate like components with the exception of the temple members which are comprised of either right temple pad <b>25</b><i>a </i>and left temple pad <b>25</b><i>b </i>or right temple bar <b>20</b><i>a </i>and left temple bar <b>20</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the use of right temple pad <b>25</b><i>a </i>and left temple pad <b>25</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2</figref> illustrate the use of right temple bar <b>20</b><i>a </i>and left temple bar <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The temple members of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>2</b> are attached to a ball and socket <b>55</b>. Each temple member is removably fitted to eyeglasses <b>80</b>, and each temple member is optionally included with the eyeglasses <b>80</b>. Each ball and socket provides 360 of movement between the ball <b>58</b> and the socket <b>56</b>. The ball <b>58</b> is dis-connectable from the socket <b>56</b>. A first swivel <b>50</b><i>a </i>is affixed to each ball and socket <b>55</b>. Each first swivel <b>50</b><i>a </i>has at least 180 degrees of pivot. The important clearance <b>60</b> of about 8 millimeters provided between each first swivel <b>50</b><i>a </i>and each temple member provides for the ball and sockets <b>55</b> to be fitted either in front of or behind a user's ears, depending upon the positioning of various embodiments of the temple members. A flex tube <b>30</b> is affixed to each first swivel <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Each flex tube <b>30</b> provides flexible movement with memory, such that the positional arrangement of each flex tube <b>30</b> is held until changed by a user. An angle member <b>35</b> is affixed to an end of each flex tube <b>30</b> opposite the first swivel <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Each angle member <b>35</b> can rotate 360 degrees about flex tube <b>30</b>. The angle of each angle member <b>35</b> is about 90 degrees, but not relegated to only that, depending upon the embodiment. An earplug <b>40</b> is affixed to each angle member <b>35</b>. Each earplug <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of pliable conical plugs, each conical plug having a diameter. The plugs comprise the third plug <b>40</b><i>c </i>most proximal to the angle member <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second plug <b>40</b><i>b </i>is affixed to the third plug <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The diameter of the second plug <b>40</b><i>b </i>is less than the diameter of the third plug <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The first plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>is affixed to the second plug <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The first plug has a diameter less than the diameter of the second plug <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The earplug <b>40</b> design is important in providing comfortable fit to a variety of ear shapes and sizes, without each earplug <b>40</b> having to be tightly tensioned against an ear.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the embodiment <b>10</b>C illustrates dual swivels which are used on left temple bar <b>20</b><i>b </i>and right temple bar <b>20</b><i>a </i>(not shown).
