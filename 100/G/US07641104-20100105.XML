<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to inventory tracking, and specifically relates to tracking shipped inventory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are currently two main technologies using coded information to track parcels. First, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a new technology that is being adopted by many companies, both shippers and receivers. Currently RFID tags on consumer products usually look like a square or rectangular sticker with a Universal Product Code (UPC) symbol on one side and a coiled wire on the other side. The coiled wire is an antenna that receives radiated power from a scanner, and it uses the power to operate a small chip on the tag. When powered, the chip outputs data written thereon, and the data is transmitted in a radio signal using the antenna. RFID tags simply output a data string (e.g., a unique string of numbers) stored therein when excited by a scanner, and any RFID scanner can usually read the numbers stored to a given tag (although the particular numbers may make sense only to a specific tracking application). Accordingly, the numbers on a RFID tag are nearly universally readable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The second kind of technology used to track parcels is the barcode, which has been used extensively for decades now. Generally, a barcode is a printed pattern that can be scanned with an optical scanner. The pattern of a barcode represents information, as defined by a particular barcode application. For the most part, a barcode scanner from one application cannot read a barcode from another application because different applications typically use different barcode standards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, shipping companies use either or both technologies to track the parcels from pick-up to delivery. Upon delivery and opening of the parcels, a recipient uses its own tracking system to inventory the goods in the parcels. In other words, tracking of the parcel ends at the dock of the recipient, and tracking of the goods begins at the dock. Despite the widespread use of both technologies to track parcels, there is no system currently available to indicate to a recipient on the parcel the receipt of the goods therein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods which tie a shipping label of a parcel to the goods contained in the parcel. According to an exemplary embodiment, a label is created and attached to a parcel before it is shipped. The label includes coded information thereon, and may be, e.g., a barcode tag or RFID tag. Further, the label may be part of the shipping label or separate from the shipping label on the parcel. The label includes coded information thereon that, according to embodiments, when read by the shipper is used in tracking shipment of the parcel and when read by the recipient of the parcel indicates receipt of the goods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example, the shipper writes an inventory number directly to the label, the number being compatible with an inventory system of the recipient. Upon receipt, the recipient scans the label and is able to inventory the goods without opening the parcel and without scanning the goods individually.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, other coded information on the label is linked to the goods. For instance, a package identification number for the parcel that is coded and readable by the recipient is linked to a description of the goods, a number of goods shipped, the inventory number of the goods, the serial number of each of the goods, etcetera. This may be accomplished by sending a message from the shipper to the recipient specifying that particular goods with the inventory number are included in a parcel with the package identification number. The recipient may use the message to cross-reference the package identification number with the inventory number of the goods. Because of the cross-reference explained above, the package identification number, when read by the recipient, indicates receipt of the particular goods included in the package. Upon receipt, the recipient scans the coded information, thereby discovering the package identification number of the parcel. The recipient's system then verifies receipt of the goods based on the scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Using the techniques described above, various embodiments of the present invention marry the shipping system of the parcel shipper to the recipient's goods inventory system. As a result, some embodiments make it possible for a recipient to track inventory using the same shipping label that a shipper used to track the corresponding parcel. Accordingly, a recipient may readily receive shipped goods into the recipient's inventory control system. Because the shipping label provides information to the recipient indicative of the particular goods shipped, rather than just the package shipped, a recipient may receive the goods into the recipient's inventory control system as the package is received and electronically scanned by the recipient. Moreover, because the shipping label provides information to the shipper used in tracking the package, shipping data (e.g., date of shipment, shipping route, shipping carrier, shipping way-points, date of delivery, identification of shipping personnel handling the shipment, identification of receiver personnel receiving the shipment, etcetera) may readily be associated with the individual goods by the receiver. For example, the receiver's inventory control system may interface with the shipper's tracking system to obtain shipping information and store that information in association with the records of the particular goods.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.</p>

Additionally, coded information <b>103</b> of embodiments comprises information readable by a shipper (e.g., vendor) of the goods shipped within parcel <b>104</b>. Coded information <b>103</b> may comprise information and/or a data format, or portion thereof, specified by a shipper and/or recipient to uniquely identify the goods in parcel <b>104</b> to the shipper and/or recipient. Additionally or alternatively, coded information <b>103</b> may comprise information and/or a data format, or portion thereof, specified by a shipper to uniquely identify the parcel to the shipper. Such coded information <b>103</b> may be written to a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag, a barcode, and/or the like, such as by data writing component <b>101</b>. Alternatively, coded information <b>103</b> may comprise unique information, such as an RFID identification number supplied by an RFID tag manufacturer, which is associated with parcel <b>104</b> by a shipping service provider and the particular goods within parcel <b>104</b> by a shipper and/or recipient of parcel <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In traditional systems, a shipping label, such as label <b>102</b>, would include a package identification number coded onto a barcode tag so that a shipping service is able to track a parcel, such as parcel <b>104</b>, by scanning the barcode tag at various points along the parcel's route. In those traditional systems, the package identification number is written in a format that is usually not readable by the recipient or is otherwise meaningless to the recipient. Further in traditional systems, the shipping label includes no informational content that may be used to provide an indication about the goods themselves, as the shipping label only describes the parcel. However, in system <b>100</b>, coded information <b>103</b> is readable by the recipient and includes information that indicates receipt of the goods in parcel <b>104</b>, as explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to embodiments of the invention, information <b>103</b> as read by a shipping service provider may be utilized in tracking the shipment of parcel <b>104</b>, such as to create a detailed shipping record including date of shipment, shipping route, shipping carrier, shipping way-points, date of delivery, identification of shipping personnel handling the shipment, identification of receiver personnel receiving the shipment, etcetera. Information <b>103</b> as read by a receiver of parcel <b>104</b> may be used to indicate receipt of the particular goods contained in the parcel by the recipient, such as to populate or update the recipient's inventory control system. Moreover, the receiver's inventory control system may interface with the shipper's tracking system to obtain shipping information and store that information in association with the records of the particular goods.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of exemplary parcel <b>104</b> for shipping goods, adapted according to at least one embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides a more detailed view of parcel <b>104</b>, coded information <b>103</b>, and shipping label <b>102</b> of embodiments of the invention. Shipping label <b>102</b> of the illustrated embodiment is adhesively attached to parcel <b>104</b> to provide destination information and package identification information to the shipping service provider during the shipping and delivery process. Coded information <b>103</b> may provide destination and identification information easily accessible through use of a scanning mechanism. For instance, coded information <b>103</b> may be printed in a barcode, as in <b>103</b><i>a</i>, or may be programmed into a RFID tag, as shown in <b>103</b><i>b</i>. Appropriate scanners can then quickly decode the information and present it to a user, update a database, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Coded information <b>103</b> of embodiments includes information that can be read by the recipient of parcel <b>104</b>, and such information indicates receipt of the goods when read by the recipient. In one example, barcode <b>103</b><i>a </i>is written in a format that is compatible with the recipient's intake and/or inventory system so that the recipient may use its existing scanning hardware and software to read information <b>103</b>. In another example, such information is programmed into RFID tag <b>103</b><i>b</i>, which may be read by most or all RFID readers available on the market. The invention is not limited to barcodes and RFID tags, as any other technique now known or later developed to write coded information to parcel <b>104</b> may be used as long as it is at least partially readable by the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Not only is coded information <b>103</b> readable by the recipient, but it also indicates receipt of the particular goods contained within parcel <b>104</b> when read by the recipient according to embodiments of the invention. For example, coded information <b>103</b> may contain or correspond to, among other things, a description of the goods, a number of goods shipped, the inventory number of the goods, the serial number of each of the goods, etcetera useful according to the recipient's intake/inventory system. Thus, when the recipient scans coded information <b>103</b>, the intake/inventory system recognizes the numbers and updates the recipient's system to show receipt of the goods.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to embodiments, coded information <b>103</b> serves the dual purposes of being information for the shipping service and information for the recipient. For example, coded information <b>103</b> may include or correspond to a package identifier for the shipping service to scan and use in tracking parcel <b>104</b>. The package identifier may be linked to inventory numbers identifying the goods in the recipient's intake/inventory system through a database, such that when the recipient scans the shipping label, the intake/inventory system searches for the package identification number in the database, recognizes that it is associated with uniquely identified goods, and verifies receipt of the goods. Accordingly, information that is usually only used by the shipping service may also be used to indicate receipt of goods when read by the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The examples above help to illustrate the difference between information that describes a parcel and information that describes the goods carried in the parcel. Traditional shipping services have heretofore not used coded information on a parcel to uniquely identify goods in a format that can be read and understood by recipients. Various embodiments of the present invention provide such a feature directly, e.g., by including recipient inventory numbers or other information identifying the goods to the recipient on the parcel, or indirectly, e.g., by linking other information to recipient inventory numbers or other information identifying the goods to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In traditional systems, manufacturers of goods have placed RFID tags directly onto the goods before shipping so that recipients may scan the goods into an inventory system upon receipt. However, such a system has disadvantages. For example, once the goods leave the parcel, delivery information regarding the goods is often lost unless the recipient actively links package numbers and identification of goods before the parcel is discarded. In various embodiments of the present invention, such linking is performed with assistance from the shipper or shipping service, thereby relieving the recipient from some administrative burden. It should be noted that various embodiments of the present invention do not preclude the use of manufacturer-supplied RFID tags on goods.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, various embodiments of the present invention allow a recipient to verify delivery of both the parcel and the goods using one scanning system, whereas such traditional system require one scanning system for the goods and provide no scanning system at all for the parcel, since traditional systems usually have no coded information that may be read and understood by the recipient. Further, various embodiments of the present invention may allow for closer and more coherent cooperation between and shipper/shipping service and recipient since both parties may track the parcel and goods.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of exemplary system <b>300</b> for shipping goods, adapted according to at least one embodiment of the invention. In system <b>300</b>, shipper <b>301</b> sends goods to recipient <b>302</b> using parcel <b>104</b> with label <b>102</b> and coded information <b>103</b>. Shipper <b>301</b> and recipient <b>302</b> communicate via network <b>303</b>, which may be a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) a wireless network (e.g., cellular network), or a computer network, such as a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), the Internet, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Shipper <b>301</b>, in this example, has a data writing component (e.g., data writing component <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to apply postage to parcel <b>104</b> by printing shipping label <b>102</b>. Shipping label <b>102</b> includes coded information <b>103</b> that is readable by recipient <b>302</b> and indicates receipt of the goods when read by recipient <b>302</b>. Data writing component <b>101</b> may include a printer, programmer, etcetera that can write coded information <b>103</b>, such as by printing barcodes and/or programming RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When shipper <b>301</b> is ready to ship the goods to recipient <b>302</b>, shipper <b>301</b> prepares parcel <b>104</b> and prints shipping label <b>102</b>. In an embodiment wherein coded information <b>103</b> includes an inventory number of the goods according to an inventory system of recipient <b>302</b>, such inventory number may be directly written into coded information <b>103</b>. Recipient <b>302</b> may send a message to shipper <b>301</b> via network <b>303</b> before shipping to inform shipper <b>301</b> of the inventory numbers to be used to identify the goods in parcel <b>104</b>. Shipper <b>301</b> then ships parcel <b>104</b> to recipient <b>302</b> with coded information <b>103</b> written to shipping label <b>102</b>. Upon receipt, recipient <b>302</b> scans shipping label <b>102</b> and decodes coded information <b>103</b>, thereby reading the inventory numbers and verifying receipt of the uniquely-identified goods.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment wherein coded information <b>103</b> is linked to inventory numbers of the goods, recipient <b>302</b> may send a message to shipper <b>301</b> before shipment of the goods informing shipper <b>301</b> of the inventory numbers to use for the goods. Shipper <b>301</b> then prints label <b>102</b> with coded information <b>103</b> and sends parcel <b>104</b> to recipient <b>302</b> via a parcel service. Before, during, or after shipping, and most likely before an expected delivery time of parcel <b>104</b>, shipper <b>301</b> sends a message to recipient <b>302</b> via network <b>303</b> that links coded information <b>103</b> with information identifying the goods. For example, the message may indicate that package &#x201c;1286983&#x201d; includes widget &#x201c;324X&#x201d; and widget &#x201c;325X,&#x201d; wherein &#x201c;1286983&#x201d; is the package identification number of parcel <b>104</b>, and the widget numbers are numbers compatible with an inventory system of recipient <b>302</b>. The message may be an email, a document over File Transfer Protocol (FTP), an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) message, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As a result of the message, the package identification number indicates receipt of the widgets when it is read by recipient <b>302</b>. In this example, the inventory system of recipient <b>302</b> automatically cross-references the package identification number and the widget numbers upon receiving the message, such that upon scanning the package identification number, the inventory system recognizes that parcel <b>104</b> includes the identified widgets. Recipient <b>302</b> then receives parcel <b>104</b>, decodes coded information <b>103</b>, and updates the inventory system database to reflect that the goods have been received. In any embodiment described above, it is possible for recipient <b>302</b> to send a confirmation message to shipper <b>301</b> via network <b>303</b> so that shipper <b>301</b> can update its own records.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> describes an embodiment wherein coded information <b>103</b> indicates receipt of more than one piece of merchandise (e.g., two widgets). Various embodiments are able to provide coded information readable by a recipient to indicate receipt of any number of separate pieces of merchandise. While a linking message embodiment (as described above) may in some instances be preferable to directly writing inventory numbers in coded information <b>103</b> when the number of separate pieces of merchandise exceeds one, barcode and RFID products that are scalable to include more information may be developed and used with various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, coded information <b>103</b> may be in the form of an RFID tag. Such an embodiment may provide the advantage of being scannable from a small distance and not requiring line-of site scanning. Further, most RFID tags are readable by any RFID scanner on the market, so that a shipper and recipient may use disparate hardware to read the same tags.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an alternate embodiment, coded information <b>103</b> may be written to a second bar code in addition to any package identification barcode, where the second barcode is in a format of the recipient's inventory tracking format. This may require a shipper to specifically know which program the recipient uses to scan barcodes, since different barcode formats are usually not compatible. In yet another alternate embodiment, the shipper may add a front-end portion of code in a barcode tag or RFID tag that allows the user's system to properly read a given barcode format on a shipping label by converting the information thereon to information usable by its internal systems.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates exemplary method <b>400</b> that may be performed by a shipper of goods, such as a manufacturer, a wholesaler, a parcel shipping company, or any other entity that may send parcels to a recipient, the method adapted according to at least one embodiment. In step <b>401</b>, the shipper provides a coded information tag and a parcel to be shipped, the parcel including merchandise for delivery to a recipient. The coded information tag may be a barcode tag, a RFID tag, or any other coded information tag now known or later developed. Further, the coded information tag be the same as a shipping label, a part of the shipping label, or separate from the shipping label.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>402</b>, the shipper writes information to the coded information tag in a format readable by the recipient, the information indicating receipt of the goods when read by the recipient. The writing may be performed by a data writing component, such as a printer, and, in fact, may be a printer that is part of a franking system operable to store and apply postage and other parcel delivery indicia to parcels. The printer may also be operable to program and verify RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example embodiment, the information is one or more numbers compatible with an inventory system of the recipient written directly to, e.g., a barcode tag or RFID tag, which the recipient can read. In another example, readable content on the tag, such as a package identification number, can be linked to inventory numbers for the goods, the inventory numbers being compatible with the recipient's inventory system. Such linking may include cross-referencing a database of the recipient to associate the readable content with the inventory numbers in response to receiving a message from the shipper. Other techniques exist and are within the scope of various embodiments, as long as those techniques provide readable coded content to the parcel that indicates receipt of goods when read by a recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>403</b>, the shipper associates the coded information tag with the parcel. The shipper may, for example, adhesively attach a shipping label or manifest containing the coded information to the parcel. In another example, the shipper may print the coded information directly on the surface of the parcel. Various embodiments are not limited by manner of associating the coded information tag with the parcel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>404</b>, the shipper sends the parcel and the coded information tag to the recipient. For example, the shipper may be a private entity that deposits the parcel with a shipping service. In another example, the shipper is a parcel service that inserts the parcel into its delivery processes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates exemplary method <b>500</b> that may be performed by a recipient of goods, such a warehouser, a retailer, or any other entity that may receive parcels, the method adapted according to at least one embodiment. In step <b>501</b>, the recipient receives a message linking coded information on a parcel to goods to be tracked in an internal inventory system. For example, the message may be sent from a shipper before delivery of the goods to allow the recipient to cross reference the coded information to the goods in a database of the internal inventory system. The message may be the same or similar to the message described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step <b>502</b>, the recipient receives the parcel including the goods, the parcel further including the coded information. The coded information may be, for example, the shipping label, part of the shipping label, or separate from the shipping label. The coded information may be written to a barcode label, a RFID label, or any other coded information delivery mechanism now known or later developed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>503</b>, the recipient decodes the coded information. For example, the recipient may scan a barcode with an optical scanner or scan a RFID tag with an RFID reader. The scanner or reader then converts the coded information into a format usable by, e.g., a database in the recipient's inventory system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>504</b>, the recipient, based on the decoding, updates a database in the internal inventory system to show receipt of the goods. In this manner, the recipient uses readable coded data on the parcel to identify and inventory the goods in the parcel. In effect, this example embodiment extends the life of the shipping label beyond mere delivery to at least the first inventory step for goods.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While method <b>500</b> describes an exemplary embodiment wherein the coded data is linked to the goods through use of a message from the shipper to the recipient, other embodiments are within the scope of the invention. For example, in another embodiment, the linking is performed in a shared database that is internal to neither the shipper nor the recipient, e.g., is hosted by a third party. In such a case, the coded data and the goods may be linked by a message sent to the hosting party. The invention is not limited to any particular method of linking coded information on the parcel to goods inside the parcel. Further, some other example embodiments include data identifying the goods directly, by e.g. inventory serial number, on the parcel, such that there is no need to link the coded data to the goods. Such an example embodiment is described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Various embodiments of the invention are not limited to the flows of methods <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>. In fact, steps may be added, deleted, or rearranged in methods <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> while still remaining within the scope of the invention. For instance, method <b>400</b> may include receiving a message from the recipient describing particular inventory numbers to use for certain pieces of merchandise. Additionally, method <b>500</b> may further include sending a confirmation message to the shipper when the parcel is received.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In yet another example, the shipper uses the label to track the parcel. The recipient then uses the coded information in the label to download the history of the goods contained in the parcel. This may be especially helpful when the goods are damaged or late, allowing the user to scrutinize shipment as a possible cause. For instance, if temperature-sensitive goods are damaged, the recipient may check the history and see that the goods were shipped trough an area with a climate that is too cold or too warm. The recipient might then be able to request alternate shipping routes for future deliveries.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates exemplary method <b>600</b> that may be performed to track a parcel and its corresponding inventory, the method adapted according to at least one embodiment of the invention. As mentioned above, some embodiments may make it possible for a recipient to track its inventory using the same label that the shipping service provided uses to track the parcel. Such an example is described in method <b>600</b>. In this example, the parcel includes coded informational content. In step <b>601</b> a shipping service provider tracks the parcel along a shipping route between a sender and a recipient using at least some of the coded informational content on the parcel. For instance, the coded informational content may be a package identification number or other shipping information on a shipping label written to a barcode or RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step <b>602</b>, the recipient tracks the inventory using at least some of the coded informational content on the parcel. For instance, the recipient may use the same package identification number or other shipping information on the shipping label to track the inventory. In such an embodiment, the package identification number or other shipping information may be linked to one or more inventory numbers in the recipient's tracking system, such as, for example, by an email or other message making the association between the shipping information and the one or more inventory numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantages of some embodiments of the present invention include allowing a customer to scan in a parcel and its goods in one short step, rather than having to enter parcel data and merchandise data in two or more steps. Further, the recipient does not need to open the package or to infer the contents based on a sender address to discover what the parcel holds. Further, embodiments that employ RFID technology to write coded data leverage the rapid spread, near universal readability, and low cost of this convenient tracking technology. Still further, while current traditional recipient inventory systems allow tracking of merchandise only when the box is opened, various embodiments of the invention allow merchandise tracking (in addition to parcel tracking) to reach back to the sender.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification.
