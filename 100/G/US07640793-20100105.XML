<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Systems and methods for determining airflow parameters of gas turbine engine components are provided, several exemplary embodiments of which will be described. In this regard, repair of gas turbine engine components is a technically challenging task that can be made even more difficult when expected operating characteristics of the components are not readily available. By way of example, a component such as a turbine vane can be restored to desired dimensional characteristics but information regarding airflow parameters of the turbine vane may not be known to those performing the repair. Notably, some embodiments can be used to acquire information corresponding to such airflow parameters, thereby facilitating proper repair of the component. In some embodiments, acquisition of such information is facilitated by a distributed network of test sites that can be used to acquire information regarding the same or different components. The information from the distributed network of test sites then can be compiled and analyzed so that nominal airflow parameters can be established for each component that is to be repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now in greater detail to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram depicting an exemplary embodiment of a system for determining airflow parameters of gas turbine engine components. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> includes an airflow analysis system <b>110</b> that is configured to receive information from one or more airflow test systems. In particular, system <b>100</b> includes airflow test systems <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, each of which is configured to communicate information to the airflow analysis system via communication network <b>120</b>. Notably, network <b>120</b> can comprise one or more of various network types, such as wired networks, wireless networks, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), virtual private networks (VPNs) and the Internet, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In operation, a component <b>130</b> is tested by one or more of the test systems to determine one or more airflow parameters associated with the component. For instance the component can be either an un-repaired component or a repaired component (in which case information can be used to determine repair effectiveness, among other characteristics). By way of example, the component can be tested to determine a volumetric flow rate of cooling air that is provided to the component during engine operation. Notably, the cooling air can be used for film cooling the component.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this regard, a test system can be configured to perform one or more of various tests, such as flow parameter and pressure ratio checks, for example. Notably, with respect to determining parameters associated with cooling airflow, an airflow test bench (e.g., test bench <b>132</b>) can be used. Generally, such a test bench can include an airflow supply, analytical software, instrumentation and a tooling fixture that are employed to obtain information regarding the airflow parameters of a component.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Information regarding the airflow parameters is provided to the airflow analysis system for storage and analysis. Notably, the information can be stored in one or more of various formats, e.g., in a database format.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Using one or more analysis techniques, values useful for a repair operation can be calculated. Specifically, such values can include, but are not limited to, nominal values for one or more operating parameters, limit values for one or more operating parameters, and tolerance values. Once established, these values can be used during repair of a component similar to the component about which the information was acquired. It should be noted that calculated values can be revised based on later-acquired information. Thus, responsive to receipt of additional information corresponding to a component, one or more values can be adjusted based, at least in part, on this information. By way of example, additional information can be used to verify cooling hole size, location, angles and airflow necessary to ensure a sufficiently durable component.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart depicting functionality of system <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the functionality (or method) may be construed as beginning at block <b>202</b>, in which information from a first test system and corresponding to a first airflow parameter of a gas turbine engine component is received. In block <b>204</b>, information is received from a second test system. Notably, this information corresponds to the first airflow parameter of the component. Then, as depicted in block <b>206</b>, a nominal value for the first airflow parameter is established based, at least in part, on the information provided by the first and second test systems.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart depicting functionality of an embodiment of an airflow analysis system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the functionality (or method) may be construed as beginning at block <b>302</b>, in which information is received from multiple test systems. Specifically, the information corresponds to one or more airflow parameters of one or more gas turbine engine components. In this regard, multiple ones of the test systems could test the same component, in which case differences in the acquired information can be evaluated to determine remote system validity (such as in reference to system <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example). Additionally or alternatively, similar components (e.g., components of the same part number) can be evaluated by one or more of the test systems, in which case a nominal value(s) and tolerance value(s) for that component type can be established. In block <b>304</b>, the information is used to establish one or more desired performance parameters that are to be exhibited by a repaired component. In some embodiments, the desired cooling necessary for engine operating environment can be determined. Additionally or alternatively, the information can assist in prescribing a flow method for the specific gas turbine component to follow during a repair process.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various functionality, such as that described above in the flowcharts, can be implemented in hardware and/or software. In this regard, a computing device can be used to implement various functionality, such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In terms of hardware architecture, such a computing device can include a processor, memory, and one or more input and/or output (I/O) device interface(s) that are communicatively coupled via a local interface. The local interface can include, for example but not limited to, one or more buses and/or other wired or wireless connections. The local interface may have additional elements, which are omitted for simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers, repeaters, and receivers to enable communications. Further, the local interface may include address, control, and/or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The processor may be a hardware device for executing software, particularly software stored in memory. The processor can be a custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the computing device, a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set) or generally any device for executing software instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The memory can include any one or combination of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, VRAM, etc.)) and/or nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CD-ROM, etc.). Moreover, the memory may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and/or other types of storage media. Note that the memory can also have a distributed architecture, where various components are situated remotely from one another, but can be accessed by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The software in the memory may include one or more separate programs, each of which includes an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. A system component embodied as software may also be construed as a source program, executable program (object code), script, or any other entity comprising a set of instructions to be performed. When constructed as a source program, the program is translated via a compiler, assembler, interpreter, or the like, which may or may not be included within the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The Input/Output devices that may be coupled to system I/O Interface(s) may include input devices, for example but not limited to, a keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, camera, proximity device, etc. Further, the Input/Output devices may also include output devices, for example but not limited to, a printer, display, etc. Finally, the Input/Output devices may further include devices that communicate both as inputs and outputs, for instance but not limited to, a modulator/demodulator (modem; for accessing another device, system, or network), a radio frequency (RF) or other transceiver, a telephonic interface, a bridge, a router, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the computing device is in operation, the processor can be configured to execute software stored within the memory, to communicate data to and from the memory, and to generally control operations of the computing device pursuant to the software. Software in memory, in whole or in part, is read by the processor, perhaps buffered within the processor, and then executed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One should note that the flowcharts included herein show the architecture, functionality, and operation of a possible implementation of software. In this regard, each block can be interpreted to represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order and/or not at all. For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One should note that any of the functionality described herein can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; contains, stores, communicates, propagates and/or transports the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive list) of a computer-readable medium include a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (electronic), a read-only memory (ROM) (electronic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of this disclosure. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing substantially from the spirit and principles of the disclosure. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and protected by the accompanying claims.</p>
