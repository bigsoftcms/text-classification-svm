<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Some internal combustion engines utilize boosting devices such as turbochargers to increase the mass airflow through the engine, thereby enabling an increase of the work output of the engine. As one example, an engine may utilize twin turbochargers in separate parallel branches of the engine's air intake system to provide increased boost to the engine. One issue with twin turbocharged engines is that the amount of airflow provided by each of the turbochargers may become unbalanced. For example, degradation or failure of a turbocharger or other component of the exhaust system or variations in engine system components may cause one of the turbochargers to provide a larger portion of the total airflow to the engine than the other turbocharger. Thus, under these conditions, the engine system may generate noise and vibration harshness (NVH), experience reduced fuel efficiency, and/or the lower airflow turbocharger may experience compressor surge and may be damaged due to the imbalance of airflow provided by each turbocharger.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some approaches aimed at addressing this issue have utilized a mass airflow sensor in each branch of the air intake system to reduce airflow imbalances resulting from imbalances in turbocharger operation. However, the inventors of the present application have identified some further issues with this approach. Specifically, the use of and reliance on separate mass airflow sensors in each air intake branch can add cost and complexity to the engine system. Further, failure or degradation of one of the mass airflow sensors can impair the ability to balance the airflow through each branch of the air intake passage.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As one example, the above issues may be addressed by a method of operating an engine system including a first air intake passage branch including a first compression device and a second air intake passage branch including a second compression device, wherein each of the first branch and the second branch are fluidly coupled to at least a combustion chamber the engine via a common intake passage, a first sensor arranged along the first branch and at least a second sensor arranged along the common intake passage, wherein the first sensor is a mass airflow sensor and wherein the second branch does not include a mass airflow sensor, the method, comprising increasing the mass airflow through the first branch relative to the mass airflow through the second branch when an amount of decrease in the mass airflow through the first branch is more than half an amount of a corresponding decrease in the combined mass airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the combination of sensor outputs from a mass airflow sensor of only one of the two branches and an output from one or more sensors arranged in a combined flow region of the intake system can be used to identify imbalance between the two branches. In this way, an imbalance in mass airflow between two branches of an engine intake system, which may be caused, for example, by variations in compressor speed, can be reduced by the engine controller, while eliminating the need for a second mass airflow sensor in each branch of the air intake system.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic depiction of an example engine system <b>100</b> including a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine <b>110</b> and twin turbochargers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>. As one non-limiting example, engine system <b>100</b> can be included as part of a propulsion system for a passenger vehicle. Engine system <b>100</b> can receive intake air via intake passage <b>140</b>. Intake passage <b>140</b> can include an air filter <b>156</b>. At least a portion of the intake air (MAF_<b>1</b>) can be directed to a compression device or compressor <b>122</b> of turbocharger <b>120</b> via a first branch of the intake passage <b>140</b> as indicated at <b>142</b> and at least a portion of the intake air (MAF_<b>2</b>) can be directed to a compressor <b>132</b> of turbocharger <b>130</b> via a second branch of the intake passage <b>140</b> as indicated at <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first portion of the total intake air (MAF_<b>1</b>) can be compressed via compressor <b>122</b> where it may be supplied to intake manifold <b>160</b> via intake air passage <b>146</b>. Thus, intake passages <b>142</b> and <b>146</b> form a first branch of the engine's air intake system. Similarly, a second portion of the total intake air (MAF_<b>2</b>) can be compressed via compressor <b>132</b> where it may be supplied to intake manifold <b>160</b> via intake air passage <b>148</b>. Thus, intake passages <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> form a second branch of the engine's air intake system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, intake air from intake passages <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> can be recombined via a common intake passage <b>149</b> before reaching intake manifold <b>160</b>. In some examples, intake manifold <b>160</b> may include an intake manifold pressure sensor <b>182</b> and/or an intake manifold temperature sensor <b>183</b>, each communicating with control system <b>190</b>. Intake passage <b>149</b> can include an air cooler <b>154</b> and/or a throttle <b>158</b>. The position of the throttle can be adjusted by the control system via a throttle actuator <b>157</b> communicatively coupled to control system <b>190</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an anti-surge valve <b>152</b> may be provided to selectively bypass turbochargers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> via bypass passage <b>150</b>. As one example, anti-surge valve <b>152</b> can open to enable flow through bypass passage <b>150</b> where the intake air pressure of the combined air flow attains a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Engine <b>110</b> may include a plurality of cylinders two of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B. Note that in some examples, engine <b>110</b> can include more than two cylinders such as 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or more cylinders. Cylinders <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B may be identical in some examples and include identical components. As such, only cylinder <b>20</b>A will be described in detail. Cylinder <b>20</b>A includes a combustion chamber <b>22</b>A defined by combustion chamber walls <b>24</b>A. A piston <b>30</b>A is disposed within combustion chamber <b>22</b>A and is coupled to a crank shaft <b>34</b> via a crank arm <b>32</b>A. Crank shaft <b>34</b> may include an engine speed sensor <b>181</b> that can identify the rotational speed of crank shaft <b>34</b>. Engine speed sensor <b>181</b> can communicate with control system <b>190</b> to enable a determination of engine speed. Cylinder <b>20</b>A can include a spark plug <b>70</b>A for delivering an ignition spark to combustion chamber <b>22</b>A. However, in some examples, spark plug <b>70</b>A may be omitted, for example, where engine <b>110</b> is configured to provide combustion via compression ignition. Combustion chamber <b>22</b>A may include a fuel injector <b>60</b>A, which in this example is configured as a port based fuel injector. However, in some examples, fuel injector <b>60</b>A can be configured as a direct in-cylinder injector.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Cylinder <b>20</b>A can further include at least one intake valve <b>40</b>A actuated via an intake valve actuator <b>42</b>A and at least one exhaust valve <b>50</b>A actuated via an exhaust valve actuator <b>52</b>A. Cylinder <b>20</b>A can include two or more intake valves and/or two or more exhaust valves along with associated valve actuators. In this particular example, actuators <b>42</b>A and <b>52</b>A are configured as cam actuators, however, in other examples, electromagnetic valve actuators may be utilized. Intake valve actuator <b>42</b>A can be operated to open and close intake valve <b>40</b>A to admit intake air into combustion chamber <b>22</b>A via intake passage <b>162</b> communicating with intake manifold <b>160</b>. Similarly, exhaust valve actuator <b>52</b>A can be operated to open and close exhaust valve <b>50</b>A to exhaust products of combustion from combustion chamber <b>22</b>A into exhaust passage <b>166</b>. In this way, intake air may be supplied to combustion chamber <b>22</b>A via intake passage <b>162</b> and products of combustion may be exhausted from combustion chamber <b>22</b>A via exhaust passage <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be appreciated that cylinder <b>20</b>B or other cylinders of engine <b>110</b> can include the same or similar components of cylinder <b>20</b>A as described above. Thus, intake air may be supplied to combustion chamber <b>22</b>B via intake passage <b>164</b> and products of combustion may be exhausted from combustion chamber <b>22</b>B via exhaust passage <b>168</b>. Note that in some examples a first bank of cylinders of engine <b>110</b> including cylinder <b>22</b>A as well as other cylinders can exhaust products of combustion via a common exhaust passage <b>166</b> and a second bank of cylinders including cylinder <b>22</b>B as well as other cylinders can exhaust products of combustion via a common exhaust passage <b>168</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, exhaust turbines <b>124</b> and <b>134</b> may be configured as variable geometry turbines, whereby associated actuators <b>125</b> and <b>135</b> may be used to adjust the position of the turbine impeller blades to vary the level of energy that is obtained from the exhaust gas flow and imparted to their respective compressor. For example, the control system can be configured to independently vary the geometry of the exhaust gas turbines <b>124</b> and <b>134</b> via their respective actuators <b>125</b> and <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Products of combustion exhaust by one or more cylinders via exhaust passage <b>166</b> can be directed to ambient via exhaust passage <b>170</b>. Exhaust passage <b>170</b> may include an exhaust aftertreatment device such as catalyst <b>174</b>, and one or more exhaust gas sensors indicated at <b>184</b> and <b>185</b>, for example. Similarly, products of combustion exhaust by one or more cylinders via exhaust passage <b>168</b> can be directed to ambient via exhaust passage <b>172</b>. Exhaust passage <b>172</b> may include an exhaust aftertreatment device such as catalyst <b>176</b>, and one or more exhaust gas sensors indicated at <b>186</b> and <b>187</b>, for example. Exhaust gas sensors <b>184</b>, <b>185</b>, <b>186</b>, and/or <b>187</b> can communicate with control system <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Engine system <b>100</b> can include various other sensors. For example, at least one of intake passages <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> can include a mass air flow sensor. A mass airflow sensor may include, as one example, a hot wire anemometer or other suitable device for measuring mass flow rate of the intake air. As one particular example, a first intake passage branch <b>142</b> includes a mass air flow sensor <b>180</b> arranged upstream of compressor <b>122</b> while a second intake passage branch <b>144</b> does not include a mass air flow sensor. As another example, mass air flow sensor <b>180</b> may be alternatively arranged along intake passage <b>144</b> upstream of compressor <b>132</b> and may be omitted from intake passage <b>142</b>. As another example, mass air flow sensor <b>180</b> may be arranged along intake passage <b>146</b> downstream of compressor <b>122</b>. As yet another example, mass air flow sensor <b>180</b> may be arranged along intake passage <b>148</b> downstream of compressor <b>132</b>. However, in some example, the rate of degradation of the mass airflow sensor may be greater when the sensor is arranged downstream of a compressor as compared to when it is arranged upstream of the compressor since oil contaminants can be ejected by the compressor into the airstream. Thus, as described herein, in at least some examples, engine system <b>100</b> includes an asymmetric arrangement whereby a mass air flow sensor is arranged in only one branch of the engine's intake system. Regardless of the particular configuration, mass airflow sensor <b>180</b> can communicate with control system <b>190</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Control system <b>190</b> can include one or more controllers configured to communicate with the various sensors and actuators described herein. As one example, control system <b>190</b> can include at least one electronic controller comprising one or more of the following: an input/output interface for sending and receive electronic signals with the various sensors and actuators, a central processing unit, memory such as random accessible memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), keep alive memory (KAM), each of which can communicate via a data bus. Control system <b>190</b> may include a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller in some examples. However, it should be appreciated that other suitable controllers may be used as can be appreciated by one skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Control system <b>190</b> can be configured to vary one or more operating parameters of the engine on an individual cylinder basis. For example, the control system can adjust valve timing by utilizing a variable cam timing (VCT) actuator, spark timing by varying the time at which the spark signal is provided to the spark plug, and/or fuel injection timing and amount by varying the pulse width of the fuel injection signal that is provided to the fuel injector by the control system as will also be appreciated in light of the present disclosure. Thus, the spark timing, valve timing, and fuel injection timing can be actuated by the control system as will be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a non-limiting example of an engine system including twin turbochargers including an asymmetrically arranged mass airflow sensor. As will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the mass airflow through each branch of the intake passage can be determined without requiring a mass airflow sensor to be arranged in each of the branches. In this way, a mass airflow sensor can be omitted from engine system <b>100</b>, thereby enabling a reduction in cost. Alternatively, where each branch of the intake passage includes a mass airflow sensor, the approaches described herein can be implemented to identify the mass airflow in each of the intake branches where there is a failure or degradation of one of the mass airflow sensors. Further, the approaches described herein can be used to diagnose whether one of two mass airflow sensors has degraded or failed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flow chart depicting an example approach for identifying mass airflow through each branch of the air intake system and hence the mass airflow through each turbocharger of the engine system. At <b>210</b>, the mass airflow (MAF_<b>1</b>) through a first branch of the engine's air intake system may be identified via a mass airflow sensor. As one example, sensor <b>180</b> arranged in one of the air intake branches may be used to identify the mass airflow through its respective branch. For example, mass airflow sensor <b>180</b> can be used by control system <b>190</b> to determine the mass airflow through a first branch of the engine system comprising intake passage <b>142</b>, compressor <b>122</b>, and intake passage <b>146</b>, whereby the mass airflow sensor is arranged along one of intake passages <b>142</b> or <b>146</b>. As another example, mass airflow sensor <b>180</b> can be used by control system <b>190</b> to determine the mass airflow through the other branch of the engine's intake system comprising intake passage <b>144</b>, compressor <b>132</b>, and intake passage <b>148</b>, whereby the mass airflow sensor is instead arranged along one of intake passage <b>144</b> or <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>220</b>, the total or combined mass airflow (MAF_Total) to the engine may be identified by using one or more of a speed-density or speed-throttle based approaches. As one example, the control system can utilize the speed-density based approach to identify the total mass airflow to the engine by identifying the pressure of the intake air within the intake manifold via intake manifold pressure sensor <b>182</b>, the temperature of the intake air within the intake manifold via intake manifold temperature sensor <b>183</b>, and the speed of the engine via engine speed sensor <b>181</b>. As another example, the control system can utilize the speed-throttle based approach to identify the total mass airflow to the engine by identifying the position of throttle <b>158</b> via throttle position sensor <b>157</b> and the speed of the engine via engine speed sensor <b>181</b>. As yet another example, the control system can utilize an additional mass airflow sensor arranged within the intake passage or intake manifold downstream of where the airflow through the first and second branches are recombined. In this way, the total mass airflow to the engine may be identified by the control system by utilizing a combination of intake manifold pressure, engine speed, intake manifold temperature, and/or throttle position. As one example, the control system may reference a look-up table or engine map stored in memory to identify the total mass airflow responsive to intake manifold pressure, intake manifold temperature, engine speed, and/or throttle position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At <b>230</b>, the mass airflow through the second branch of the engine's intake air system may be determined as the difference between the total mass airflow identified at <b>220</b> and the airflow through the first branch of the intake system identified at <b>210</b>, since the total mass airflow to the engine is based upon the summation of the mass airflows provided by both the first and second branches. As one example, the control system may determine the mass flow through the second branch of the engine's intake air system as MAF_<b>2</b> based upon the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>2=<i>MAF</i>_Total&#x2212;<i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>240</b>, the difference between the mass airflow through the first branch and the mass airflow through the second branch of the engine's air intake system may be determined. As one example, the control system may determine the mass airflow difference as MAF_Imbalance based upon one of the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>MAF</i>_Imbalance=<i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>1&#x2212;<i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>2 or <i>MAF</i>_Imbalance=<i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>2&#x2212;<i>MAF</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As indicated at <b>250</b>, if the mass airflow difference (MAF_Imbalance) is less than a prescribed mass airflow difference threshold (MAF_Threshold) then the routine may return to <b>210</b> where subsequent monitoring of the mass airflow difference between the different branches of the engine's air intake system may be performed by the control system. Alternatively, if the mass airflow difference (MAF_Imbalance) is not less than the prescribed mass airflow difference threshold (MAF_Threshold) then the routine may proceed to <b>260</b>. It should be appreciated that the control system can identify not only the magnitude of the imbalance, but also which of MAF_<b>1</b> and MAF_<b>2</b> is greater. As one example, the control system can be configured with a setpoint value or group of setpoint values representing (MAF_Threshold) against which the mass airflow difference (MAF_Imbalance) is compared. In some examples, MAF_Threshold may vary with operating conditions of the engine. MAF_Threshold can be assigned by the control system to be a function of the total mass airflow to the engine. For example, MAF_Threshold may be based upon a fractional difference or ratio between MAF_<b>1</b> and MAF_<b>2</b>. In other examples, MAF_Threshold may be constant across a variety of operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>260</b>, corrective action may be taken to reduce the mass airflow difference (MAF_Imbalance) to less than the difference threshold (MAF_Threshold). For example, the control system can increase the mass airflow through the first branch relative to the mass airflow through the second branch when an amount of decrease in the mass airflow through the first branch is more than half an amount of a corresponding decrease in the combined mass airflow. The mass airflow through the first branch can be increased relative to the mass airflow through the second branch by increasing only the mass airflow through the first branch, decreasing only the mass airflow through the second branch, both increasing the mass airflow through the first branch and decreasing the mass airflow through the second branch, increasing the mass airflow through the first branch to a greater extent than an increase in the mass airflow through the second branch, or reducing the mass airflow through the second branch to a greater extent than a decrease in the mass airflow through the first branch. However, where a constant combined airflow of the first and the second branches is to be maintained, the control system can increase the airflow through the first branch relative to the second branch by increasing the mass airflow through the first branch by an amount that is equal to a reduction in the mass airflow through the second branch.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As another example, the control system can reduce the mass airflow through the first branch relative to the mass airflow through the second branch when an amount of increase in the mass airflow through the first branch is more than half an amount of a corresponding increase in the combined mass airflow. The mass airflow through the first branch can be reduced relative to the mass airflow through the second branch by reducing only the mass airflow through the first branch, increasing only the mass airflow through the second branch, both reducing the mass airflow through the first branch and increasing the mass airflow through the second branch, reducing the mass airflow through the first branch to a greater extent than a reduction in the mass airflow through the second branch, or increasing the mass airflow through the second branch to a greater extent than an increase in the mass airflow through the first branch. However, where a constant combined airflow of the first and the second branches is to be maintained, the control system can reduce the airflow through the first branch relative to the second branch by reducing the mass airflow through the first branch by an amount that is equal to an increase in the mass airflow through the second branch.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, the control system can control the mass airflow through one or both of the branches to respond to imbalances in the mass airflow between the two branches by adjusting one or more actuators described herein. For example, the control system can vary an operating parameter of the turbine (e.g. turbine geometry, wastegate position, etc.) to increase or decrease the speed of the compressor, thereby varying the mass airflow through the compressor's branch. For example, the mass airflow through the first branch can be increased by increasing the speed of the compressor arranged along the first branch and can be reduced by reducing the speed of the compressor. Similarly, the mass airflow through the second branch can be increased by increasing the speed of the compressor arranged along the second branch and can be reduced by reducing the speed of the compressor. Various approaches for reducing (MAF_Imbalance) will be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow chart depicting an example approach for controlling the engine system to reduce the mass airflow difference between different branches of the engine's air intake system. At <b>310</b>, the initial (e.g. current) actuator settings can be identified. For example, the control system may assess the current operating state of the various actuators associated with the turbocharger wastegates, variable geometry turbines, intake and exhaust valve timing devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control system may then perform one or more of the operations described with reference to <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b> to reduce the imbalance between the different branches of the engine's air intake system. As one or more of the actuators are adjusted as directed by one or more of the operations of <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b>, the control system may monitor the actuator settings with regards to their control limits. If one of the actuators has reached its control limit (e.g. a wastegate is fully closed or fully open) then the control system may adjust one or more other actuators that have not yet reached their control limits in order to further reduce mass airflow imbalances between the different air intake branches of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At <b>320</b>, at least one wastegate may be adjusted to reduce the mass airflow of the intake branch having the greater mass airflow and/or to increase the mass airflow of the intake branch having the lower mass airflow. For example, the control system may open or increase the opening of the wastegate associated with the turbocharger that is responsible for the higher mass airflow to reduce the level of compression provided by the compressor, thereby reducing the mass airflow associated with that branch. Alternatively or additionally, the control system may close or reduce the opening of the wastegate associated with the turbocharger that is responsible for the lower mass airflow to increase the level of compression provided by the compressor, thereby increasing the mass airflow associated with that branch. Note that if one of the wastegates has reached its control limit and additional adjustment of the mass airflow is desired, the control system can further adjust the other wastegate among other actuators described with reference to operations <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b> if they have not yet reached their control limit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>330</b>, the geometry of at least one of the exhaust turbines may be adjusted to reduce the mass airflow of the air intake branch having the greater mass airflow and/or to increase the mass airflow of the air intake branch having the lower mass airflow. For example, the control system may adjust the turbine's impeller geometry to increase the conversion of the energy contained in the exhaust gases to kinetic energy, which may be supplied to the compressor associated with the lower mass airflow branch, thereby increasing the mass airflow provided to the engine by that branch via higher compression. Alternatively or additionally, the control system may adjust the turbine's impeller geometry to reduce the conversion of the energy contained in the exhaust gases to kinetic energy, which may be supplied to the compressor associated with the higher mass airflow branch, thereby reducing the mass airflow associated with that branch via lower compression. Note that if one of the variable geometry turbine actuators has reached its control limit and additional adjustment of the mass airflow is desired, the control system can further adjust the other variable geometry turbine among other actuators described with reference to operations <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b> if they have not yet reached their control limit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At <b>340</b>, one or more operating parameters of at least one cylinder group (e.g. including one or more cylinders of the engine) may be adjusted to reduce the mass airflow of the air intake branch having the greater mass airflow and/or to increase the mass airflow of the air intake branch having the lower mass airflow. For example, the control system may vary the valve timing, spark timing, fuel amount, or fuel injection timing associated with a group of cylinders to increase or decrease the amount of exhaust gas energy that is provided to their respective exhaust gas turbines. For example, the control system can increase the exhaust gas energy provided to a turbine associated with a lower mass airflow branch in order to increase the compression provided by the compressor, which in turn can increase the mass airflow provided by the particular branch of the air intake system. Alternatively or additionally, the control system can reduce the exhaust gas energy provided to a turbine associated with the greater mass airflow branch in order to reduce the compression provided by the compressor, which in turn can reduce the mass airflow provided by the particular branch of the air intake system. Note that if one of actuators including the intake and exhaust valve actuators, sparking device, or fuel injector has reached its control limit and additional adjustment of the mass airflow is desired, the control system can further adjust the operating parameters associated with other cylinders among other actuators described with reference to operations <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b> if they have not yet reached their control limit.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At <b>350</b>, it may be judged whether the actuators that are operable to reduce the mass airflow imbalance have attained their respective control limits. If the answer is no, the routine may return to provide additional reduction of mass airflow imbalance via one or more of <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, or <b>340</b> as directed by the control system. Alternatively, if the answer at <b>350</b> is yes, the control system may indicate that the turbocharger associated with the lower mass airflow branch has failed or has degraded. For example, the control system can provide an indication of turbocharger or wastegate degradation or failure to the vehicle operator or repair personnel and/or may disable operation of the engine if appropriate in order to reduce damage that may otherwise occur.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a control diagram schematically depicting the control strategy of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, outputs from a combination of sensors such as the mass airflow sensor, engine speed sensor, intake manifold pressure sensor, intake manifold temperature sensor, throttle position sensor, etc. may be used by the control system to identify the total mass airflow to the engine (MAF_Total) and the mass airflow of a single branch of the engine's intake air system (MAF_<b>1</b>) as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The difference between MAF_Total and MAF_<b>1</b> can be determined in order to estimate the mass airflow (MAF_<b>2</b>) through the second branch of the engine's air intake system without necessarily requiring a mass airflow signal to be provided from a mass airflow sensor disposed within the second branch.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The difference between MAF_<b>1</b> and MAF_<b>2</b> may be used to determine the extent of the mass airflow difference (MAF_Imbalance) between the different branches of the engine's air intake system. A threshold mass airflow difference (MAF_Threshold) may be selected based on operating conditions, may be based on a fixed value, or may be based on a ratio of MAF_<b>1</b> and MAF_<b>2</b>. The difference between MAF_Imbalance and MAF_Threshold may be identified as the error to which the control system responds by adjusting one or more actuators of the engine system as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The resulting mass airflow from the adjustments to the actuators can be identified by one or more of the above described sensors as the process may be repeated. In this way, imbalances between the airflow provided to the engine via two separate branches each including a turbocharger may be identified and a suitable control strategy may be implemented to reduce the imbalance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, one or more of the various approaches described herein may be used to reduce mass airflow imbalance between different branches of the engine's intake system during conditions where only one of the branches includes a mass airflow sensor or where a mass airflow sensor associated with one of the branches has failed or becomes degraded. In this way, by reducing the mass airflow imbalance responsive to a detected change in one of the combined mass airflow (MAF_Total) and the mass airflow through the first branch (MAF_<b>1</b>), noise and vibration harshness (NVH) of the engine may be reduced and/or fuel efficiency may be increased.</p>
