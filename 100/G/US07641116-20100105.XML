<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to vote by mail envelopes and deals more particularly with an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of subsystems to distribute ballots that individual voters use to record voted selections are utilized in governmental elections in the United States. One such subsystem uses paper ballots that are mailed to the voter who marks the ballot and returns the ballot through the mail. Mailed ballots have been historically reserved for absentee voting. In the usual absentee voting process, the voter marks the ballot to cast his/her vote and then inserts the ballot in a return envelope which is typically pre-addressed to the voter registrar office in the corresponding county, town or locality in which the voter is registered. The voter typically appends his/her signature on the back of the envelope adjacent his/her identification. When the return envelope is received at the registrar's office, a voting official compares the voter signature with the voter signature retrieved from the registration file to make a determination as to whether or not the vote can be considered as authentic.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One general problem with vote by mail envelopes is the signature is in the open and exposed for all to see throughout the process for determining whether or not the vote is authentic during the comparison of the signature recorded on the envelope to the signature retrieved from the registration file which gives rise to privacy issues and concerns. Also, in the prior art system, signatures are exposed to numerous delivery workers throughout the mail delivery process. Further, there is little control over who records the vote thus adding to the issue of privacy concerns. In addition, voting by mail is becoming more prevalent apart from the usual absentee voting and in some western states, entire elections are being conducted exclusively by mail which also give rise to these privacy concerns because of the exposure of the voter's signature on the registrar return envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One possible solution to ensure the privacy of the voter is to have the signature placed below the flap of the envelope so that it is hidden when the envelope is sealed. The flap would have a pre-cut perforated area substantially in registration where it covers the signature. At the registrar's office, a voting official tears off the pre-cut perforated area to open a window thereby revealing the signature to allow the signature to be compared to the signature retrieved from the registration file. The ballot itself however, would remain sealed inside the envelope so that the voting official who authenticates the signature cannot see the ballot. Once the signature has been authenticated, the envelope is opened and the ballot removed and passed onto another voting official to count the votes. The proposed solution is rather cumbersome to do by hand and is virtually impossible to automate and integrate with an automated processing of vote by mail ballots such as for example, a system known as &#x201c;Relia-Vote&#x201d; and available from the assignee from the present invention. A further drawback and disadvantage of the proposed solution is once the signature has been revealed, it remains visible to the voting officials who remove the ballots from the envelope to count the votes and to any person authorized or not who happens to be in the vicinity of the signed envelope. Accordingly, the issue of voter privacy is still a concern with the proposed solution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot wherein the privacy of the voter is maintained during the ballot examination and vote counting process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with a broad aspect of the invention, an envelope of use in containing and authenticating a ballot is presented. The envelope has a containment region dimensioned to receive a ballot or other desired document in accordance with the particular application with which the envelope is used and has a pre-defined area on the back to carry the signature of a person such as a voter using the envelope to vote by mail. A flap portion outside the pre-defined area is used to seal the containment region. A window cover is substantially in registration with the pre-defined signature area to obscure the signature in a first operative configuration and to reveal the pre-defined signature area in a second operative configuration (for electronic capture, for example) and to re-obscure the signature area after the signature area has been revealed whereby the ballot remains sealed during the pre-defined signature area obscured, revealed and re-obscured configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Seal strips on the flap portion facing the backside of the envelope when the envelope is closed are located outside the pre-defined signature area and a pre-cut section of the flap portion between the seal strips forms the window cover. In one aspect, a slit located at one end of the pre-cut section receives mechanical opening fingers to automatically remove the window cover when the envelope moves through an automatic opening machine. The pre-defined signature area is re-obscured by an opaque covering that is applied in place of the window covering.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the window cover is formed by a pre-cut section between the seal strips and extends the full width of the flap portion and the opening fingers are received between the flap portion and the backside of the envelope to automatically remove the window cover when the envelope moves through an automatic opening machine. The pre-defined signature area is re-obscured by an opaque covering that is applied in place of the window covering.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further aspect, the flap portion has a length dimension greater than the length dimension of the backside of the envelope and a bottom fold over portion which is folded and adhered to the bottom of the address side of the envelope forming a folded flap at the bottom of the envelope to obscure the pre-defined signature area. The folded flap is slit along the bottom to separate the bottom fold over portion from the remaining portion of the flap portion and the window cover formed between the seal strip above the pre-defined signature area and the bottom of the flap portion is lifted away from the backside of the envelope to reveal the pre-defined signature area. The pre-defined signature area is re-obscured by adhering the window cover to the backside of the envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a still further aspect, the window cover is formed by a transparent material carried on the backside of the envelope and has a sticky surface side and an opposite opaque layer side. The window cover is folded to cover the pre-defined signature area with the sticky side facing the backside of the envelope and the opaque layer side facing outwardly. The pre-defined signature area is revealed by removing the opaque layer to view the pre-defined signature area through the transparent material forming the window cover. The pre-defined signature area is re-obscured by re-applying an opaque layer to the window cover. The opaque layer may be removed with mechanical or chemical means depending on the material used to form the opaque layer.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to the drawings and considering the invention in further detail with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot is illustrated therein and generally designated <b>10</b>. The envelope <b>10</b> includes a containment region dimensioned for receipt of a ballot or other desired document in accordance with the particular application with which the envelope is used. The back side <b>12</b> of the envelope <b>10</b> includes a pre-defined area generally designated <b>14</b> which area typically holds the signature of the voter corresponding to the ballot contained by the envelope. The envelope includes a flap portion generally designated <b>16</b> and folding over the back <b>12</b> of the envelope for sealing the containment region. The flap portion <b>16</b> also contains a pre-cut window generally designated <b>18</b> substantially in registration with the pre-defined signature area <b>14</b>. The flap portion <b>16</b> includes an upper edge flap seal strip on the flap side toward the back side <b>12</b> of the envelope <b>10</b> to seal the containment region when the flap <b>16</b> is folded and pressed toward the back side <b>12</b> of the envelope. The flap portion <b>16</b> includes a lower edge flap seal strip <b>22</b> on the side of the flap portion <b>16</b> facing the back side <b>12</b> of the envelope <b>10</b> to seal the flap portion <b>16</b> along the second sealing strip <b>22</b> at the bottom of the back side <b>12</b> of the envelope <b>10</b> thereby covering the signature area <b>14</b>. The sealing strips <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are located in a region above and below the pre-cut window <b>18</b> and extend in a width-wise direction of the envelope and may be of any suitable sealing means to carry out the intended function. For example, the strips may be an adhesive protected by a releasable covering that is removed when the envelope is closed. The window cover <b>18</b> is defined by a pre-cut section of the area of the flap portion <b>16</b> between the upper and lower edge flap seal strips <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> respectively. The window cover <b>18</b> also includes an open slit <b>24</b> in one end <b>26</b> of the window cover <b>18</b> and is dimensioned to receive mechanical opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. Window cover <b>18</b> preferably includes pre-made horizontal perforations along its upper and lower borders. These perforations allow easier opening of the window cover. When the envelope <b>10</b> moves through an automated window cover opening machine as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> lift the window cover in a direction <b>32</b> away from the flap portion <b>16</b> and the envelope <b>10</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to remove the window cover to reveal the pre-defined signature area <b>14</b>. The signature area <b>14</b> is re-obscured by applying an opaque covering <b>34</b> in place of the window cover <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The window cover <b>18</b> is removed by the automated window cover opening machine as the envelope moves in the direction indicated by the direction arrow <b>36</b> by means of a roller nip <b>38</b> moving the envelope leading edge <b>40</b> past the opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> such that the tip end <b>42</b> enters the open slit <b>24</b> of the window cover. The envelope is slightly bent as it passes through the nib <b>38</b> to optimize the slit opening to facilitate entry of the tip end <b>42</b> of the opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> into the slit opening. The slit opening may be further optimized by blowing air into the slit opening from the end <b>44</b> of an air tube <b>46</b> suitably arranged in the region of the mechanical opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. It will be appreciated that the cover <b>18</b> can also be removed manually. The signature area <b>14</b> that is revealed when the window cover <b>18</b> is removed may be re-obscured by applying an opaque sticker <b>34</b> to replace the window cover <b>18</b> to re-conceal the signature area. Alternately, the inside face of window cover <b>18</b> could be coated with a sticky adhesive (such as that used on &#x201c;Post-IT Notes&#x201d; by 3M) such that the window cover could be re-applied to the window after it has been removed to reveal the signature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot is illustrated therein in a second embodiment and generally designated <b>60</b>. The envelope includes a containment region is dimensioned for receipt of a ballot and includes a pre-defined signature area on the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope <b>60</b>. A flap portion <b>62</b> seals the containment region and covers the pre-defined signature area <b>76</b> by means of a window cover <b>66</b> substantially in registration of the signature area <b>76</b> to obscure the signature area when the flap portion <b>62</b> is folded toward the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope <b>60</b>. The window cover <b>66</b> is defined by the area of the flap portion between an upper edge flap seal strip <b>72</b> and a lower edge flap seal strip <b>74</b> by means of a width-wise perforation inward of each of the flap seal strips <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and extending between the side edges of the flap portion <b>62</b>. The signature area <b>76</b> is revealed by tearing the window cover <b>66</b> along the perforations <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> in the direction away from the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope as indicated by the direction arrow <b>78</b>. In this embodiment, the mechanical opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> engage directly below the window cover <b>66</b> through the edge of the flap to pass between the window cover <b>66</b> and the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope <b>60</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the tip end <b>44</b> of the mechanical opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> enters beneath the window cover <b>66</b> as the envelope <b>60</b> is moved by the nib <b>38</b> in the moving direction <b>36</b> of the envelope <b>60</b> to remove the window cover <b>66</b>. The envelope is slightly bent by the action of the rollers forming the nib <b>38</b> to optimize the opening between the window cover <b>66</b> and the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope. The opening between the window cover <b>66</b> and the back side <b>64</b> of the envelope may be further optimized by blowing air through an air tube <b>46</b> appropriately arranged with the opening fingers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> as described above. It will be appreciated that cover <b>66</b> may also be removed manually. The signature area <b>76</b> that is revealed when the window cover <b>66</b> is removed may be re-obscured by applying an opaque sticker <b>80</b> to replace the window cover <b>66</b> to re-conceal the signature area.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-23</figref>, an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot is illustrated therein in a third embodiment and generally designated <b>90</b>. The envelope <b>90</b> includes a containment region dimensioned for receipt of a ballot and the backside <b>94</b> includes a pre-defined area <b>108</b> for containing a signature of the person returning the ballot. The flap portion <b>92</b> includes an upper edge flap seal strip <b>96</b> arranged to face the back side <b>94</b> of the envelope when the flap <b>92</b> is folded toward the back side of the envelope to seal the ballot within containment region of the envelope. The flap portion <b>92</b> also includes a bottom fold over portion <b>100</b> which is folded along the fold line <b>104</b> to face the front face <b>114</b> of the envelope <b>90</b>. A lower seal strip <b>98</b> is carried on the side of the bottom fold over portion <b>100</b> facing the front face <b>114</b> of the envelope <b>90</b> to hold the flap in a closed position. A window cover <b>110</b> is defined in the region of the flap portion <b>92</b> between the fold lines <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to cover the pre-defined signature area <b>108</b> when the flap is in the closed position. A narrow band of folded flap <b>106</b> is created when the bottom fold over portion <b>100</b> of the flap is folded in the direction <b>116</b> toward the front face <b>114</b> of the envelope. When the envelope is received at the registrars office, the narrow band folded flap <b>106</b> is cut along the bottom slit line <b>118</b> to separate the bottom fold over portion <b>100</b> adhered to the front surface <b>114</b> of the envelope from the remaining portion of the flap portion <b>92</b>. The window cover <b>110</b> of the flap portion <b>92</b> is lifted in the direction indicated by the arrow <b>112</b> away from the back side <b>94</b> of the envelope to reveal the signature area <b>108</b>. The window cover <b>110</b> is then folded back toward the back side <b>94</b> of the envelope in the direction <b>120</b> to re-conceal the signature area <b>108</b>. The window cover <b>110</b> may be glued or otherwise adhered to the back side <b>94</b> of the envelope the side of the window cover facing the back side <b>94</b> of the envelope may carry a suitable adhesive means or an adhesive may be applied utilizing any suitable means to carry out the function to reseal the window cover to the backside of the envelope to re-conceal the signature area.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>, an envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot is illustrated therein and generally designated <b>130</b>. The envelope <b>130</b> includes a containment region for receipt of a ballot. A pre-defined area <b>136</b> for carrying a signature of the person casting the ballot is located on the back side <b>134</b> of the envelope <b>130</b>. A flap portion <b>132</b> located outside the pre-defined area is used to seal the containment region of the envelope. A window cover <b>138</b> is also carried on the back side <b>134</b> of the envelope <b>130</b> and is folded in the direction indicated by the direction arrow <b>140</b> along the fold line <b>142</b> toward the signature area <b>136</b> to conceal the pre-defined signature area. The surface <b>146</b> of the window cover <b>138</b> facing the signature area <b>136</b> when the window cover is folded over the signature area is a sticky surface and carries a suitable adhesive so that the window cover is glued or otherwise adhered over the signature area when in contact with the area. The window cover <b>138</b> is made of a suitable transparent material and carries an opaque layer <b>144</b> on its outwardly facing surface <b>148</b> when the window cover <b>138</b> is folded over the signature area <b>136</b> to conceal the signature area. When the envelope is received at the registrars office, the signature area <b>136</b> is revealed by removing the opaque layer <b>144</b> by using one or more scratch rolls <b>150</b> to reveal the signature area <b>136</b> through the transparent window cover <b>138</b>. A new opaque layer may be applied on top of the transparent window cover after the signature is revealed to re-conceal the signature. The opaque layer may be of any suitable material to carry out the intended function for example the materials used on &#x201c;scratch off&#x201d; cards which are well known in the art and to the general public. Alternately, the opaque layer may be removable through a chemical rather than mechanical process. In a further embodiment, the other physical properties may be applied to remove the opaque layer, or to make the opaque layer transparent. Such physical properties may include heat, pressure, radiation, or magnetism.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An envelope for use in containing and authenticating a ballot has been presented above in several exemplary embodiments. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention for example, individual flap seal strips are disclosed to seal the flap portion on either side of the signature area wherein the window cover is defined between the sealed strips. In order to avoid that the voter may forget to seal the flap along the upper seal strip, the seal strips may have one protective releasable covering that when removed exposes the adhesive side of both the upper and lower edge flap seal strips such that the seal strips adhere to the envelope when the flap is folded closed. Accordingly, the invention has been presented by way of illustration rather than limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, while the preferred embodiments have been described in connection with governmental voting, it will be understood that the invention may be used in the private sector, for example, corporate shareholder voting.</p>
