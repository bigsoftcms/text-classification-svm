<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a leak detecting device comprising a sniffing probe and a test gas sensor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Leak detecting devices serve for detecting leaks in test objects containing a test gas, such as helium. Leak detecting devices are known which comprise a hand-held sniffing tip. Gas is taken in through the sniffing probe and fed to a test gas sensor. The devices require a vacuum pump which is normally accommodated in a floor- or table-mounted device, i.e. a basic device placed on the floor or on a table. The basic device frequently also includes the test gas detector. Said test gas detector may be a mass spectrometer or a structurally smaller infrared gas analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Normally, the sniffing probe is connected with the basic device via a capillary line. The operator can relatively easily move the sniffing probe in the vicinity of the test object in search of possible leaks. However, such leak detecting devices have a longer response time. The response time is the period between the intake of the leakage gas and the indication. The response time is determined by the length of the sniffing line which is typically 5 meters. Added to this is the response time of the test gas detector.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 03/008923 A2 describes a sniffing-type leak detector where the test gas detector is integrated in a handpiece to which the sniffing probe is attached. The handpiece may be connected with the floor- or table-mounted basic device via a line, wherein the basic device comprises, inter alia, a vacuum pump and an indicator means. Said leak detecting device has a short response time due to the short distance between the intake opening of the sniffing probe on the one hand and the test gas detector on the other hand. However, the handpiece with the sensors arranged therein is large and heavy such that the use of the leak detecting device in continuous operation is fatiguing to the operator. Further, constricted regions of the test objects are difficult to access by the voluminous handpiece.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide a leak detecting device comprising a hand-held sniffing probe, which leak detecting device, on the one hand, has a relatively short response time and, on the other hand, is adapted to be operated without causing fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The leak detecting device according to the invention comprises a test gas detector fixed to a holder which is adapted to be carried on the body of an operator, and the sniffing probe which is movably connected with the sniffing tip via a flexible capillary line. The sniffing tip may be of very small and light-weight configuration such that it can be easily held by the operator and guided to the desired places. Moving the sniffing tip does not cause fatigue even if the device is operated over longer period. From the sniffing tip the relatively short capillary line having a length of approximately 1 meter extends to a carrying device fastened to the body of the operator. The holder required for this purpose is a belt, for example, to which the carrying device can be attached without impeding the free movement of the operator. Although the required capillary line slightly increases the response time, its length is so small that this is negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The vacuum pump required for taking in the gas may be accommodated in a basic device configured as a floor- or table-mounted device. The basic device is connected with the carrying device via a flexible line which comprises both a capillary line and electrical lines. The length of said line does not increase the response time. Alternatively, it is possible to integrate a vacuum pump into the carrying device. This however increases the volume and the weight of the carrying device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sniffing probe may be a pin with a maximum length of 15 cm and a maximum diameter of 15 mm. The pin may be provided with a projecting handle and thus be configured as a gun. A switch for manually starting the testing operation may also be provided at the sniffing probe.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular an infrared gas analyzer is a suitable test gas sensor designed for being carried in the carrying device fastened to the body.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an operator carries a carrying device <b>11</b> in a holder <b>10</b>. The holder <b>10</b> is a simple belt in which the carrying device <b>11</b> is suspended. From the carrying device <b>11</b>, a capillary line <b>12</b> extends to a sniffing probe <b>13</b>. The sniffing probe <b>13</b> is configured as an elongate pin having the dimensions of a ball pen, for example. At its tip, a suction inlet <b>14</b> is provided through which gas is taken in. The capillary line <b>12</b> is of flexible configuration such that the sniffing probe <b>13</b> can be unimpededly moved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">From the carrying device <b>11</b>, a flexible line <b>15</b> extends to a basic device <b>16</b> configured as a floor- or table-mounted device, which comprises a vacuum pump, as well as control units and an indicator means, as well as alarm means, if necessary. The flexible line <b>15</b> includes, inter alia, a capillary line, power supply lines and signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the sniffing probe <b>13</b> which is connected with the carrying device <b>11</b> via a flexible capillary line <b>12</b>. The flexible line <b>15</b> connecting the carrying device <b>11</b> with the basic device <b>16</b> includes a capillary line <b>20</b>, as well as electrical lines <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The carrying device <b>11</b> includes the test gas detector <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The test gas detector is an infrared gas analyzer comprising a cuvette <b>23</b> through which the gas taken in flows in longitudinal direction. The gas inlet of the cuvette is connected with the capillary line <b>12</b>, and the gas outlet is connected with the capillary line <b>20</b>. At the front end of the cuvette <b>23</b> an infrared light source <b>24</b> is located, and at the other end an infrared detector <b>25</b> is arranged. The signals of the infrared detector <b>25</b> are evaluated by a microprocessor <b>26</b> and transmitted to the basic device <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Generally, the sniffing probe <b>13</b> draws ambient air into the carrying device <b>11</b>. If the test object containing a test gas has a leak, the test gas escapes into the ambient air. The test gas detector <b>22</b> selectively responds to the presence of test gas such that the presence of a leak is detected.</p>
