<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to data systems, and more particularly to data collection and processing systems using portable, hand-held data terminals for collecting, selectively processing and for communicating collected data to other system elements. Typical collection processes may include reading data and manually keying in such read data. Typical automated processes may include scanning indicia of information with a scanner, for example a bar code reader. Data collected by such terminals may become part of the data base of the system. Real time use of data collected by the data terminals may be implemented by communication interfaces within such data terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Though host computers which as central processing stations of such data systems may control data bases and data flow, the hand-held data terminals are key elements for operating the data systems efficiently. Current data systems using hand-held data terminals have shown a correlation between the functionality of the hand-held data terminals and the overall effectiveness of the systems. While progress has already been made in improving efficiency and functionality of hand-held data terminals, there is nevertheless a need to provide hand-held data terminals which are readily adaptable to perform various functions and communicate with a variety of communications equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The PCT application Ser. No. 90/0382, filed Jun. 7. 1989, assigned to and owned by the assignee of the present application, the descriptive matter of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, refers to a modular hand-held unit and discloses a manner of attaching one functional module to another.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this invention, one of a plurality of special purpose data and communications modules is selectively combined with a base module or unit of the hand-held data terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one particular aspect of the invention, a base unit includes a user interface in an upward directed surface which would typically be facing toward a person using the data terminal. The user interface typically features a keyboard adjacent a bottom end, and a liquid crystal display adjacent a top end of a substantially rectangular, elongate housing of the data terminal. The base unit provides for a data and communications module to be attached beneath the user interface and adjacent the top end of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another particular aspect of the invention, the data and communications module attachable to the base module includes a communications means of one type, such as a radio using spread spectrum modulation transmissions, the data and communications module including provisions emulating data communications of a second type, the second type of communications and the respective protocol being compatible with data circuits of the base module.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another particular aspect of the invention, the data and communications module to be attached to the base module includes provisions for data communications and a data scanner provision for collecting data. In a more particular implementation of the invention, the base module includes data collection provisions, collected data being transferable via a cable mounted to the base unit. In combination with the data scanner module, the data and communications module includes provisions for selectively switching data collection operations between the data scanner provision of the data and communications module and the data collection provisions of the base module.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the invention the data and communications module may include a modem and typical telephone communications coupling either in lieu of a radio communications provision or in addition thereto. The modem may be provided in the data and communications module with a data scanning device or with alternate data identification and collection provisions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one particular implementation including certain features of the invention, the data and communications module is contemplated to include the combination of a radio frequency communications provision and a data identification and collection provision, and an antenna of radio frequency communications provision of the data and communications module may be pivotally mounted to be pivoted to a position out of interfering relationship with the data identification and collection provision, while optimally receiving radio frequency communication.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In furtherance of efficient adaptability of data communications modules to base modules of the data terminals in accordance with the invention, it is contemplated to provide an elastic hand strap on the downward facing surface of a data terminal for retaining manual engagement with the data terminal, the hand strap being attached at one end thereof to a base module of the data terminal. A second, opposite end of the elastic strap is slidably inserted into engagement with a guide track disposed in an outer surface of the data and communications module. The direction of insertion is in the direction of the one end of the elastic hand strap, such that an elastic tension in the hand strap retains the slidable engagement of the other elastic hand strap with the data and communications module of the data terminal. In accordance with the invention, the elastic strap is readily removed without tools by sliding the second end along the guide track in a direction against the tension of the elastic strap.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment according to the invention, in which a base unit includes a data and control interface for interacting with a data and communications module, an improvement in each of a plurality of data and communications modules includes a data and control interface provision including data and control signal conversion provisions for communicating data between the data and communication module and the base module in accordance with a data protocol resident within the base unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various other features and advantages of the data terminal in accordance with the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which may be best understood when read with reference to the appended drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a data collection terminal unit, also referred to herein as data terminal, is designated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a frontal face <b>12</b> of an elongate housing <b>14</b> of a base module <b>16</b> of the data terminal <b>10</b> typical faces upward and is accessible to the user of the data terminal. The upward facing portion of the module <b>16</b> houses a keyboard module <b>17</b>, including an alphanumerical keyboard <b>18</b> and a display screen <b>19</b>. The display screen <b>19</b> is in a preferred embodiment described herein a 4-line by 16-character Reflective Super Twist Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Of course, other display means may be used in its stead. The keyboard <b>18</b> includes a lower, standard numerical keyboard section <b>21</b>, above which is disposed an alphabetical keyboard arrangement <b>22</b>. An On-off power key <b>23</b> is preferably placed in a leftmost position of an uppermost row on an uppermost row of five keys. The outermost keys <b>24</b> in a bottom row are configured as &#x201c;CLEAR&#x201d; and &#x201c;ENTER&#x201d;, while the remaining four keys in the uppermost row are preferably configured as a set of tour user-defined function keys <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At a bottom end <b>30</b> of the housing <b>14</b>, there are located two connector plugs <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> in recesses <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, respectively. Inasmuch as the connectors <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are disposed in the recesses, adjacent end and interleaved protrusions <b>36</b> of the housing <b>14</b> extend somewhat past the connectors to protect the connectors from damage should the data terminal accidentally be dropped or set down on the bottom end <b>30</b>. A preferred embodiment of the data terminal <b>10</b> is intended to withstand without damage a drop of about 1.2 meters to a solid surface, such as concrete. The preferred connector <b>31</b> is an input-output port, as may be used for such data collection as bar code reading, for example. In such instance, the connector <b>31</b> is preferred to be a 9-pin D-subminiature connector with pins interfacing to typical 5 volt scanning peripherals. The connector <b>32</b> may be used for accessing external power sources or provide of combined power and data communication. A circular miniature DIN-type connector <b>32</b> may be used in the preferred embodiment. A top end <b>40</b> of the preferred embodiment of the base module <b>16</b> typically may not include connectors. An antenna <b>41</b> shown to extend above the top end <b>40</b> is further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of a data terminal <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The base module <b>16</b> of the data terminal <b>10</b> includes an elongate upper housing portion <b>43</b> and a battery compartment <b>44</b> attached to the upper housing portion <b>43</b> adjacent the bottom end <b>30</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the battery compartment <b>44</b> is assembled as a lower housing portion to the upper housing portion <b>43</b> and is equipped with a battery compartment door <b>46</b> which may be locked to seal an opening of the battery compartment <b>44</b>. Adjacent the top end <b>40</b> of the data terminal <b>10</b> a data and communications module <b>48</b> is attached to the lower edge of the upper housing portion <b>43</b>. The antenna <b>41</b> extends upward from the data and communications module <b>48</b> above the top end <b>40</b> of the data terminal <b>10</b>. An elastic hand strap <b>49</b> is attached to the underside of the data terminal <b>10</b>. A belt clip <b>50</b> may conveniently be mounted to the hand strap <b>49</b>, allowing the data terminal to be carried on a user's belt. The elastic hand strap is attached adjacent the top end of the data terminal to the underside of the data and communications module <b>48</b> and adjacent the bottom end <b>30</b> to a sloped lower surface of the battery compartment <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One of the features of hand-held data terminals as disclosed herein and in the PCT application PCT/US90/03282 incorporated herein by reference relates to the exchangeability of modules of different shape and varied function. The data and communications module <b>48</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may for example include a radio module which is externally identified by the antenna <b>41</b>. The radio module may be a commercially available pretuned 1-watt (UHF) frequency modulated (FM) radio transceiver module, or any similar radio module, such as a Motorola P10&#x2122; radio model, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance herewith it is contemplated to provide the data and communications module <b>48</b> as a module which is readily replaceable with another data and communications module. Each such module will feature a quick exchange mounting mechanism, such as is more clearly illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and any of a number of features packaged in one of a number of compatible data and communications modules. When mounted, the module, such as the data and communications module <b>48</b> is matched in a contour continuation along a juncture <b>52</b> to the adjacent edge of the battery compartment <b>44</b> and along a longitudinal parting line <b>53</b> of the base module <b>16</b>. For example, the data and communications module <b>48</b> is sized to include the described radio frequency transceiver module, as indicated by the antenna <b>41</b>. Other data and communications modules may include a similar radio frequency transceiver module and may include additional memory capacity to function with the base module <b>16</b>. Various combinations of features are contemplated in accordance herewith.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the base module <b>16</b> and substantially in a ready position to become mounted to the base module <b>16</b> is a data and communications module designated generally by the numeral <b>55</b>. The data and communications module <b>55</b> is shown to represent generally a number of such data and communications modules which may be desirably incorporated into a communications system in accordance with the invention. It may be noted that the data and communications module <b>55</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as being of somewhat relatively greater depth or thickness than the data and communications module <b>48</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The change in outer dimensions illustrates that a number of modules of various depth are adapted to match with mounting provisions to attach the respective data and communications module <b>55</b> to the base module <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The data and communications module <b>5</b>, as a representative module featuring the attachment to the base module <b>16</b> has a plurality of laterally disposed latching hooks or latch hooks <b>56</b> which become engaged by respective latching seats or latch seats <b>57</b> disposed along the adjacent edge of the base module <b>16</b> when the module <b>55</b> is moved toward and into engagement with the adjacent edge and then toward the battery compartment <b>44</b>, as shown by the arrow. Electrical communication is established via a power and communications connector <b>61</b> the pins of which engage a mating connector socket <b>62</b> within the base module <b>16</b>. A set of screws <b>63</b> may be tightened through the battery compartment <b>44</b> into a set of threaded seats <b>64</b> disposed in the adjacent wall of the module <b>55</b> to securely retain the attached module as an integrated part of the data terminal <b>10</b>. At the top end of the data terminal <b>10</b>, a lip or extending stop edge <b>66</b> of the module <b>55</b> engages a complementarily shaped seat <b>67</b> at the top end of the base module <b>16</b> to securely interlock the data and communications module <b>55</b> with the base module <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is contemplated, for example, for the module <b>55</b> to include any of a number of combinations of diverse functional elements. For example, the module <b>55</b> may include the aforementioned transceiver, though the antenna <b>41</b> may be attached externally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or might be provided internally, in addition to extended data memory capacity, a modem or a reader of indicia of information may be included, such as a bar code reader, or a shelf tag reader. Shelf tag systems are known in which so-called &#x201c;shelf tags&#x201d; contain means for programming information into small display devices which are attached to front edges of merchandise storage shelves. The devices or tags would then retain the programmed data which may be acquired by the reader in the data and communication module <b>55</b>, for example. Information may be communicated between the shelf tag and the data terminal <b>10</b> by various means including radio frequency or optical transmission. Information may be communicated via optical readers in the data and communications terminal <b>16</b> as read from liquid crystals, or by other communication such as infra red optical, or low power RF data messages.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternate embodiment of the data terminal <b>10</b> in which the data terminal includes a data and communications module which includes, for example, a radio frequency transceiver module and a CCD scanner module which may be disposed in a lower portion of the module at <b>76</b>, having a scanning window at <b>77</b>. Since it may be desirable to position the scanning window near a surface at which data indicia such as bar code labels may be located, as indicated at <b>78</b>, the antenna which also protrudes from the top end of the data terminal <b>10</b> is found to be interfering when disposed in a normally protruding position. It is therefore contemplated to arrange the antenna <b>41</b> in a manner in which it may be pivoted from an upwardly protruding position, such as shown in phantom lines at <b>81</b> to a tilted position such as shown by the antenna <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, there is shown a pivotal joint which experiences little signal degradation when pivoted from such upwardly extended position to the tilted position in which the scanner window may be brought into proximity of a bar code label, for example, as described. The pivotal antenna joint includes a pivot base or pivot socket <b>83</b> into a hollow cup of which fits a pivot ball <b>84</b>. Both the pivot socket <b>83</b> and the pivot ball <b>84</b> are of REF dielectric to prevent radio frequency burns of a person touching the antenna when the associated radio transceiver is transmitting. The pivot socket <b>83</b> is mounted against an outer wall of the module, such as the module <b>48</b>, <b>55</b> or <b>75</b> by an antenna swivel post <b>35</b>. The swivel post <b>85</b> includes a spherical top against which rests a pivot washer <b>86</b>. The pivot washer is in turn urged into contact with the top of the swivel post by a cupped spring washer <b>87</b>, also at times referred to as Belville washer. The urging force against the spring washer <b>87</b> is provided by a doubly-threaded antenna mounting bushing <b>88</b>. An external thread of the bushing <b>88</b> screws into an upper opening of the pivot ball <b>84</b> to complete the pivot joint of the antenna. The antenna <b>41</b> screws with its base into the internal threads of the mounting bushing <b>88</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a lower dielectric skirt <b>89</b> of the antenna <b>41</b> extends downward over the outer edge of the bushing, which is of metal, to prevent exposure of the bushing. It should be understood that variations in the pivot joint may be possible within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another embodiment and further features of the invention as described herein. The elastic strap <b>49</b> may be permanently attached adjacent the bottom end of the data terminal <b>10</b> as described herein above. At an upper end, however, the elastic strap may be attached to the exchangeable data and communications modules, such as a module <b>90</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In that the modules are exchangeable and in an effort to facilitate a quick replacement of one module for another, the hand strap is attached to the module <b>90</b> by a guide structure <b>91</b> including left and right hand spaced guide tracks <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> which receive a guide bracket <b>94</b> attached to the upper end of the hand strap <b>49</b>. To attach the upper end of the hand strap <b>49</b> the elastic hand strap is stretched beyond its normal tensioned stretched length and the guide bracket <b>94</b> is inserted into an uppermost opening between the guide tracks <b>92</b> and <b>93</b>. The tension of the hand strap <b>49</b> pulls the bracket <b>94</b> into the space between the guide tracks <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>95</b>. The insertion of the bracket <b>94</b> securely captures the strap <b>49</b> at its upper end. To remove the hand strap at its upper point of attachment, the bracket is simply pulled out of the uppermost opening between the two spaced guide tracks <b>92</b> and <b>93</b>. The embodiment of the data and communications module <b>90</b> further shows typical telephone connector jacks <b>97</b> and <b>98</b> indicating that the module contains a typical modem unit for communication over standard telephone lines. The modem unit as shown by connectors <b>97</b>, <b>98</b> in the module <b>90</b> may be supplemented by memory for data storage prior to communication by the modem. In this manner the data terminal may be used in a batch process mode, data being transmitted at times and occasions convenient for telephone hook-up. Modem connections may also take on more significance in that the data terminal may be coupled to a typical cellular telephone unit which in turn can communicate via standard telephone communication networks over vast areas. In the latter mode batch transfer of data may still be desirable, though the need for substantial data storage capacity may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate a microprocessor controlled data transfer between the base module <b>16</b> and any of a number of data and communication modules which may include various data collection and data communication transceivers including complex radios such as a spread spectrum radio or such a modem for telephone transmission of data. Though not expressly described, it is understood that the hand-held data terminal <b>10</b> as described herein and all of its circuits, including those of attached modules are powered by a battery or power source which occupies the space of the battery compartment <b>44</b> as described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram of functions of the base module <b>16</b> and a typical data and communications module designated generally by the numeral <b>100</b>. The base module is operative in conjunction with a typical radio frequency transceiver provided by the data and communication module <b>100</b>, for example. The base module <b>16</b> includes a typical keyboard module <b>102</b> interactively coupled to a microprocessor <b>104</b>. A preferred microprocessor is a 80C196KC device which is a 16-bit microcontroller <b>105</b> with on-chip masked ROM, RAM and built-in timers, ports, analog to digital converters and a serial interface <b>106</b>. Thus, the microprocessor functions as a microcontroller and as an interface for communicating data and control signals to and from the base module <b>16</b>. In addition to the on-chip memory capacity, an external ROM <b>107</b> and an external RAM may be provided for additional data processing and communication capacity. Display controller and driver circuits <b>109</b> may be multi-chip circuits or may be integrated into a single device to drive the described LCD screen <b>110</b>. A typical scanner interface <b>115</b> is coupled to a 9-pin connector <b>116</b>, such as the referred to D subminiature connector which may couple a laser scanner or CCD scanner to the base module <b>16</b> for data collection.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The data and communication module <b>100</b> is of particular interest in that an improved interfacing may be obtained by coupling communication between the data and communication module <b>100</b> and the base module <b>16</b> through a microprocessor <b>125</b>, such as, for example an 80C51 microprocessor circuit. Typical on board ROM allows the microprocessor to be programmed to interact with a number of devices in accordance with the stored program. The microprocessor interacts with an interface circuit <b>126</b> which may be an analog or mixed analog and digital interface circuit. The program for interacting with the interface circuit <b>126</b> may also be stored within a ROM of the interface circuit <b>126</b>. The interface circuit <b>126</b> is coupled to a transceiver module <b>129</b>. The microprocessor <b>125</b> may also be coupled directly to a data collection interface <b>128</b> to receive data from a scanner for reading any number of different bar codes or for providing input data from other external sources. The operation of the microprocessor <b>125</b> for coupling data to the base module <b>16</b> allows various input patterns to be processed by any of specific operational protocols controlled by the microprocessor <b>125</b>, such that the data input from the data collection circuit can be made the same from any of a number of devices. Also with respect to the operation of the transceiver, in that the program for operating the microprocessor <b>125</b> may include particular address codes for data retrieval and data communication via the transceiver, the data sent via a data and control bus between the microprocessors <b>125</b> and <b>104</b> can emulate a uniform data transfer protocol to the base module <b>16</b>. The simplification resulting from the microprocessor <b>125</b> increases the number of communications devices that may be represented by the data communication transceiver circuit or module.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the base module <b>16</b> is shown as being coupled to a different data and communications module designated generally by the numeral <b>130</b> in which the interface circuit <b>126</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has been replaced with an interface circuit <b>132</b> and the transceiver coupled to the interface circuit <b>134</b>. The transceiver <b>134</b> may for example be a complex radio, such as a spread spectrum radio in lieu of an FM transceiver, such as may have been represented by the block identified at <b>129</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, the program function represented by the interface circuit <b>132</b> and interacting with the microprocessor permits the interactive control and data stream between the base module <b>16</b> and the data and communication module <b>130</b> to be emulated to appear to the base module <b>16</b> as being the same as the simple FM transceiver module. The reference to the particular microprocessor circuits should not be considered limiting to the scope of the invention. The combination of two microprocessors interacting with each other, each controlling the environment of a respective one of two submodules such as the base module and the data and communication module permits an increased number of different components and functions within the data system.</p>
