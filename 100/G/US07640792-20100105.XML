<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A storm water run-off percolation rate test system includes a turbid water generator having a silt or sediment source providing silt into a mixing tank. A pipeline carries turbid water from the mixing tank to a test pit or test site. A flow meter measures the amount of turbid water moved into the test pit. Detectors detect a water level in the test pit. A controller automatically controls the turbid water generator and flow of turbid water into the test pit, and records data on the amount of turbid water provided into the test pit over time, to determine a percolation rate. In a method for determining a percolation rate, turbid water is created and used in the percolation rate testing, to more accurately simulate run-off.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Construction of homes, buildings, roads and other development generally disrupts the hydrology, or the natural water cycle, of the local environment. The type, amount and locations of rain water runoff are changed. On undeveloped land, storm or rain water runoff tends to follow natural contours of the land, and can be absorbed by the soil. Grasses and vegetation on undeveloped land tend to slow movement of runoff, so that more of the runoff can evaporate or percolate into the ground. Construction of essentially water impermeable areas, such as buildings, roadways, sidewalks and parking lots, reduces natural ground absorption of water and increases runoff.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the runoff flows over developed land, it can pick up pollutants such as fertilizers, motor oil, animal waste, etc. It also picks up soil particles or silt. Accordingly, allowing the runoff to flow into lakes, rivers or streams tends to degrade them with pollutants, and/or clog them with silt. Various federal and state laws consequently regulate runoff into streams and rivers. Diverting runoff into a manmade structure such as a sewer or drainage ditch can help to control movement of the runoff. However, the runoff ultimately still cannot be released into a natural body of water (including salt water bodies), without tending to degrade them.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To minimize runoff problems, in many areas of the country, drainage basins are constructed as part of the land development. Drainage basins are generally excavated areas having gradually sloping sides, although naturally occurring drainage basins may also be used. A filter strip or grass swale may be located uphill from the drainage basin, to help remove suspended particulate pollutants, before the runoff collects in the drainage basin. Construction of drainage basins is often legally required by local government agencies, as part of the development approval and permitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The drainage basin ideally is located and contoured so that it collects as much differential runoff as possible from the developed land area, while also collecting little or no natural runoff. The drainage basin is also made large enough to avoid overflowing with differential runoff even during prolonged or intense rain storms. The bottom and sides of the drainage basin are generally porous, so that collected differential runoff diffuses into the ground over time. The design parameters of any specific drainage basin can vary widely depending on ground contours, surface soil and sub-soil conditions, climate, and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For many years, drainage basin designs have been tested by drilling one or more bores in the soil at or near the proposed drainage basin site, to create a runoff percolation test pit or site. The absorption rate of water from the test pit into the ground is then measured and recorded over a specified period of time. Based on these measurements, engineers can determine whether a proposed basin design is acceptable, or otherwise determine alternative design parameters for a drainage basin.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately, these existing techniques have certain disadvantages. Since they are generally necessarily performed using city or tap water, rather than actual runoff, the test results may not accurately correlate to real world conditions. Existing testing techniques have also relied largely on manual observation and recording of water level data. As a result, the test data may be subject to variations. It is also then labor intensive, and hence costly to obtain.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, improved testing apparatus and methods are needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">New and highly improved apparatus and methods have now been invented, overcoming various of the problems associated with techniques used in the past. In a first aspect, a percolation test apparatus comprises a turbid water generator having a silt source and a water mixing tank. A pipeline carries turbid water from the mixing tank into a test pit. A flow measuring instrument measures the volume of water moving from the mixing tank into the test pit. One or more water level measuring instruments measure the water level in the test pit. A data recorder and/or controller are linked to the measuring instruments, and record data from the measuring instruments. The data may be used to determine percolation rates.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a new method, silt or fine solids and tap water are mixed in a mixing tank, to create turbid water. The turbid water flows into an in-ground test site, to maintain the turbid water level in the test site near a selected nominal level. The amount of turbid water flowing into the test site is measured. Measurements taken over a selected time interval may be used to determine a percolation rate of the test site.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other and further objects and advantages will appear below. The invention resides as well in sub-combinations of the elements and steps described.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning now in detail to the drawings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a test system <b>30</b> is set up to conduct percolation testing. The test system <b>30</b> includes a turbid water generator generally designated as <b>32</b>, a test pit <b>22</b>, and a data recorder/controller <b>34</b>. The test pit <b>22</b> is typically an excavated pit or opening in the ground constructed specifically for the test system <b>30</b>. The test pit <b>22</b> is typically cylindrical, having a diameter of 3-10 or 4-6 feet, and a depth typically of about 3-10 or 4-6 feet. A test pit <b>22</b> may have other forms as well, such as a trench or stand pipe. It is also possible, in some instances, that a natural ground feature, could be used as a test pit, without the need for excavation and/or drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the test pit <b>22</b> is vertically below the turbid water generator <b>32</b>. This allows turbid water <b>24</b> created in the turbid water generator <b>32</b> to move into the test pit <b>22</b>, without pumping. Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the turbid water generator <b>32</b> includes a silt source <b>36</b> and a mixing tank <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the silt source <b>36</b> holds a supply of silt <b>38</b>, and may periodically supply predetermined amounts of silt into the mixing tank <b>90</b>. The silt typically includes fine soil particles collected up from the ground surface in or around the development site. As used here, silt means any type of fine solid particles. The silt <b>38</b> is intended to be of the same type that is naturally entrained into storm water runoff at the development site. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of a silt source <b>36</b>. Of course, various other types and designs of silt sources maybe used, to add silt into water in the mixing tank <b>90</b>. In the specific design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the silt source <b>36</b> includes a vessel <b>44</b> supported on legs <b>42</b>. The vessel <b>44</b> may be funnel-shaped. A bottom plate <b>60</b> closes off the lower end of the vessel <b>44</b>. An inspection window <b>66</b> may be provided in the vessel <b>44</b>, to allow for visual inspection inside the vessel <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A silt agitator <b>46</b> may also be included. In the design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the silt agitator <b>46</b> includes a pin collar <b>52</b> mounted on a shaft <b>50</b>. Pins <b>54</b> extend radially outwardly from the pin collar <b>52</b>. The shaft <b>50</b> is supported via shaft bushings <b>56</b>, on opposite sides of the lower end of the vessel <b>44</b>. An agitator motor <b>48</b> turns the shaft <b>50</b>. A motor controller <b>64</b> controls the agitator motor <b>48</b>. Rotation of the shaft <b>50</b> causes the pins <b>54</b> to move through the silt <b>38</b>, agitating and stirring the silt. The pins <b>54</b> which are typically 2-6 inches long, may be replaced with veins, paddles, chains, etc. Rotational movement of the pins <b>54</b> helps to stir and knock down silt, especially if the silt is wet and/or tends to clump up or stick to itself, or to surfaces within the vessel <b>44</b>. The shaft <b>50</b> rotates at, for example, 5-50, or 10-30 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A vibrator <b>58</b> may be attached to the vessel <b>44</b> to vibrate the vessel, to better prevent silt from sticking to the vessel sidewalls. The vibrator <b>58</b> may be placed on the outside of the vessel <b>44</b>, above the shaft <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A silt conveyor or mover <b>68</b> is positioned underneath the vessel <b>44</b>. In the design shown, the silt conveyor <b>68</b> is attached to the bottom plate <b>60</b>. While various types of silt conveyors may be used, in the example shown, the silt conveyor <b>68</b> includes an auger screw <b>76</b> within an auger tube <b>74</b>. A silt trough or opening <b>62</b> through the bottom plate <b>60</b> allows silt <b>38</b> to move from the vessel <b>44</b> into the auger tube <b>74</b>. An auger motor <b>70</b> turns the auger screw <b>76</b>, moving silt within the auger tube <b>74</b> from the silt opening <b>62</b> to a silt discharge opening <b>80</b> positioned over the mixing tank <b>90</b>. The outer end of the auger screw <b>76</b> may be rotatably supported in a bearing on an endplate <b>78</b>, closing off the end of the auger tube <b>74</b>. The auger motor <b>70</b> is controlled by an auger motor controller <b>72</b>. The shaft <b>50</b> and the auger tube <b>74</b> may be substantially horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The agitator motor <b>48</b> may be driven through a delay switch or relay <b>144</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), so that it can continue to operate for a specified amount of time, after the auger motor <b>70</b> stops, to provide sufficient free-flowing silt at the silt trough <b>62</b>, for the next silt supplying event. The vibrator may also be connected to the delay switch <b>144</b>, so that the vibrator <b>58</b> continues to operate for a pre-set amount of time after the auger motor <b>70</b> is turned off. The agitator motor <b>48</b> and the vibrator <b>58</b> may be single speed motors. The auger motor <b>70</b> is advantageously a variable speed motor, adjusted to provide enough silt to maintain a specified turbidity level.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While generally not required, the amount of silt moving through the system <b>30</b> may also be measured, for example, via weight sensors on the vessel <b>44</b> or by volume measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the mixing tank <b>90</b> may also have various configurations. In the design shown, a mixing tank <b>90</b> has a circular or cylindrical sidewall <b>94</b> and a tapering or generally conical bottom <b>96</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a kicker fin <b>98</b> may be provided at the bottom, to help prevent silt from collecting on the bottom of the mixing tank, and to help evenly mix silt into the water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, mixers are provided within the tank <b>90</b>. The mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, include a propeller attached to a mix motor. The mixers may have varying power, rotation speed, and/or propeller pitch, to create different mixing actions within the tank <b>90</b>. The propellers may also be adjustable in height and direction. Each of the mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> may be optionally separately controlled, or they may be controlled in a group. The mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> may be high power, medium power, and low power mixers, respectively. Depending on the silt conditions, or other factors, one or more of the mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> may be omitted or not used. Other forms of mechanical mixers, such as paddles, vanes, wire forms, etc. may also be used. Hydraulic mixing via water jets, in addition to the inlet water supplies described below, may also be used, alone, or with mechanical mixers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring momentarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a main water line <b>140</b> supplies city or tap water to the mixing tank <b>90</b> through an automatically controlled valve <b>142</b>. In areas where city water is not available, a pre-filled water tank may be used, with gravity as the pressure source for supplying water into the mixing tank. The mixing tank water inlet pipe <b>140</b> may be connected to a bottom water supply pipe <b>110</b> positioned to inject city or tap water at the bottom of the mixing tank <b>90</b>, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A rotation water supply pipe <b>112</b> is also supplied with city water from the inlet pipe <b>140</b>. The rotation water supply pipe may be positioned to inject water into the mixing tank <b>90</b>, typically in a direction tangential to the tank sidewalls, to induce swirling flow within the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a strainer <b>92</b> may be provided near the top of the mixing tank <b>90</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the strainer <b>92</b>, if used, may have multiple small openings, to allow silt particles to pass from the silt discharge opening <b>80</b> into a mixing tank <b>90</b>, while straining out larger particles. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a central strainer opening <b>93</b> may be provided at the low point of the strainer <b>92</b>. The strainer opening <b>93</b> allows rocks or other larger objects contained with the silt <b>38</b> to move to the center area of the mixing tank <b>90</b>, where they will not interfere with the mixers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a strainer water supply <b>114</b> may be provided at the top of the strainer <b>92</b>, to spray water into the strainer <b>92</b>. The strainer water supply <b>114</b>, if used, may include a strainer ring pipe or manifold <b>118</b>, and multiple strainer spray nozzles <b>116</b> aimed to spray water into the strainer <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a float switch <b>120</b> is provided in the mixing tank <b>90</b>, to monitor the water level within a mixing tank, and also turn off water supply into a mixing tank <b>90</b>, to prevent overflow. Within the mixing tank, the float switch <b>120</b> may operate the valve <b>142</b> (or separate valves on the mixing tank water supply types <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and/or <b>114</b>), to keep the mixing tank filled to a desired level with water. The system may be set up via relays or via the programmable controller <b>34</b> so that when the float switch <b>120</b> closes, turning on water supply to the mixing tank, the motors in the silt source <b>36</b>, specifically the agitator motor <b>48</b>, the vibrator <b>58</b>, and the auger motor <b>70</b>, are also turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an outside front view of the mixing tank <b>90</b>. A control/wiring box <b>122</b> may be attached to the mixing tank <b>90</b>. The data recorder/controller <b>34</b> may be installed within the box <b>122</b>. Individual power switches <b>126</b> may be provided for each of the mixer motors. A main power switch <b>124</b> may also be provided, along with a manual on/off switch <b>128</b>. An outlet <b>136</b> may be provided at the lower end of the tank sidewall, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or through the bottom, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A clearing water line may connect to a flush port <b>138</b>, to help reduce silt build up at the outlet <b>136</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a plumbing T <b>130</b> connects the outlet <b>136</b> to a first pit line <b>132</b> and a second pit line <b>134</b>. This allows the mixing tank <b>90</b> to supply turbid water to two separate test pits <b>22</b>. Of course, additional test pits may also be supplied, by increasing the capacity of the mixing tank <b>90</b> and via use of a distribution manifold, or multiple T-fittings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a pit supply line, such as line <b>132</b> and a test pit <b>22</b>. A flow meter <b>160</b> measures flow through the line <b>132</b>. Various types of flow meters may be used, including magnetic meters and other types. A pit supply valve <b>162</b> controls flow of water from the pit supply line <b>132</b> out through a pit spout <b>164</b> and into the test pit <b>22</b>. The pit supply valve <b>162</b> may be automatically controlled, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a system <b>170</b> for measuring the water level in the test pit <b>22</b> is provided. In the design shown, the pit water level measuring system <b>170</b> includes multiple float sensors within a float box <b>172</b>. The float box <b>172</b> is attached to a sidewall of the pit via a bracket <b>174</b>, so that the float box <b>172</b> is fixed in position. The float box <b>172</b> may be a rectangular open end box with a screen on the bottom, to allow water to enter, while reducing or avoiding turbulence. Since the bottom of the float box is substantially open, the water level within the test box is the same as the water level in the test pit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Other types of liquid level sensors may be used, including optical, sonic, electrical, and other types. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, wiring from the float sensors in the float box <b>172</b> connect to the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, three float sensors <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> are shown in the float box <b>172</b>. The first float sensor <b>180</b> may provide a continuous level output signal to the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>, so that the level of water within the test pit <b>22</b> may be continuously monitored. The second float sensor <b>182</b> may act as a &#x201c;switch on&#x201d; indicator, such that when the float <b>185</b> on the second float sensor <b>182</b> sinks to a predetermined level, the float sensor <b>182</b> sends a signal that opens the test pit supply valve <b>162</b>, to increase the level of water in the test pit <b>22</b> back to a desired nominal level. The third float sensor <b>184</b> may be a &#x201c;switch off&#x201d; indicator, with the float sensor <b>184</b> providing a signal that cuts off power to the pit supply valve <b>162</b>, to stop filling the pit <b>22</b> with turbid water, when the float <b>185</b> on the third float sensor <b>184</b> rises to a predetermined level. The float sensors <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> may be linked or wired to a relay <b>146</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, or to the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the float sensors <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> may be mounted on a top bracket <b>178</b> attached to the float box <b>172</b>. A visual depth scale <b>176</b> may be marked on the outside of the float box <b>172</b>, to allow for visual (manual) measurement of the water level in the test pit <b>22</b>. The float box <b>172</b> may also include a float driven kill switch <b>186</b>, which turns off virtually all of the systems supply components, when the water level in the pit reaches a predetermined maximum level, to avoid overflow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the float for the kill switch <b>186</b> is positioned outside of the float box <b>172</b>, while the float sensors <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, and <b>184</b> are within the float box <b>172</b>. A strainer/cleanout <b>188</b> may be provided at the bottom of the float box <b>172</b>, for maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an alternative embodiment having a pit supply valve <b>196</b> which is mechanically controlled by a float <b>198</b> on the surface of the turbid water within the test pit <b>22</b>. A design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be used for a static level test where the water level is maintained substantially constant, and the volume of water provided into the test pit is measured and recorded periodically (e.g. daily). Unlike the automatic valve <b>162</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which typically will switch between off and on, the valve <b>196</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may operate between a range of a very slow trickle to a full open position, depending on the level of the float <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the drawings show the various measuring components, valves, switches and data recorder/controller connected via wires, other types of links, such as wireless, infrared, etc. may also be used in certain applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a representative wiring diagram for the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although of course various alternatives may be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the motors for the mixers are shown at <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. These may respectively be high, medium and low power mix motors. Switches <b>126</b> switch the motors on or off. The float switch <b>120</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 9</figref>, may directly or indirectly operate the agitator motor controller <b>64</b>, and operation of the tank water supply valve <b>142</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and the auger motor controller <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, the location of the test pit is determined, and the test pit is then constructed, typically via excavation or drilling. In many applications, several test pits may be constructed sufficiently adjacent to each other so that they may be supplied by a single turbid water generator <b>32</b>. Test pit specifications may be specified by government agencies. The test pits may be located at the invert of a proposed drainage basin. The test pit may be pre-saturated with city water, or turbid water, before testing begins, to reduce or avoid the transient effects of dry ground conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once the test pits are constructed, the test system <b>30</b> may be moved into position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the turbid water generator which includes the silt source <b>36</b> and mixing tank <b>90</b>, may be provided on a truck or trailer, so it may be conveniently moved and positioned as needed. Silt <b>38</b> is collected from nearby areas and loaded into the vessel <b>44</b>, e.g., with a front end loader, conveyor belt, or other automatic or manual means. A main water line <b>140</b> is connected to the mixing tank <b>90</b>. A pit line <b>132</b> is connected to the outlet <b>136</b> of the mixing tank <b>90</b>, and positioned to supply turbid water into the test pit <b>22</b>. The float box <b>172</b> is installed in the test pit. If a single turbid water generator is to supply multiple test pits, then additional pit lines and float boxes are installed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system <b>30</b> is set up to obtain accurate data of the percolation rate with turbid water, automatically. Initially, the mixing tank <b>90</b> is filled with city water (clean water) flowing in through the main water line <b>140</b> and then into the mixing tank <b>90</b> via the bottom water supply pipe <b>110</b>, the rotation water supply pipe <b>112</b> and the strainer water supply <b>114</b>. The agitator motor <b>48</b>, vibrator <b>58</b> and auger motor <b>70</b> are turned on. Silt moves down through the vessel into the auger tube <b>74</b>, and out the silt discharge opening <b>80</b>, and into the mixing tank <b>90</b>. The silt supply rate may be adjusted by varying the speed of the auger motor <b>70</b>. This, and the other controls described may be performed manually, or automatically via the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>. The action of the silt agitator <b>46</b> tends to move silt into the auger tube <b>74</b> without open cavities, to allow for more uniformed silt supply rates.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some silt passes through the openings in the strainer <b>92</b>. Other silt which deposits on the strainer may be washed into the mixing tank <b>90</b> via water spray from the strainer spray nozzles <b>116</b>. The strainer helps to distribute the silt over a larger surface of the water in the tank, to promote more uniform mixing and to reduce clumping.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be switched on before the silt source motors <b>48</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>70</b>, so that the silt falls into turbulent water in the mixing tank. Alternatively the mixers may be turned on simultaneously with the silt source motors. The mixers vigorously mix the silt into the water in the mixing tank <b>90</b>, creating turbid water. With the turbid water level within the test pit <b>22</b> below nominal, the pit supply valve <b>162</b> (or <b>196</b>) remains open, with the supply line <b>132</b> supplying turbid water into the pit. As turbid water flows into the pit, city water will ordinarily continue to flow into the mixing tank, and the silt source <b>36</b> will continue to provide silt into the mixing tank <b>90</b>. When the turbid water level within the pit <b>22</b> reaches its nominal test level, the &#x201c;off&#x201d; sensor <b>184</b> sends a signal to the supply valve <b>162</b> and/or controller <b>34</b> causing the valve <b>162</b> to close. City water supply into the mixing tank <b>90</b>, as well as supply of silt <b>38</b> into the mixing valve tank is stopped. These controls may be performed via wiring and relays, or via the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turbid water continuously percolates or diffuses out of the test pit <b>22</b> into the surrounding ground. The percolation rate will vary depending on the ground conditions. For example, in highly porous ground such as ground having a high sand or gravel content, the percolation rate may be high. In contrast, ground having more impermeable materials, such as clay, will tend to have lower percolation rates.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As turbid water percolates out of the test pit <b>22</b>, the water level in the test pit, indicated at <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, drops. The floats <b>185</b> on the float sensors <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, and <b>184</b>, correspondingly move down. When the float <b>185</b> of the float sensor <b>182</b> drops to a specified level, for example, 2 inches below the nominal level, the float sensor <b>182</b> generates a signal closing a latching ON relay <b>146</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. When the relay <b>146</b> closes, the pit supply valve <b>162</b> opens, supplying turbid water into the test pit. The mixers <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are turned on, generally along with the agitator motor <b>48</b>, the auger motor <b>70</b>, and vibrator <b>58</b>. Under certain conditions, the agitator motor <b>48</b>, the vibrator <b>58</b> and/or the mixers, may already be running. The pit supply valve <b>162</b> then opens, optionally after a predetermined delay (to allow time for mixing of silt with water in the mixing tank <b>90</b>, before moving water from the mixing tank <b>90</b> into the test pit <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As turbid water refills the test pit <b>22</b>, the water level rises back up to the nominal level. When the water level reaches the nominal level, the float <b>185</b> on the float sensor <b>184</b> moves up sufficiently to trigger the float sensor <b>184</b>, causing the pit supply valve <b>162</b> to close, and generally also stopping the agitator motor <b>48</b>, auger motor <b>70</b> and vibrator <b>58</b>, optionally after a preset time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The float sensor <b>180</b> may be a continuous output level sensor, providing a continuous electrical output (e.g., 4-20 mA) for logging and monitoring the water level in the test pit. The kill switch <b>186</b> is provided at the top of the float box <b>172</b>, to avoid interfering with testing. In the event that the float sensor <b>184</b> does not operate, the kill switch <b>186</b> turns off power to all components, except for the data recorder/controller <b>34</b>) and closes all valves, to prevent overflow. The system <b>30</b> may continue to operate as described above, with turbid water supplied into the test pit <b>22</b>, as needed, to maintain the water level in the test pit <b>22</b> within a predetermined level of the nominal level.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The flow meter <b>160</b> measures flow, typically volume flow, such as gallons, into the test pit <b>22</b>. The data recorder/controller <b>34</b> has an internal clock, and is linked to the flow meter <b>160</b>. Accordingly, the data recorder/controller <b>34</b> can record flow of turbid water into the test pit, as a function of time, thereby providing a percolation rate. After the test system <b>30</b> is installed, it may run for a pre-set time interval, such as two weeks, to collect data sufficient to accurately determine a percolation rate. Since the test system <b>30</b> is automated, it can run unattended, if necessary. The data recorded in the data recorder/controller <b>34</b> may be processed and prepared for review in text or graphical form. The data may optionally be sent via telemetry to a distant location.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The amount of city water and silt provided into the mixing tank <b>90</b> are adjusted to achieve a desired level of turbidity. In a typical test set up, the flow rates of water and silt are adjusted to obtain a minimum sediment load of 1000 Nepthelonetric turbidly units (NTU). The turbid water generator <b>32</b> (which includes the silt source <b>36</b> and the mixing tank <b>90</b>) may be set to provide higher turbidity, since turbidity levels above the minimum are generally acceptable for test purposes, whereas turbidity levels below the minimum will generally not be acceptable. The turbidity of the turbid water may be measured manually, or automatically, via water samples taken from the test pit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, novel systems and methods have been shown and described. Various changes, substitutions, and use of equivalents may of course be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention, therefore, should not be limited, except by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
