<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The head end surface of an optical fiber (<b>2</b>) and the head end surface of an optical fiber (<b>12</b>) are butted to each other in an alignment member (<b>22</b>) of an adapter (<b>21</b>). In the butting, because one of the members clasping the optical fiber (<b>2</b>) is a plate (<b>4</b><i>a</i>) that is short, the optical fiber (<b>2</b>) is bent and buckled between the left end of the short plate and the right end of the alignment member. Members clasping the optical fiber (<b>12</b>) are a long plate (<b>14</b><i>b</i>) and a V-grooved base plate (<b>13</b>), and the optical fiber (<b>12</b>) is therefore horizontally fixed between each of right ends of the long plate and of the V-grooved base plate (<b>13</b>) and the left end of the alignment member. This results that the head end surface of the optical fiber (<b>2</b>) and the head end surface of the optical fiber (<b>12</b>) are in tight contact with each other, achieving excellent optical transmission between both optical fibers.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a structure for fixing optical fibers in an optical connector.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional optical fiber connecting device will be explained (see, e.g. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2000-19355 (page 3, third paragraph, line 45 to page 4, fifth paragraph, line 15, FIGS. 1-4 and 7-9)).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view of an optical fiber connecting device before connection, in which two optical connectors A and B are connected to each other through an adapter C (shown in a broken fashion). The optical fiber connecting device comprises the first optical connector A, the second optical connector B, the adapter C, two lock springs <b>61</b>, <b>61</b> for locking the first optical connector A and the second optical connector B to the adapter C, respectively, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the first optical connector A and the second optical connector B each comprise tape fibers <b>51</b> each formed by integrally fixing many optical fibers <b>52</b>, arrayed side by side, into a flat plate shape by the use of a synthetic resin or the like, clamp members <b>53</b> each clamping the many optical fibers <b>52</b> that are exposed by removing a cover of the tape fiber <b>51</b> at its end portion, an alignment member <b>54</b> holding the tip end portions of the respective optical fibers <b>52</b> in the state where those tip end portions are aligned, a casing member <b>55</b> holding the clamp members <b>53</b>, the alignment member <b>54</b>, and so on, and a first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>or a second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>detachably held in a recess portion <b>55</b><i>a </i>of the casing member <b>55</b>. The alignment member <b>54</b> is slidable inside the casing member <b>55</b> in an axial direction of the optical fibers <b>52</b>. An elastic member <b>56</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> is provided on the lower side (the side pressing the optical fibers <b>52</b>) of the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the fitting piece, either one of the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, (A) and the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, (B) is selected and used. As will be described later, in the state of being fitted in the recess portion <b>55</b><i>a </i>of the casing member <b>55</b>, the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>is located on the inner side of the casing member <b>55</b> and does not press portions of the optical fibers <b>52</b> located between the clamp members <b>53</b> and the alignment member <b>54</b>. On the other hand, in the same state, the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>is located on the inner side of the casing member <b>55</b> and presses portions of the optical fibers <b>52</b> located between the clamp members <b>53</b> and the alignment member <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> so as to substantially linearly hold the respective optical fibers <b>52</b> at these portions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The adapter C comprises an alignment member <b>57</b> and a casing member <b>58</b> holding the alignment member <b>57</b>. The alignment member <b>57</b> comprises, on its surface, micro-sleeves <b>57</b><i>a </i>into which the optical fibers <b>52</b> are inserted, respectively, a V-groove base plate <b>57</b><i>b </i>having V-grooves formed parallel to each other and holding the micro-sleeves <b>57</b><i>a</i>, respectively, a holding plate <b>57</b><i>c </i>holding the V-groove base plate <b>57</b><i>b</i>, and so on, thereby holding the tip end portions of the optical fibers <b>52</b> in a passable manner. Since it is configured such that the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>or the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>is detachably held in the recess portion <b>55</b><i>a </i>of the casing member <b>55</b> in the first optical connector A or the second optical connector B, bending for obtaining a buckling load (a load that produces a contact force between tip end surfaces of a pair of optical fibers by bending of at least one of the optical fibers) can be produced at each of the optical fibers <b>52</b> of the first optical connector A or the second optical connector B when assembling the optical connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, by using the first fitting pieces <b>56</b><i>a </i>in both optical connectors A and B, the respective optical fibers <b>52</b> of both optical connectors A and B can be bent. Therefore, a buckling load is produced at each of the optical fibers <b>52</b> of both optical connectors A and B so that the end surfaces of the respective optical fibers <b>52</b> of both optical connectors A and B are in pressure contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, by using the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>in the left optical connector A and the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>in the right optical connector B, it is possible to bend only the optical fibers <b>52</b> of the optical connector B. Therefore, a buckling load is produced at each of the optical fibers <b>52</b> of the optical connector B so that the end surfaces of the respective optical fibers <b>52</b> of both optical connectors A and B are in pressure contact with each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the foregoing conventional optical fiber connecting device, selection can be made so as to bend or not to bend the optical fibers <b>52</b> by replacement between the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>and the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the width of each of the fitting pieces <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>is equal to that of the casing member <b>55</b> and, further, the second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>should increase in height because the elastic member <b>56</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> is provided. Therefore, the optical connectors A and B cannot be prevented from increasing in size and, further, the replacement should be performed between the first fitting piece <b>56</b><i>a </i>and the entire second fitting piece <b>56</b><i>b </i>having the elastic member <b>56</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, this invention aims to provide an optical connector that can improve the foregoing drawback of the conventional technique, that can produce bending of each of optical fibers with a simple structure, thereby obtaining a buckling load, and further, that is compact.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the best mode for carrying out this invention, description will be made hereinbelow about one embodiment and its design modifications.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An optical connector of the embodiment of this invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, (A) is a perspective view of the state where one optical connector <b>1</b> is inserted in an adapter <b>21</b> while the other optical connector <b>11</b> is before insertion into the adapter <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, (B) is an exemplary sectional view of the state where both optical connectors <b>1</b> and <b>11</b> are fitted together. Optical fibers <b>2</b> of the optical connector <b>1</b> are clasped between a V-groove base plate <b>3</b> made of a resin and a short plate <b>4</b><i>a</i>. Optical fibers <b>12</b> of the optical connector <b>11</b> are clasped between a V-groove base plate <b>13</b> and a long plate <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Tip end surfaces of the optical fibers <b>2</b> and tip end surfaces of the optical fibers <b>12</b> are butted to each other in an alignment member <b>22</b> of the adapter <b>21</b>. This state is called a physical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this event, since one of the members clasping the optical fibers <b>2</b> is the short plate <b>4</b><i>a</i>, each of the optical fibers <b>2</b> is bent and buckled upward between a left end of the short plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>and a right end of the alignment member <b>22</b> as shown in the figure. Since the members clasping the optical fibers <b>12</b> are the long plate <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the V-groove base plate <b>13</b>, each of the optical fibers <b>12</b> is horizontally fixed between right ends of the long plate <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the V-groove base plate <b>13</b> and a left end of the alignment member <b>22</b>. Therefore, since the tip end surfaces of the optical fibers <b>2</b> and the tip end surfaces of the optical fibers <b>12</b> are in tight contact with each other, excellent light transmission is carried out between the optical fibers <b>2</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Now, the assembly of the optical connector <b>1</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 7</figref>. The optical connector <b>11</b> is the same as the optical connector <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, a housing <b>5</b> comprises a front portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>having a <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.13mm" wi="3.13mm" file="US07641397-20100105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>-frame shape, an intermediate portion <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and a rear portion <b>5</b><i>c </i>serving as an insertion side for many optical fibers <b>2</b> and is integrally formed of a resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The front portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>comprises a left-side portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, a right-side portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, and a bridge portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> connecting between the left-side and right-side portions <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. The left-side and right-side portions <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> are respectively provided with opening portions <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>2</b><i>a </i>for engagement when the optical connector <b>1</b> is inserted into the adapter <b>21</b>, while a passing hole <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b><i>a </i>for the optical fibers <b>2</b> is provided at the center of the bridge portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The V-groove base plate <b>3</b> and the short plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>or the long plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>are placed at the intermediate portion <b>5</b><i>b </i>and the passing hole <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b><i>a</i>. The V-groove base plate <b>3</b> is formed with many V-grooves <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the optical fibers <b>2</b> are inserted from the rear portion <b>5</b><i>c</i>, placed on the grooves <b>3</b><i>a</i>, respectively, and pass through the passing hole <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, (A) and (B), the short plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>or the long plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>is placed on the optical fibers <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, a clamp <b>6</b> of a resin or metal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is fixed so as to cover the intermediate portion <b>5</b><i>b</i>, so that the assembly of the optical connector <b>1</b> is completed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The clamp <b>6</b> has an upper surface portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>provided with a hole <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a spring portion <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> projecting into the hole <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and has both side portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>and <b>6</b><i>c </i>provided with opening portions <b>6</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>6</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, respectively. When the clamp <b>6</b> is placed to cover the intermediate portion <b>5</b><i>b</i>, both opening portions <b>6</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>6</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> are locked by stoppers <b>5</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> provided at both side portions of the intermediate portion <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Further, the spring portion <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> presses the short plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>or the long plate <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the respective optical fibers <b>2</b> are clasped between the corresponding V-grooves <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the V-groove base plate <b>3</b> and the short plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>or the long plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>while being applied with a predetermined force. The tip end surfaces of the respective optical fibers <b>2</b> are aligned so as to slightly project from tip end surfaces of the front portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the case of the short plate <b>4</b><i>a</i>, while, so as to be located substantially flush with the tip end surfaces of the front portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the case of the long plate <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, the bridge portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> of the housing <b>5</b> faces part of the V-groove base plate <b>3</b> and part of the long plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>is inserted between the bridge portion <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> and the V-groove base plate <b>3</b>. Therefore, the long plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>is securely held in the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the V-groove base plate <b>3</b> and the housing <b>5</b> are in the form of separate members in this embodiment, but may be subjected to design change so as to be integrally formed. Further, the clamp <b>6</b> may be subjected to design change so as to be provided with two or more spring portions <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As clear from the foregoing description, the following effects are achieved according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">1. Selection can be made so as to bend or not to bend the respective optical fibers by replacement between the short plate and the long plate. Therefore, it is possible to provide the optical connector that can produce bending of each of the optical fibers with the simple structure to thereby obtain the bucking load and, further, that is compact.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">2. The housing has the bridge portion facing part of the V-groove portion (V-groove base plate <b>3</b>) and, when the long plate is used, part of the long plate is inserted between the bridge portion and the V-groove portion. Therefore, the long plate is securely held in the housing with the simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">3. By integrally forming the V-groove portion (V-groove base plate <b>3</b>) and the housing, the number of parts is reduced, the assembly and disassembly are facilitated, and the cost is reduced. Further, the assembly of the optical connector is completed by causing the V-groove portion to directly hold the optical fibers, placing the plate on the optical fibers, and locking the opening portions provided at the clamp by the stoppers provided at the housing. Therefore, the assembly and disassembly can be easily carried out. Particularly, since this invention is the connector that directly connects the optical fibers, even when the optical fibers need to be replaced, it is possible to deal with it and, further, to achieve a reduction in size of the optical connector.</p>
