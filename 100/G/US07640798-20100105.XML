<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-346565 filed on Dec. 22, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device for detecting a flow rate of fluid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A semiconductor device for detecting a flow rate of fluid is known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 3,468,731 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,490,915.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a semiconductor of this kind, a heating element (heating resistance element) and a temperature sensing element (temperature sensing resistance element) for sensing temperature of a portion around the heating element are formed on a semiconductor substrate, and a flow detector for detecting flow rate of a fluid is constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid (for example, air) contains moisture. When the flow rate of the fluid is detected by the semiconductor device, therefore, an error occurs only by the amount of the moisture content. Such an error is not preferred in uses requiring high-precision flow rate (air volume), particularly, like in fuel injection control of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above-described problem, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a semiconductor device for detecting a flow rate of fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a semiconductor device includes: a semiconductor substrate; a flow sensor having a first heater for detecting a flow rate of fluid; and a humidity sensor for detecting a humidity of the fluid. The flow sensor and the humidity sensor are disposed on the semiconductor substrate. The flow sensor is disposed around the humidity sensor. The humidity sensor is disposed on an upstream side of the first heater.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the above device includes the humidity sensor, moisture in the fluid is compensated so that detection accuracy of the flow rate is improved. Further, the humidity sensor is disposed near the flow sensor, the humidity near the flow sensor is detected by the humidity sensor so that the detection accuracy of the flow rate is much improved. Furthermore, since the humidity sensor and the flow sensor are disposed on the same substrate, the dimensions of the device are minimized. Further, the humidity sensor is not substantially affected by heat generated by a heater in the flow sensor humidity sensor. Thus, the detection accuracy of the flow rate is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a semiconductor device includes: a semiconductor substrate; a flow sensor for detecting a flow rate of fluid; a humidity sensor for detecting a humidity of the fluid; a resin mold for molding a part of the semiconductor substrate; and a lead terminal, a part of which is molded in the resin mold. The flow sensor and the humidity sensor are disposed on another part of the semiconductor substrate so that the flow sensor and the humidity sensor are not covered with the resin mold. The humidity sensor is disposed on an upstream side of the first heater. The semiconductor substrate includes a concavity and a pad. The concavity is disposed opposite to the humidity sensor and the flow sensor. The pad is disposed on the substrate. The humidity sensor and the flow sensor are coupled with the pad so that the humidity sensor and the flow sensor output detection signals through the pad. The pad is coupled with the lead terminal with a wire. The resin mold molds a connection portion between the pad and the wire and the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since the above device includes the humidity sensor, moisture in the fluid is compensated so that detection accuracy of the flow rate is improved. Further, the humidity sensor is disposed near the flow sensor, the humidity near the flow sensor is detected by the humidity sensor so that the detection accuracy of the flow rate is much improved.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing a schematic configuration of a semiconductor device of a first embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic cross section taken along line II-II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged plan view of a portion around a flow sensor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged plan view of a portion around a humidity sensor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic plan view showing the positional relation between a moisture sensitive film and a high polymer film over a semiconductor substrate. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for convenience, a flow sensor and a circuit part are not shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, for convenience, insulating films such as a protection film are not shown. In the following diagrams, a hollow arrow expresses the flow direction of a fluid in normal times.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, on a semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, a flow sensor <b>120</b> for sensing a flow rate of fluid and a humidity sensor <b>130</b> for sensing humidity of the fluid are formed as main components of a semiconductor device <b>100</b>. That is, the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are integrated on a single chip.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The flow sensor <b>120</b> is constructed as a so-called thermal flow sensor. Concretely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a cavity <b>111</b> for flow is formed as a low heat conduction area in a part of a flow sensor formation area in the silicon substrate as the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. A thin portion <b>112</b> (membrane) of an insulting film is formed over the cavity <b>111</b> for flow. More specifically, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is subject to anisotropic etching from the back side of the flow sensor formation face, thereby obtaining the thin portion <b>112</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, smaller one of two rectangular areas surrounded by broken lines is the thin portion <b>112</b>, and the larger area indicates an open face <b>113</b> of the cavity <b>111</b> for flow. The thin portion <b>112</b> is formed much thinner than the other part of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, so that heat capacity is suppressed, and thermal insulation from the other part is assured.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are formed on the thin portion <b>112</b>. The heating element <b>121</b> is an upstream-side heating element disposed on the upstream side in the flow direction of the fluid. The heating element <b>122</b> is a downstream-side heating element disposed on the downstream side in the flow direction of the fluid. A pair of temperature sensing elements <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> as temperature sensing resistors are formed so as to sandwich the pair of heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> in the peripheral area of the thin portion <b>112</b>, which is thicker than the thin portion <b>112</b> and on the upstream side and the downstream side of the fluid, respectively. Each of the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the temperature sensing elements <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> is formed as a part of a wiring part <b>125</b>. The wiring part <b>125</b> also functions as a wiring connected to a circuit part <b>140</b> which will be described later. As the material of the wiring part <b>125</b>, for example, a known wiring material such as polysilicon properly doped with an impurity or a metal such as Pt can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flow sensor <b>120</b> constructed as described above has the function of generating heat according to a current supply amount by the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> of the embodiment and, in addition, the function of sensing the temperature of itself on the basis of a change in the resistance value of itself. On the basis of heat taken by the fluid out of the heat generated by the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> on the upstream side and the downstream side, the flow rate of the fluid is detected. On the basis of the variation in the amount of heat taken by the fluid out of the heat generated by the heating element <b>121</b> on the upstream side and the heating element <b>122</b> on the downstream side, the distribution direction of the fluid is detected. Further, on the basis of the temperature difference between the heating element <b>121</b> on the upstream side and the temperature sensing element <b>123</b> on the upstream side, and the temperature difference between the heating element <b>122</b> on the downstream side and the temperature sensing element <b>124</b> on the downstream side, the amounts of current supplied to the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are controlled. With respect to the details of the flow sensor <b>120</b>, for example, refer to JP-A-2004-205498 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,983,653.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The humidity sensor <b>130</b> is constructed as a so-called capacitance-type humidity sensor. Concretely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, on the same face as the flow sensor formation face, of the silicon substrate as the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, a pair of detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> are formed so as to face each other while being apart from each other via an insulating film (not shown) such as a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film. More specifically, the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> have a comb shape. Adjacent to the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, a pair of reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> is formed so as to face each other while being apart from each other on the same face as the detection electrode formation face. In the embodiment, the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> are formed in the same pattern and made of the same material as that of the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. More specifically, the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> are formed in the comb shape. As the material of the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b>, a known wiring material such as polysilicon properly doped with an impurity or a metal such as Pt, Al, Cu, or Au can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A protection film (not shown) such as a silicon nitride film is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> so as to cover the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b>. On the protection film, a moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> made of a humidity sensitive material such as polyimide is formed so as to cover the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the gaps between the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. When the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> have corrosion resistance against moisture, it is unnecessary to form the protection film.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the humidity sensor <b>130</b> constructed as described above, when moisture penetrates the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b>, since the relative permittivity of moisture is high, the relative permittivity of the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> changes according to the amount of penetrated moisture. As a result, the electrostatic capacity of a capacitor constructed by the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> using the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> as a part of the dielectric changes. On the other hand, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> is not provided on the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> side. Consequently, the electrostatic capacity of a capacitor constructed by the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> does not change or slightly changes. Since the amount of moisture contained in the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> corresponds to the humidity around the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, humidity can be detected from the difference between the electrostatic capacity between the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and the electrostatic capacity between the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, other than the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, the circuit part <b>140</b> is also formed. The circuit part <b>140</b> is constructed by devices such as a MOS transistor and a diode and wires, and is electrically connected to the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>. The circuit part <b>140</b> includes a signal processing circuit for processing signals output from the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> and circuits for generating signals applied to the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> at the time of detection. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for convenience, the circuit part <b>140</b> is shown (the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in an area excluding the formation area of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. The formation area of the circuit part <b>140</b> may be formed except for the cavity <b>111</b> for flow.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Pads <b>150</b> as electrodes are formed at an end of the circuit part <b>140</b> constructed on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. The pad <b>150</b> is connected to a lead <b>160</b> as an external output terminal via a wire <b>170</b>. Therefore, the circuit part <b>140</b> can electrically transmit/receive signals to/from the outside (for example, an external ECU) via the lead <b>160</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is fixed to a supporting member <b>180</b> by, for example, adhesion using the back side of the formation face on which the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> as a mounting face. In the embodiment, the supporting member <b>180</b> is constructed as a part of a lead frame together with the lead <b>160</b>. In a portion corresponding to the cavity <b>111</b> for flow in the supporting member <b>180</b>, a through hole as a communication part <b>181</b> capable of making the fluid communicated between the cavity <b>111</b> for flow and the outside is formed. A part of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> including the pads <b>150</b> and excluding the formation area of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, a part of the supporting member <b>180</b> corresponding to a part of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, and a part of the wire <b>170</b> and the lead <b>160</b> are integrally covered (molded) with an encapsulation resin <b>190</b> such as epoxy resin. In the above-described lead frame, an unnecessary part is removed in a state where the encapsulation resin <b>190</b> is cured so that the lead <b>160</b> and the supporting member <b>180</b> are separated from each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of the embodiment has not only the flow sensor <b>120</b> but also the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, so that the flow rate detection precision can be improved as compared with that in the configuration in which water content in a fluid is not corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Since the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is formed near the formation area of the flow sensor <b>120</b> on the same semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, as compared with the configuration having the humidity sensor constructed on a substrate different from the substrate of the flow sensor <b>120</b>, humidity of a fluid in a position closer to the flow sensor <b>120</b> can be detected. That is, the flow rate detection precision can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed over the same semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the structure can be downsized as compared with the configuration having the humidity sensor formed on the substrate different from that of the flow sensor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The characteristic points other than the point that the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed in one chip, of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First, the layout of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is characterized. For example, when the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is disposed on the downstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b>, it is feared that the fluid which has taken the heat of the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> constructing the flow sensor <b>120</b> gives heat to the humidity sensor <b>130</b> positioned on the downstream side of the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>. That is, the humidity detection precision of the humidity sensor <b>130</b> may deteriorate. In particular, when the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are constructed on the same face side of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the problem tends to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In contrast, in the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed side by side along the fluid flow direction on the same face side of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is provided on the upstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b>. Therefore, when the fluid flows in the normal flow direction, heat conduction via the fluid can be suppressed. As compared with the configuration in which the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is provided on the downstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b>, the influence of heat of the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> exerted on the humidity sensor <b>130</b> can be reduced. That is, the humidity sensor <b>130</b> can detect humidity with higher precision. Thus, at the time of obtaining the flow excluding the moisture content contained in the fluid (true flow) from the detection results of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, the flow detection precision can be further improved. Therefore, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> is suitable for uses requiring high-precision flow rate (air volume) like in fuel injection control of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> as the component of the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is characterized. In the configuration that at least a part of the semiconductor substrate is covered with an encapsulation resin, it is preferable to form a high polymer film of polyimide or the like on a semiconductor substrate to increase the degree of adhesion between the encapsulation resin and the semiconductor substrate. In the embodiment, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> made of polyimide is employed and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> and a high polymer film <b>200</b> made of the same material are integrally formed. Therefore, as compared with the configuration in which the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> and the high polymer film <b>200</b> are made of different materials, the configuration and the manufacturing process can be simplified. Since the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> is integrated with the high polymer film <b>200</b>, the holding power of the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> is increased, and peeling and the like of the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> exposed to the fluid can be suppressed. Further, by the integration, the structure of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> can be also downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment, to eliminate dead space in the formation area of the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> integrated with the high polymer film <b>200</b> in the portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> exposed from the encapsulation resin <b>190</b>, the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed side by side along the fluid flow direction, and the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> forming the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are set as a portion which is covered with the encapsulation resin <b>190</b>. However, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> can be formed anywhere except for the thin portion <b>112</b>. In the case of forming the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> on not only the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> but also the other part (for example, a part of the flow sensor <b>120</b>), the formation area becomes large. Consequently, although the cost increases, manufacturing is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the configuration in which the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> and the high polymer film <b>200</b> are integrally formed, there is the possibility that moisture enters the high polymer film <b>200</b> via the humidity sensitivity film <b>133</b> and the connection portion between the pad <b>150</b> and the lead <b>160</b> corrodes. In the embodiment, polyimide having a mesh structure in which terminals of a molecular chain as a base are connected to each other is employed for the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> and the high polymer film <b>200</b>. Examples of such polyimide include polyimide having a mesh structure obtained by forming a benzene ring by heating polyamide acid terminated with terminal acetylene to cause reaction between acetylene at the terminals at the time of curing, and polyamide obtained by dehydrating and ring-closing polyamide acid having a mesh structure obtained by coupling terminals of a molecular chain as a base. Refer to the details of the polyimide disclosed in JP-A-2003-232765 and 2006-71647. When such polyimide having the mesh structure is employed, swelling of the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b>, which occurs when absorption water coagulates at high temperature under high humidity, can be suppressed. In other words, penetration of moisture to polyimide molecules is suppressed. The high polymer film <b>200</b> is exposed from the encapsulation resin <b>190</b> directly or indirectly via the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b>, and corrosion can be suppressed also in the configuration in which the connection part between the pad <b>150</b> and the lead corrodes due to moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is subject to anisotropic etching from the back side of the flow sensor formation face, thereby forming the cavity <b>111</b> for flow. That is, the open face <b>113</b> of the cavity <b>111</b> for flow is on the back side of the flow sensor formation face of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. However, the configuration of the cavity <b>111</b> for flow is not limited to the example. It is sufficient to form the thin portion <b>112</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cavity <b>111</b> for flow formed by etching the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> from the flow sensor formation face side can be also employed. In this case, since the cavity <b>111</b> for flow is open (not shown) on the flow sensor formation face side, it is unnecessary to provide the communication part <b>181</b> in the supporting member <b>180</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross section showing a modification and corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment, the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed side by side along the fluid flow direction on the same face side of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is provided on the upstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b>. However, even when the arrangement direction of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is not along the fluid flow direction, if the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is on the upstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b> in the flow direction of the fluid, heat conduction via the fluid can be suppressed. The heat conduction via the fluid is mainly with heat from the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> constructing the flow sensor <b>120</b>, so that it is sufficient to provide at least the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> on the downstream side of the humidity sensor <b>130</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the heating element <b>123</b> on the upstream side in the wiring part <b>125</b> as a component of the flow sensor <b>120</b> is provided on the upstream side of the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, and the remaining heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the temperature sensing element <b>124</b> may be provided on the downstream side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a plan view showing a modification and corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the fourth embodiment, the trench <b>114</b> is formed in the configuration shown in the first embodiment. However, by forming the trench <b>114</b> regardless of the positional relation between the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, heat conduction from the flow sensor <b>120</b> to the humidity sensor <b>130</b> via the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> can be suppressed. Therefore, the trench <b>114</b> can be also applied to the modification configurations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) of the first embodiment and the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the fourth embodiment, the trench <b>114</b> is a cavity.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A fifth embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross section showing a schematic configuration of a semiconductor device of the fifth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic plan view showing wiring widths of a heating element and a dehumidification heater in a wiring part.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Since the semiconductor device of the fifth embodiment is largely common to that of the first embodiment, the detailed description of the common parts will not be repeated hereinbelow, and different parts will be described with concentration. The same reference numerals are designated to the same elements as those of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the fifth embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a dehumidification heater <b>136</b> for heating the humidity sensor <b>130</b> by generating heat by passage of current is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. The dehumidification heater <b>136</b> is provided to recover the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> by evaporating the moisture which is captured in the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> due to deterioration in the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b>. The first characteristic is that the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> and the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> constructing the flow sensor <b>120</b> (only the heating element <b>121</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) are integrally formed as the wiring part <b>125</b> made of the same material as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. The second characteristic is that a cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification as a low thermal conduction area is formed also in an area in the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> corresponding to the humidity sensor <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Concretely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the wiring part <b>125</b> including the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> via an insulating film <b>115</b> (for example, a silicon nitride film and a silicon oxide film). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the wiring part <b>125</b> also includes the heating elements <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> as described in the first embodiment. Over the wiring part <b>125</b>, the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> constructing the humidity sensor <b>130</b> are formed via an interlayer insulating film <b>116</b> (for example, a silicon oxide film). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> are also formed in the same plane as the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. Over the detection electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> is formed via a protection film <b>117</b> (for example, a silicon nitride film).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the cavity <b>111</b> for flow and the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification are formed in correspondence with the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b>, respectively. The cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification is formed so as to include the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> in the plane direction of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The cavity <b>111</b> for flow and the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification are formed using the insulating film <b>115</b> as the bottom. The thin portion <b>112</b> and a thin portion <b>119</b> as an insulating film are formed over the cavity <b>111</b> for flow and the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification, respectively. The wiring part <b>125</b> made of, for example, polysilicon doped with an impurity is formed so that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the heating element <b>121</b> having higher temperature is narrower than the dehumidification heater <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, in the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of the fifth embodiment, the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> can be recovered by evaporating the moisture captured in the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> due to deterioration in the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> by the dehumidification heater <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Since the humidifying heater <b>136</b> and the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are constructed as the single wiring part <b>125</b>, the configuration can be simplified and the structure can be downsized. The manufacturing process can be also simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When current is passed to the wiring part <b>125</b>, both of the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> generate heat. Therefore, for example, as described in the first embodiment, when the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is provided on the upstream side of the flow sensor <b>120</b>, to recover the moisture sensitive film <b>133</b> by turning on the dehumidification heater <b>136</b>, since the influence of the heat conduction from the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> to the flow sensor <b>120</b> via the fluid is considerably exerted, it is preferable not to use, for flow rate detection, a signal output from the flow sensor <b>120</b> at the timing when the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> is on. As described in the third embodiment, when the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is provided in parallel with the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the flow of the fluid, processes similar to the above may be performed. Since the influence of heat conduction from the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> to the flow sensor <b>120</b> via the fluid is less than the above, the signal output from the flow sensor <b>120</b> at the timing when the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> is turned on can be also used for flow detection.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the fifth embodiment, by varying the width of the wiring part <b>125</b>, the temperature on the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and that of the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> are made different from each other. Alternatively, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the depth of the cavity <b>111</b> for flow and that of the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification as the low heat conduction areas may be different from each other (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification corresponding to the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> of lower temperature is shallower than the cavity <b>111</b> for flow). With such a configuration, the amount of heat conduction to the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> side in the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and that in the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> are made different from each other and, moreover, the temperature of each of the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> can be made proper. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a cross section showing a modification.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the fifth embodiment, the cavity <b>111</b> for flow is formed as the low thermal conduction area in an area just below the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>, and the cavity <b>118</b> for dehumidification is formed in the area just below the humidity sensor <b>130</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. However, the low thermal conduction area is not limited to the cavity. It is sufficient for the low thermal conduction area to have thermal conductivity lower than that of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. For example, the low thermal conduction area may be formed by a porous member (for example, porous silicon or porous insulating film). For example, one of the low thermal conduction area corresponding to the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and the low thermal conduction area corresponding to the humidity sensor <b>130</b> may be formed as a cavity. In the other area, porous silicon may be disposed. As an example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the low thermal conduction area corresponding to the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> is formed as the cavity <b>111</b> for flow, and the low thermal conduction area corresponding to the humidity sensor <b>130</b> is formed as a porous silicon part <b>210</b> made of porous silicon. Such a porous silicon part <b>210</b> can be formed by, for example, local electrochemical melting reaction. With such a configuration, by making the thermal conductivity vary between the cavity and the porous silicon, the amount of heat conduction to the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> side in the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and that in the dehumidification heater <b>136</b> can be made different from each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a cross section showing a modification.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The configurations in the foregoing embodiments and modifications can be combined.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the embodiment, the silicon substrate is used as an example of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. However, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is not limited to the silicon substrate.</p>

However, to detect the flow of the fluid, it is sufficient for the flow sensor <b>120</b> to have at least the heating elements <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>. Consequently, a configuration including no temperature sensing elements <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> may be also employed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the embodiments, the humidity sensor <b>130</b> has the reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b>. However, a configuration including no reference electrodes <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> may be also employed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the embodiment, the circuit part <b>140</b> is formed together with the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> over the same semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. That is, the circuit part <b>140</b> is formed together with the flow sensor <b>120</b> and the humidity sensor <b>130</b> on one chip. It is also possible to form the circuit part <b>140</b> on a different substrate. In this case, the substrate on which the circuit part <b>140</b> is formed is completely covered with the encapsulation resin <b>190</b>. The function of the circuit part <b>140</b> may be provided (for example, for an external ECU) separately from the semiconductor device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the embodiments, in a state where the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is fixed to the supporting member <b>180</b>, a part of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is covered with the encapsulation resin <b>190</b>. However, a configuration having no supporting member <b>180</b> may be also employed. When the supporting member <b>180</b> is a part of the lead frame as described in the embodiment, positional deviation of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> can be suppressed at the time of covering with the encapsulation resin <b>190</b> (for example, at the time of transfer molding).
