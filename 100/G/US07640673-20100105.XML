<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method is provided for calibrating a sensor pod of a wheel alignment system, the sensor pod including a housing rotatably mounted on a spindle, and an image sensor in the housing having a viewing axis oriented in a direction substantially normal to an axis of rotation of the spindle for imaging a target affixed to an object such as a vehicle wheel. An example of the method includes mounting the pod on a fixture via the pod spindle such that the pod spindle is stationary, and positioning a target to allow imaging of the target with the pod image sensor. The pod is rotated such that its image sensor obtains images of the target in at least two rotational positions, and the images of the target at the at least two rotational positions are processed to determine the location of the axis of rotation of the spindle relative to the image sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates to automotive service systems, such as wheel alignment systems. The present disclosure has particular applicability to wheel alignment systems utilizing a combination of image processing based alignment technologies and one or more other alignment technologies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A current conventional vehicle wheel alignment system uses sensors or heads that are attached to the wheels of a vehicle to measure various angles of the wheels and suspension. These angles are communicated to a host system, where they are used in the calculation of vehicle alignment angles. In the standard conventional aligner configuration, four alignment heads are attached to the wheels of a vehicle. Each sensor head comprises two horizontal or toe measurement sensors and two vertical or camber/pitch sensors. Each sensor head also contains electronics to support overall sensor data acquisition as well as communications with the aligner console, local user input, and local display for status feedback, diagnostics and calibration support. The four sensors and electronics as well as the mechanical housing that makes up each head necessarily is duplicated four times, as there is one for each wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, wheels of motor vehicles have been aligned in some shops using a computer-aided, three-dimensional (3D) machine vision alignment system. In such a system, one or more cameras view targets attached to the wheels of the vehicle, and a computer in the alignment system analyzes the images of the targets to determine wheel position and alignment of the vehicle wheels from the wheel position data. The computer typically guides an operator to properly adjust the wheels for precise alignment, based on calculations obtained from processing of the image data. A wheel alignment system or aligner of this image processing type is sometimes called a &#x201c;3D aligner.&#x201d; An example of a vehicle wheel aligner using such image processing is the Visualiner 3D or &#x201c;V3D&#x201d;, commercially available from John Bean Company of Conway, Ark., a division of Snap-on Incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alternatively, a machine vision wheel alignment system may include a pair of passive heads and a pair of active sensing heads. The passive heads are for mounting on a first pair of wheels of a vehicle to be measured, and the active sensing heads are for mounting on a second pair of wheels of the vehicle. Each passive head includes a target, and each active sensing head includes gravity gauges for measuring caster and camber, and an image sensor for producing image data, including an image of a target of one of the passive heads, when the various heads are mounted on the respective wheels of the vehicle. The system also includes a spatial relationship sensor associated with at least one of the active sensing heads, to enable measurement of the spatial relationship between the active sensing heads when the active sensing heads are mounted on wheels of the vehicle. The system further includes a computer for processing the image data relating to observation of the targets, as well as positional data from the spatial relationship sensor, for computation of at least one measurement of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional sensor-on-vehicle wheel alignment systems are simple to calibrate using well-known calibration fixtures comprising a straight bar and an accurate level. 3D machine vision wheel alignment systems are also calibrated using well-known techniques such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,658 to Jackson et al. Measurement algorithms for both these types of aligners are also well-known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There exists a need for a methodology for easily and efficiently calibrating an alignment measurement system that uses a combination of 3D machine vision and conventional measurement technologies. There also exists a need for measurement techniques for such alignment systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The teachings herein provide calibration techniques for alignment systems utilizing a combination of 3D machine vision and conventional sensors, which calibration techniques are easily carried out in the field using conventional calibration fixtures. The teachings herein also provide alignment methods for use with such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present disclosure, the foregoing and other advantages are achieved in part by a method for calibrating a sensor pod of a wheel alignment system, the sensor pod comprising a housing rotatably mounted on a spindle, and an image sensor in the housing having a viewing axis oriented in a direction substantially normal to an axis of rotation of the spindle for imaging a target affixed to an object such as a vehicle wheel. The method comprises mounting the pod on a fixture via the pod spindle such that the pod spindle is stationary, and positioning a target to allow imaging of the target with the pod image sensor. The pod is rotated such that its image sensor obtains images of the target in at least two rotational positions, and the images of the target at the at least two rotational positions are processed to determine the location of the axis of rotation of the spindle relative to the image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accord with another aspect of the disclosure, a method of aligning the wheels of a motor vehicle comprises attaching a target to each wheel of a first axle of the vehicle, and attaching a sensor pod to each wheel of a second axle of the vehicle, each sensor pod having an image sensor mounted thereon for imaging a corresponding one of the targets. Each wheel of the first axle is rotated while the wheels of the second axle remain stationary such that the image sensors obtain images of their corresponding targets in at least two rotational positions. The images of each target at the at least two rotational positions are processed to determine the orientation of an axis of rotation of each wheel of the first axle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional advantages and other features of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from the practice of the invention. The advantages of the disclosure may be realized and obtained as particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present methodology applies to a wheel alignment system which combines aspects of image processing with one or more other types of measurement technologies. Such a hybrid system uses visible targets; e.g., on passive heads, for two wheels of a vehicle under test, and a combination of optical imaging sensors (e.g., cameras) and other alignment sensors in active sensing heads that attach to two other wheels of the vehicle. Such an alignment system is described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/487,964, filed Jul. 18, 2006, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an alignment system on which the methods of the present disclosure can be carried out. The system features an arrangement of targets and active sensing heads in relation to wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of a vehicle <b>20</b> that is under test; e.g., to measure one or more wheel alignment parameters. Except for the wheels, elements of the vehicle are omitted for ease of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wheel alignment system includes a pair of passive heads <b>21</b> and <b>23</b>, also referred to as &#x201c;targets&#x201d; herein, mounted on respective wheels <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the vehicle, which are front steering wheels in this example. Active sensing heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>, also referred to as &#x201c;sensor pods&#x201d; herein, are adapted for mounting in association with other respective wheels <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the vehicle, in this case the rear wheels. Each active sensing head includes a housing <b>200</b> and an image sensor <b>210</b> for producing image data, which is expected to include an image of a passive target <b>21</b> or <b>23</b> when the various heads are mounted to the respective wheels of the vehicle <b>20</b>. In this first example, the image sensors <b>210</b> in the active sensing heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> are two dimensional (2D) imaging devices, e.g. cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The heads <b>21</b> and <b>23</b> are passive in that they include targets but do not include any sensing elements. Each of the passive heads <b>21</b> and <b>23</b> includes a target of a type that may be observed by one of the image sensors <b>210</b> in the active heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>. A target on a passive head <b>21</b> or <b>23</b>, for image sensing by a sensor on another head, may be active or passive. An active target, such as a light emitting diode (LED), is a source driven by power to emit energy (e.g. IR or visible light) that may be detected by a sensor. A passive target is an element that is not driven by power and does not emit energy for detection by a sensor. Assuming an image sensor in head <b>25</b> or <b>27</b>, a passive target would be an object that reflects (or does not reflect) light or other energy in a manner detectable by the respective image sensor. In the example, although the targets could comprise one or more light emitting elements, the targets comprise light and dark regions that can be detected when illuminated by other sources and imaged by cameras or the like in the active sensing heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A first example of a target that can be used on either of the passive wheel heads <b>21</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In this first example, the target is rectangular. A second example of a target that can be used on either of the passive wheel heads <b>21</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In this second example, the target is circular. In each case, the target consists of a flat plate with a pattern of differently sized circles marked on or mounted on the surface of the plate in a pre-determined format and pattern. Although specific patterns are shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, it will be evident that a large number of different patterns can be used on each target. For example, a larger or smaller number of dots may be included and other sizes and shapes can be used for the dots. As another example, multifaceted plates or objects can also be used for the targets. Many examples utilize a number of retro-reflective elements arranged to form each target. For further information, attention is directed to U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,743 to Jackson.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The system also includes a spatial relationship sensor associated with at least one of the active sensing heads <b>25</b> or <b>27</b>. The spatial relationship sensor enables measurement of the spatial relationship between the active sensing heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> when the active sensing heads are mounted on wheels of the vehicle. In general, spatial relationship sensors may measure relative position and/or orientation, depending on the type of sensor used. A positional measurement refers to the relative position of the measured item from the perspective or in the coordinate system of the measuring device. Measurement of position generally uses a standard coordinate system such as Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates. Orientation may be derived from a three-dimensional position measurement, or orientation may be measured independently of position. Orientation relates to the rotational position of the measured device with respect to the measuring device expressed in a standard coordinate system. Orientation is generally expressed in rotational angles in three orthogonal reference planes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be readily apparent to someone skilled in the art that the wheel alignment systems discussed herein may be implemented with various different types of spatial relationship sensors. In this example, the system uses two conventional one-dimensional (1D) angle sensors <b>230</b> to measure the relative angles of the active sensing heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>, in the toe plane.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The active heads <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> also contain conventional gravity sensors or the like to measure tilt, typically camber and pitch, of the head. In this first example, the head <b>25</b> includes one or more tilt sensors <b>220</b>; and the head <b>27</b> includes one or more tilt sensors <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system also includes a computer (not shown) in communication with the active sensing heads for processing image data relating to observation of the targets and tilt data, from the active sensing heads. The computer also processes spatial relationship data from the at least one spatial relationship sensor. The data processing enables computation of at least one measurement of the vehicle. The computer is for carrying out the processing steps of the methods described herein electronically.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Measurement using image processing techniques is fundamentally different than using conventional angle measurement technology in a wheel alignment system. Although basic image processing techniques are known to those skilled in the art, a brief description is presented for clarity. The image of a body varies according to the perspective from which such body is viewed and the variation in the image is directly related to and determinable from the perspective angle of the view path along which the body is viewed. Furthermore it is known that it is possible to determine the perspective angles at which an object is viewed merely by relating the perspective image of that object with a true non-perspective image thereof. Conversely put, it is possible to determine the angles at which an object is oriented to a view path (or a plane perpendicular thereto) by comparing a perspective image of an object with a non-perspective image thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In practice, a mathematical representation, or data corresponding to a true image (i.e. an image taken by viewing the target perpendicularly to its primary plane) and the dimensions of the target are preprogrammed into the memory of the computer so that, during the alignment process, the computer has a reference image to which the viewed perspective images of the targets can be compared.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The way that the computer calculates the orientation of the target is to identify certain geometric characteristics on the target, take perspective measurements of these and compare these measurements with the true image previously preprogrammed into the memory of the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, since the true dimensions of the target are preprogrammed into the memory of the computer, the method and apparatus of this invention can be used to determine the exact position of the wheels in three-dimensional space. This can be done by firstly determining the perspective image of certain of the elements of the pattern on the target (for example, the distances between circles) and comparing the dimensions of this image to the true dimensions of those elements. This will yield the distance that the element and, accordingly, the target is from the image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For the wheel alignment system discussed herein, the image sensor in the active head views a target attached to a wheel and produces image data which describes a perspective image of the target. The computer correlates the perspective image data for the target with the true shape of the target. In so doing, the computer relates the dimensions of certain known geometric elements of the target with the dimensions of corresponding elements in the perspective image. Thus, by moving the wheel/target assembly to a plurality of positions, imaging the target at those positions, and then performing certain trigonometric calculations (or by any other suitable mathematical or numerical methods), the computer calculates the alignment of the wheel of the vehicle. The computer can also calculate the three-dimensional orientation of the axis of rotation of the wheel (wheel axis) associated with the passive target.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For additional information regarding measurement based on processing of images of targets, attention again is directed to U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,743 to Jackson, as well as to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,943,783; 5,535,522; and 6,148,528 to Jackson, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,658 to Jackson et al., the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One of the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pod includes a housing <b>200</b> into which is mounted the two-dimensional camera <b>210</b> (e.g., a conventional video camera), the gravity gauge <b>220</b> for measuring camber and pitch (i.e., caster), the one-dimensional cross-toe sensor <b>230</b>, and a cross-toe target (not shown). The pod also includes a spindle <b>240</b> to which the housing <b>200</b> is rotatably mounted, and a rotational sensor <b>250</b>. The pod is attached to a wheel clamp assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>via the spindle shaft <b>240</b>, so the housing <b>200</b> can rotate about the axis of rotation A of the spindle <b>240</b> relative to the clamp assembly <b>300</b>. This rotation is measured by the rotational sensor <b>250</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>shows the sensor pod and clamp assembly <b>300</b> attached to a vehicle tire/wheel assembly <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this example, the axis of the spindle <b>240</b> is approximately perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the vehicle when it and the clamp assembly <b>300</b> is mounted to the vehicle, and the viewing axis of the camera <b>210</b> is mounted in the housing oriented in a direction substantially normal to the spindle's axis of rotation for imaging a target affixed to a wheel on the same side of the vehicle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Therefore, the housing <b>200</b> rotates about the spindle <b>240</b> under the influence of gravity, so that the camera <b>210</b> points toward the target if the vehicle wheel <b>335</b> to which it is mounted rotates, and can still image the target on the wheel ahead of it.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cross-toe sensor <b>230</b> is oriented along the spindle <b>240</b> axis of rotation for sensing the cross-toe target of another sensor pod mounted on a wheel on the opposing side of the vehicle. The conventional cross-toe sensor <b>230</b> is a one-dimensional array of sensing elements (e.g., CCDs) with a slit in front of it, which faces across the vehicle to an optical cross-toe target on the other pod, such as an LED. The angle between the two pods is calculated in a conventional manner based on which sensing elements are illuminated by the LED target.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Prior to performing a wheel alignment procedure using the above-described system, a calibration procedure must be carried out to orient the sensors of the sensor pod to each other. An example of such a calibration procedure will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During calibration, the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> are attached to a fixture known as a &#x201c;zero bar&#x201d; <b>400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. This calibration fixture <b>400</b> can be one used for calibrating sensor pods of conventional non-visual alignment systems. The fixture <b>400</b> includes vertical members <b>410</b> and a rigid crossbar <b>420</b> rotatably mounted to the vertical members <b>410</b>. The crossbar <b>420</b> supports the pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> via their spindles <b>240</b> such that the spindles <b>240</b> are substantially concentric to each other, thus their axes of rotation A are the same. Since the pod housings <b>200</b> are rotatably mounted on their spindles <b>240</b>, the housings <b>200</b> are free to rotate about their respective spindles <b>240</b> under the influence of gravity, so that when disposed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, their cameras <b>210</b> point toward the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> as the crossbar <b>420</b> is rotated. The fixture <b>400</b> is mounted across a conventional alignment rack (not shown) so the crossbar <b>420</b> is substantially parallel to the surface of the rack. The crossbar <b>420</b> is considered &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; for calibration purposes because it is rigid, and mounted at a known height above the alignment rack.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are placed so each of them is in the field of view of one of the cameras <b>210</b>. In the illustrated example, targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are mounted to a conventional calibration fixture <b>500</b> during the calibration process, and placed on the alignment rack (not shown) such that the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> face the pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> and each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> can be imaged by the camera <b>210</b> of the pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> on the same side of the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To begin the calibration procedure, the location of each pod's spindle <b>240</b> in its camera <b>210</b>'s coordinate system is determined. This is accomplished by rotating the pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> such that its image sensor <b>210</b> (i.e., camera) obtains images of its corresponding target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in at least two rotational positions; and processing the images of the target at the at least two rotational positions, as by the computer using a well-known axis of rotation calculation formula, to determine the location of the axis of rotation A of the spindle <b>240</b> relative to the image sensor <b>210</b>. After calibration, the spindle axis A is the reference coordinate system for alignment measurements and calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one exemplary calibration technique, the pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> and standard targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are mounted on their respective calibration bars, and each pod is calibrated independent of the other pod. Each pod housing <b>200</b> is rotated so its corresponding target is near the top of the camera <b>210</b>'s field of view, the target is imaged, then the housing <b>200</b> is rotated so the target is near the bottom of the camera <b>210</b>'s field of view, and the target is imaged again. The images are then processed in a conventional manner by the computer to calculate the axis of rotation A of the spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When employing this technique, the accuracy of the axis of rotation calculation is improved as the angle of rotation of the pod housing <b>200</b>, and hence the camera <b>210</b>, increases. A standard target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, which is typically 2 feet square or less, will only allow an angle of rotation of the camera of about 15 degrees. To increase this angle, in another example a larger target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, such as an 8-foot long target, is employed to increase the camera angle of rotation to about 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The use of a large target is, however, disadvantageous in the field due to its size and cost. Therefore, in a further example, a calibration target <b>600</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is mounted on fixture <b>500</b> instead of targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>. Target <b>600</b> comprises a straight bar <b>610</b> of a desired length with an optical element (target) <b>620</b>, <b>630</b> at each of its two distal ends. The positions of the optical elements <b>620</b>, <b>630</b> relative to each other are known. The calibration target <b>600</b> is mounted to one end of the target calibration fixture <b>500</b>, and the bar is positioned so a pod camera <b>210</b> can be rotated to image one target <b>620</b>, and then rotated to image the other target <b>630</b>, through a relatively large angle of rotation such as 45 degrees. The at least two images are then processed as in the other discussed examples to calculate the axis of rotation A of the pod spindle <b>240</b>. This technique is advantageous because it can be used in the field, since the bar <b>610</b> and optical elements <b>620</b>, <b>630</b> are relatively small, light, and inexpensive. For example, the optical elements <b>620</b>, <b>630</b> can be 8 inches and 12 inches high, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The rotational sensor <b>250</b> can also be calibrated with the pods and targets mounted to their respective calibration fixtures; for example, at the same time as the location of the spindle <b>240</b> is determined. To calibrate the rotational sensor <b>250</b>, a rotational sensor measurement is obtained at each of the (at least two) rotational positions of the pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> where the target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> is imaged, and a measured angular spindle rotation is determined based on the obtained sensor measurements. The images of the target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the at least two rotational positions are then processed to determine a calculated angular spindle rotation, and the measured angular spindle rotation is compared to the calculated angular spindle rotation. If the measured angle of rotation is different than the calculated angle of rotation, the difference between them is used to calibrate the rotational sensor <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the location of the spindle axis A is determined, the locations of the other sensors in the pod (i.e., the gravity gauges <b>220</b> and the cross-toe gauge <b>230</b>) are determined with respect to the spindle <b>240</b>. Regarding the gravity gauges <b>220</b>, they are typically calibrated at the factory with respect to gravity using a conventional technique of mounting them on a known level jig, noting the gauge readings, and subtracting those readings from the gauges' subsequent measurements to get a true reading with respect to gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To calibrate the camber gauge of each pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> with respect to the alignment rack, the sensor pods are mounted to a rigid, rotatable calibration bar <b>420</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and the calibration fixture <b>400</b> is placed across the alignment rack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Since the fixture <b>400</b> is parallel to the alignment rack, the rack will become the zero reference for camber (i.e., left/right tilt), even if the rack is not perfectly level. The camber gauge readings are noted, then the bar <b>420</b> is rotated to a plurality of different positions (e.g., four positions) to eliminate the effect of runout of the bar <b>420</b>, and measurements are taken from the camber gauges <b>220</b> at each of the rotational positions. The sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> will remain level during this procedure because they are rotatably mounted to the fixture <b>400</b>. The camber gauge measurements at each of the rotational positions are processed in a conventional manner to obtain a zero camber reference value for each pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cross-toe sensor <b>230</b> of each pod can be calibrated at the same time as the camber gauges. Each cross-toe sensor <b>230</b> senses the cross-toe target <b>230</b><i>a </i>of the opposing sensor pod at each of the rotational positions (e.g., the four positions) of the bar <b>420</b>. The resulting data relating to the cross-toe targets <b>230</b><i>a </i>is then processed in a conventional manner to determine the zero toe reference value of each respective cross-toe sensor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gravity caster gauge <b>220</b>, also called a &#x201c;pitch gauge,&#x201d; is typically calibrated at the factory, using a substantially horizontal (i.e., level) alignment rack. The pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> are mounted on the calibration fixture <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the fixture <b>400</b> is placed across one end of the level alignment rack so that the pod cameras <b>210</b> are facing towards the other end of the alignment rack, and targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are mounted, so they can be imaged by the cameras <b>210</b>, on conventional turntables <b>550</b> instead of fixture <b>500</b>. The turntables are adjusted in a well-known manner so their axis of rotation is substantially vertical, as by leveling the turntable in two directions. In another example, the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are rotatably mounted on a vertical spindle instead of a turntable; e.g., a spindle mounted to a vertical fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> is rotated such that its corresponding pod camera <b>210</b> obtains images of the target in at least two rotational positions; e.g., at least 30 degrees apart. The images of each target at the at least two rotational positions are processed in a conventional manner to determine the location of the axis of rotation of each target, respectively. The location of the axis of rotation of each target is then processed using well-known mathematical principles to obtain a zero caster reference value for each pod, respectively. In other words, since each pitch gauge has a particular non-zero value, when the gauge <b>220</b> reads that non-zero value, it is known that the actual caster is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a further example according to the present disclosure, the gravity camber gauges <b>220</b> of the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> are calibrated at the same time as the gravity pitch gauges <b>220</b>; that is, using a level alignment rack. In this example, the location of the axis of rotation of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> mounted on a vertical turntable <b>550</b> is processed to obtain a zero camber reference value for each pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, respectively. Because the rack is level, this technique determines the camber with respect to gravity, not with respect to the alignment rack (as did the first camber gauge calibration method discussed hereinabove). Thus, field calibration of camber is eliminated in this example; the user of the alignment system is simply instructed to make sure their alignment rack is level, and no further camber calibration will be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After all the sensors in the pods have been calibrated, the system is ready to perform alignment measurements on a vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> is attached to each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of a first axle of the vehicle; i.e., the front wheels of the vehicle, via a wheel clamp such as wheel clamp assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a sensor pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> is attached to each wheel <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of a second axle of the vehicle; i.e., the rear wheels of the vehicle, as by using a clamp assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Since the spindles <b>240</b> of the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> are typically not parallel to the centers of the vehicle wheels due to the clamp configuration, the orientation of each spindle must be determined relative to the center of the wheel <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> to which it is attached. This is called &#x201c;runout&#x201d; and is calculated using a conventional procedure wherein the vehicle is jacked up off its wheels, and each wheel <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is rotated to three positions, approximately 120 degrees apart. At each position, the change in each pod's camber gauge reading is noted, along with the spindle rotational sensor <b>250</b> reading. A well-known mathematical algorithm is then used to calculate the runout at each wheel <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The output of the runout procedure is a sine curve whose magnitude is the angle between the wheel spindle and the pod spindle <b>240</b>, and whose origin is represented by an angular value (i.e., where the curve starts on the rotation of the wheel). Thus, a correction factor can be applied to camber and toe readings based on the rotational sensor reading at any given wheel/clamp assembly location.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A runout procedure is also conducted on the front wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> where the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are mounted. The vehicle is jacked up off its tires, and the rear wheels <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> (on which the sensor pods are mounted) are kept stationary. Each front wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is rotated such that the camera <b>210</b> of each sensor pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> obtains images of their corresponding targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in at least two rotational positions. The images of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the plurality of rotation positions are then processed to determine the location of the axis of rotation of each front wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. In this case, the location of the wheel with respect to the target can be determined because the target is rigidly mounted to the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The wheels of the vehicle are thereafter placed on the alignment rack, and alignment measurements taken. Rear wheel camber is calculated in a conventional manner by starting with the camber gauge <b>220</b> reading, correcting for runout (i.e., the difference in location between the wheel spindle and the pod spindle <b>240</b>), and correcting for the difference between the camber gauge reading and gravity previously determined in the above-described calibration procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Individual rear wheel toe is determined using total toe obtained by the cross-toe sensors <b>230</b> of the pods, and the geometric center line of the vehicle. Total toe is determined in a conventional manner by sensing the cross-toe targets <b>230</b><i>a </i>with the cross-toe sensors <b>230</b>. The geometric center line is determined by locating each of the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in space, assigning a point P in space relative to each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, and calculating the vector from each rear pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> to its corresponding point P. More particularly, each target is imaged with their corresponding pod camera to determine their position in space, then a point P relative to the target is assigned with respect to a known point on the wheel clamp <b>300</b>. This is called the &#x201c;claw point.&#x201d; A vector is then calculated between each pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> and the corresponding claw point P. The individual toe measurement for each rear wheel is calculated based on the vector for each wheel's corresponding side of the vehicle and the total toe.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Camber and toe of the front wheels are determined by calculating the position and orientation of each front wheel spindle with respect to their corresponding pod camera <b>210</b>, as by performing the front wheel runout procedure discussed hereinabove. Rotation of the front wheel spindle about a vertical axis indicates the toe of the wheel, and the tilt of the wheel spindle with respect to a horizontal plane indicates the camber of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Caster of the front wheels is determined using a similar technique, by determining the position of the steering axis SA of each front wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> with respect to its corresponding sensor pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>. In this methodology according the present disclosure, the front wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are steered while they are prevented from turning on their axle (i.e., their spindles), as by applying the vehicle's brakes, while the rear wheels <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> carrying the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> remain stationary. The cameras <b>210</b> of the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> obtain images of their corresponding target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in at least two steered positions. The images of each target at the at least two steered positions are then processed to determine the location of the steering axis SA of each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> using well-known mathematical equations. Caster (i.e., the fore/aft tilt of the steering axis compared to a vertical plane) for each wheel can then be easily derived in a known manner. In addition to caster, the same images of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the at least two steered positions can also be processed to determine steering axis inclination (SAI), which is the in/out tilt of the steering axis SA compared to a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in another example of the present methodology, a &#x201c;two-wheel alignment&#x201d; is carried out on only one pair of opposing wheels of one axle of a vehicle, such as the front wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. This provides a less expensive alignment for the vehicle owner, since it takes less time to perform. In this example, a target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> is attached to each of the pair of wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to be aligned, and instead of attaching the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> to the rear wheels <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> via wheel clamps <b>300</b> as shown, the sensor pods are positioned (not necessarily mounted via their spindles <b>240</b>) on the alignment rack to allow imaging of one of the targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> with each pod image sensor (camera <b>210</b>), and to allow sensing of the cross-toe target <b>230</b><i>a </i>of each pod by the cross-toe sensor <b>230</b> of the other pod.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to be aligned is then rotated, as by pushing the vehicle on the rack, such that the cameras <b>210</b> obtain images of their corresponding targets <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in at least two rotational positions while the pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> remain stationary. The images of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the at least two rotational positions are processed to determine an image-derived toe of each wheel to be aligned. Cross-toe is determined in a conventional manner by sensing of the cross-toe targets <b>230</b><i>a </i>using the cross-toe sensors <b>230</b> as explained hereinabove. The total toe of the wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to be aligned is then calculated based on the image-derived toe of each wheel and the cross-toe of the pods; e.g., by adding the image-derived toe of each wheel to the cross-toe value. Note that the individual toe of each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> cannot be calculated in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To determine the camber of each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, the images of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the at least two rotational positions are processed to determine an image-derived camber of each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> relative to its corresponding camera <b>210</b>. A measurement of each camber gauge <b>220</b> is also obtained. The camber of each of the wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is then calculated based on the image-derived camber of each wheel and the corresponding pod's camber gauge measurement; for example, the difference of the image-derived camber of wheel <b>24</b> and the reading of the camber gauge <b>220</b> of sensor pod <b>27</b> is the true camber of wheel <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Caster of the front wheels is determined using a similar technique, by determining the position of the steering axis SA of each front wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> with respect to its corresponding sensor pod <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>. In this methodology according the present disclosure, the front wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are steered while they are prevented from turning on their axle (i.e., their spindles), as by applying the vehicle's brakes, while the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> remain stationary. The cameras <b>210</b> of the sensor pods <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> obtain images of their corresponding target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> in at least two steered positions. The images of each target at the at least two steered positions are then processed to determine the location of the steering axis SA of each wheel <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> using well-known mathematical equations. Caster (i.e., the fore/aft tilt of the steering axis compared to a vertical plane) for each wheel can then be easily derived in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to caster, the same images of each target <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> at the at least two steered positions can also be processed to determine SAI. The same images can be processed, along with a measurement of the vehicle wheel diameter (determined in a known manner based on the images of the targets in the at least two rotational positions), to determine &#x201c;caster trail&#x201d;, which is the fore/aft distance between the center of the vehicle's tire where it contacts the alignment rack (i.e., the ground) and the point where the steering axis SA intersects the alignment rack. A related measurement that can be determined at the same time is called &#x201c;scrub radius&#x201d;, and is the in/out distance (i.e., a distance transverse the longitudinal axis of the vehicle) between the center of the vehicle's tire where it contacts the alignment rack and the point where the steering axis SA intersects the alignment rack. The above-mentioned determinations of vehicle wheel dimensions, scrub radius, etc. are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,532,062; 6,661,505; and 6,237,234 to Jackson, the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The ability to determine caster trail is advantageous because it can be used to diagnose and solve problems of &#x201c;pull&#x201d; of the vehicle that cannot be easily diagnosed using caster readings alone. For example, caster on both front wheels of a vehicle may be equal, and the vehicle will nevertheless pull. If caster trail is measured and found to be out of specification on one side, caster on that wheel can be adjusted to correct the caster trail and eliminate the pull.</p>
