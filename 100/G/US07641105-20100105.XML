<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to automated banking machines. Specifically this invention relates to automated banking machines that dispense financial instrument sheets to users of the machines. This invention further relates to improved user interfaces for such automated banking machines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The common type of automated banking machine used by consumers is an automated teller machine (&#x201c;ATM&#x201d;). ATMs enable customers to carry out banking transactions. Banking transactions carried out using ATMs may include the dispensing of cash, the making of deposits, the transfer of funds between account and account balance inquiries. The types of banking transactions a customer can carry out are determined by the capabilities of the particular banking machine and the programming of the institution operating the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other types of automated banking machines may be operated by merchants to carry out commercial transactions. These transactions may include, for example, the acceptance of deposit bags, the receipt of checks or other financial instruments, the dispensing of rolled coin or other transactions required by merchants. Still other types of automated banking machines may be used by service providers in a transaction environment such as at a bank to carry out financial transactions. Such transactions may include for example, the counting and storage of currency notes or other financial instrument sheets, the dispensing of notes or other sheets, the imaging of checks or other financial instruments, and other types of service provider transactions. For purposes of this disclosure an automated banking machine shall be deemed to include any machine that may be used to carry out transactions involving transfers of value.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus there exists a need for automated banking machines with improved properties including properties related to security and service capabilities.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that has improved capabilities for handling financial instrument sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine which provides enhanced security.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that facilitates user operation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that has improved weather resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that provides improved service access.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that provides a concealment device adapted to cover an input keypad.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to provide an automated banking machine that provides a user with indirect viewing of manual engagement with an input device, such as a keypad, to blocking viewing of inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further objects of exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be made apparent in the following Best Modes for Carrying Out Invention and the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain of the foregoing objects are accomplished in an exemplary embodiment of the invention by an automated banking machine which is an automated teller machine (&#x201c;ATM&#x201d;). The ATM includes a user interface which includes input devices for receiving identifying inputs that identify user accounts, as well as inputs from users that cause the machine to carry out transaction functions. The user interface further includes one or more output devices that output indicia such as instructions for a user in operating the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The exemplary embodiment includes a cash dispenser mechanism. The exemplary embodiment further includes a cash acceptor mechanism that is capable of receiving a stack of documents from a user. In the exemplary embodiment the stack of documents may include a stack of notes of various denominations or a stack comprising mixed types of financial instrument sheets such as notes and checks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some exemplary embodiments currency sheets accepted by the cash acceptor mechanism are stored in selected compartments. This enables storing of each type of sheet in a particular compartment. In some embodiments mechanisms are provided for re-dispensing such sheets from the compartment so as to enable recycling of valid sheets. In alternative embodiments sheets that have been validated by the cash accepting mechanism are stored in one or more storage containers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some exemplary embodiments the user interface of the machine is provided with horizontally disposed convex mirrors positioned vertically above the user interface. Such mirrors are positioned so as to facilitate the ability of a user of the machine to view an area behind and otherwise near the user. This reduces the risk of persons in proximity to the user not being observed by the user carrying out transactions at the machine. The exemplary horizontally disposed convex mirrors are further positioned outward relative to a light which illuminates the user interface to facilitate the user's operation. This reduces the risk of glare and facilitates the user's ability to view the area observable in the mirrors. In some exemplary embodiments provision may be made to sense a need for cleaning of one or more mirrors and to provide built in cleaning mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other exemplary embodiments, a user input device such as a keypad, may be concealed from direct viewing by a concealment device. The concealment device may include a body adapted to cover a keypad to prevent viewing of a user's input, such as a PIN, by another. The body includes a hand entry opening to allow manual digit access to the keys of the keypad. The exemplary concealment device includes an indirect viewing mechanism utilizing two mirrors to direct an image of the keypad toward a viewing portal. In some exemplary embodiments, the concealment device may be selectively positioned in a covering position wherein the keypad may be viewed indirectly and only by a user of the machine, and an uncovered position allowing direct viewing of the keypad or access for cleaning or other purposes. The concealment device may include a lighting mechanism to provide illumination of the interior of the concealment device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further aspects of the exemplary embodiments will be made apparent in the following detailed description. It should be understood that the features described are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>, ATM <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>46</b> which extends generally on an interior side of wall <b>14</b>. Housing <b>46</b> includes a chest portion <b>48</b>. In the exemplary embodiment chest portion <b>48</b> is a generally secure chest which has a safe-like access door <b>50</b>. Access to the interior of the chest portion is limited to authorized personnel through a suitable locking mechanism schematically indicated <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In the exemplary embodiment the chest is generally L-shaped in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Housing <b>46</b> further includes an upper portion <b>54</b>. Upper housing portion <b>54</b> which is in connection with the fascia, is in supporting connection with the chest portion <b>48</b>. In the exemplary embodiment upper housing portion <b>54</b> has in association therewith, access doors <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>. Access to the upper housing portion is controlled by one or more locking mechanisms in operative connection with access doors <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> as represented by key locks <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the secure chest portion <b>48</b> is used to house financial instrument sheets such as currency notes, checks and other valuable sheets. The upper housing portion <b>54</b> is generally used to house components of the machine that do not hold on an extended basis notes or other financial instrument documents which can be redeemed for value. Of course it should be understood that the construction of ATM <b>10</b> is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ATM <b>10</b> includes at least one controller schematically indicated <b>64</b>. In the exemplary embodiment controller <b>64</b> includes at least one processor and is in operative connection with at least one data store schematically indicated <b>66</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the data store is operative to hold data representative of instructions such as computer programs, configuration parameters, data about transactions conducted and other information that may be usable in the operation of the ATM <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Controller <b>64</b> is in operative connection with numerous transaction function devices within the ATM, and is operative to control the operation thereof in accordance with its programming. Controller <b>64</b> is shown schematically in operative connection with devices <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>. It should be understood that this representation is schematic only and is intended merely to represent numerous components within the machine which are in operative connection with the controller. For example the transaction function devices may include moving devices such as motors, solenoids and other devices that are operative to impart motion to components. Likewise transaction function devices may include sensors such as radiation sensors, proximity sensors, switches and other types of sensors that are operative to sense items, users, conditions, properties, characteristics or components within the ATM and to enable a controller to perform functions in accordance with its programming. Transaction function devices include output devices such as sound emitters and light emitting devices. For example and without limitation, transaction function devices may include the card reader, display, keyboard, function keys, printer, cash dispenser, cash acceptor, storage mechanisms and other devices previously discussed as well as other devices within the machine which are operative in response to the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the exemplary embodiment the controller is also in operative connection with a communications device schematically indicated <b>74</b>. The communications device is operative to communicate messages electronically between the ATM <b>10</b> and other computers in financial transaction processing systems. These may include for example communications with systems operated by banks, credit card networks, automated clearinghouses and other entities. The approaches described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,963,333 which is incorporated herein by reference, may be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the communications device <b>74</b> in the ATM <b>10</b> is schematically shown as providing communication with a financial institution <b>76</b> through a network <b>78</b>. It should be understood that this communication configuration is exemplary and in other embodiments other communication arrangements may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, in the operative position of ATM <b>10</b> the housing <b>46</b> houses a sheet acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> which is also referred to herein as a cash acceptor mechanism. In the exemplary embodiment the mechanism <b>80</b> is operative to accept sheets from a machine user through the opening <b>40</b>, to analyze each sheet for at least one property or characteristic, and to route the sheets selectively for storage within the housing of the machine based on the characteristics analyzed. It should be understood that in various embodiments these sheets may include currency notes, checks or other financial instrument sheets. It should further be understood that in exemplary embodiments the financial instrument sheets may be sheets comprised of different types of material such as paper, plastic or combinations thereof. It should further be understood that references herein to a cash acceptor mechanism shall be deemed to encompass mechanisms which handle not only currency notes, but also other financial instrument sheets such as checks, money orders, gift certificates, vouchers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> includes a chute <b>82</b> which extends through opening <b>40</b> in fascia <b>15</b> in its operative condition. As previously discussed the user accessible opening to chute <b>82</b> is controlled by a movable gate <b>44</b>. Gate <b>44</b> moves responsive to the controller <b>64</b> and enables authorized users to access the chute at appropriate times during transaction sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In operation of the machine users are enabled to insert a stack of financial instrument sheets schematically indicated <b>84</b>, into the chute. The stack <b>84</b> may comprise currency notes, checks or other forms of financial instrument sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In operation of the cash acceptor mechanism sheets are individually separated from the stack by a picker mechanism <b>86</b>, an exemplary embodiment of which is later discussed in detail. Each picked sheet is transported individually from the picker mechanism past the validator device schematically indicated <b>88</b>. The validator device <b>88</b> of the exemplary embodiment is operative to determine at least one characteristic of each sheet. This may include for example a determination as to whether the sheet is a note or check and if a note, the denomination and whether it is valid. If the document is a check, a determination may be made as to whether the check is genuine as well as the indicia associated with the maker of the check and the amount thereof. For example in some exemplary embodiments the validating device may be of the type shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,923,415, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively or additionally a validating device having features disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,554,185, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, may be used. Of course in other embodiments other types of validating devices such as imagers, readers, sensors and combinations thereof may be used. For example, in some embodiments the sheet accepting device may be operative to image instruments such as checks and provide data which can be stored and transmitted as an electronic reproduction of that check. In such circumstances an electronic reproduction of the check may be transmitted to remote locations so as to facilitate review and validation of the check. Alternatively or in addition, the electronic representation of the check may serve as a substitute for the physical paper check which thereafter enables the paper check to be cancelled and subsequently destroyed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the exemplary embodiment of the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>, sheets which have been analyzed through operation of the validator device <b>88</b> are moved through a transport <b>90</b> to a routing device <b>92</b>. The routing device is operative responsive to the controller <b>64</b> to route sheets selectively to either an escrow device <b>94</b> or to a transport <b>96</b>. Escrow device <b>94</b> generally operates to hold sheets in storage on a temporary basis. Such an escrow device may be of the type shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,371,368, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Escrow device <b>94</b> may be operative to accept sheets and store them. Thereafter responsive to operation of the controller <b>64</b> the escrow device may deliver those sheets to the routing device <b>92</b> which directs them along sheet paths in the machine to carry out transactions. Of course it should be understood that the escrow device shown is exemplary and in other embodiments other types of escrow devices may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the exemplary embodiment transport <b>96</b> is used to receive unacceptable sheets which have characteristics that do not satisfy certain parameters set by the machine. These may include for example, notes which have one or more characteristics which suggest that they are counterfeit. In other embodiments such sheets may include checks which have properties which suggest that they are reproductions or forged or otherwise unacceptable. Of course in other embodiments other sheets may be deemed unacceptable. As schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sheet acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> is operated to cause transport <b>96</b> to deposit suspect sheets schematically indicated <b>98</b> in a storage area <b>100</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the suspect sheets are stored within the cash acceptor mechanism and outside of the secure chest so that they may be recovered by servicing personnel in a manner that is later discussed. Of course this approach is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the exemplary embodiment the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> is operative responsive to signals from the controller <b>64</b> to cause financial instrument sheets that are determined to be valid or otherwise acceptable, to be directed through a cash accepting opening <b>102</b> that extends in an upper surface <b>104</b> of the chest. In the operative position of the cash acceptor mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the transport in the cash acceptor mechanism is aligned with the cash accepting opening and a transport <b>108</b> that extends into the secure chest. As schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the operative position of the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> at least one driving member <b>110</b> of the transport <b>106</b> is in operative connection with a driven member <b>112</b> of the transport <b>108</b>. In the exemplary embodiment this enables the cash acceptor mechanism to transmit movement to sheet handling mechanisms within the secure chest and to assure coordinated movement of processed sheets therein. Further in the exemplary embodiment the driving and driven members extend in the cash accepting opening so as to block access therethrough by unauthorized persons as later discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the exemplary embodiment when the cash acceptor mechanism is moved from the operative position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to a servicing position such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, the driving member <b>110</b> and the driven member <b>112</b> disengage. In some exemplary embodiments the movement of the cash acceptor mechanism from the operative position to a servicing position may include movably mounting the cash acceptor mechanism such that the mechanism moves both upward away from the secure chest so as to disengage the driving and driven members as well as outward for purposes of servicing. Of course to return the cash acceptor mechanism to the operative position, movement thereof is made both inward and downward so as to reengage the driving and driven members. This may be accomplished by a combination of slides, rollers or other suitable mechanisms. Of course the approach described of providing for engagement between the cash acceptor mechanism and a mechanism for handling sheets within a chest portion is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used, or the transport within the chest portion may have a separate motor or other moving device.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, transport <b>108</b> which moves sheets generally in a vertical direction through the cash accepting opening is in operative connection with a horizontal transport schematically indicated <b>114</b>. The horizontal transport is operative to engage sheets moved into the chest portion and to move them transversely away from the cash accepting opening. The horizontally extending transport <b>114</b> is in operative connection with a vertically extending transport <b>116</b> which is transversely disposed from the cash accepting opening in the secure chest.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Vertical transport <b>116</b> is operative to move sheets selectively into engagement with sheet handling mechanisms <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. In some exemplary embodiments, sheet handling mechanisms <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may be sheet stacking mechanisms such as those shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Alternatively or in addition in other embodiments one or more of the sheet handling mechanisms may include sheet receiving and dispensing mechanisms which are operative to selectively accept sheets for storage as well as to dispense sheets therefrom. Examples of sheet accepting and stacking mechanisms as well as sheet accepting, stacking and dispensing mechanisms which may be used in some exemplary embodiments are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,302,393 and 6,290,070, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the exemplary sheet accepting and stacking mechanism <b>118</b> is selectively operative to accept a sheet <b>126</b> moving in the vertical transport <b>116</b>. Sheet <b>126</b> is guided to engage the sheet handling mechanism <b>118</b> through movement of a gate member <b>128</b>. The gate member moves responsive to the controller <b>64</b> to direct the leading edge of the sheet into a recess <b>130</b> of a rotatable member <b>132</b>. As the leading edge of the sheet <b>126</b> enters the recess <b>130</b> the rotatable member <b>132</b> rotates in the direction of Arrow R. This causes the gripper portion bounding the recess <b>130</b> to move inwardly capturing the sheet <b>126</b> therein. The rotatable member <b>132</b> rotates until the leading edge of the sheet <b>126</b> engages a stop surface <b>136</b> at which time the gripper portion <b>134</b> has moved radially outward such that the sheet disengages from the rotatable member <b>132</b> and is integrated into a sheet stack <b>138</b>. Stack <b>138</b> may be for example a stack of currency notes all of which are of the same denomination. Of course in other embodiments the stack <b>138</b> may be a collection of other types of sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the exemplary embodiment the stack is maintained in abutting relation with the rotatable member by a biasing plate <b>140</b> which acts against the back of the stack. The biasing plate <b>140</b> is movable responsive to a biasing mechanism <b>142</b> which is operative to enable the stack to increase or decrease while maintaining the sheets in an appropriately aligned position. Further details related to an exemplary embodiment of the sheet handling mechanism are described in the incorporated disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,393.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows the exemplary operation of exemplary sheet handling mechanisms <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>. In this case a sheet <b>142</b> moving in transport <b>116</b> is enabled to pass the rotatable member <b>132</b> when the gate member <b>128</b> remains retracted as the sheet passes. This enables the sheet to move to other sheet handling mechanisms such as sheet handling mechanism <b>120</b>. This arrangement enables sheets having particular characteristics to be stored together, for example, valid currency notes of different denominations to be collected in stacked relation in selected sheet storage areas. Alternatively in other embodiments sheets of similar types such as checks may be segregated from other financial instrument sheets such as notes or travelers checks. In still other embodiments sheets which are to be recycled such as suitable fit currency notes can be segregated from valid yet worn or soiled currency notes which are not suitable for providing to customers. It should be understood that these approaches are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a security plate <b>144</b> extends within the secure chest in intermediate relation between the horizontal transport <b>114</b> and the note storage mechanism such as the storage area <b>146</b> associated with sheet handling mechanism <b>118</b>. The security plate <b>144</b> in the exemplary embodiment is secured within the interior of the secure chest and is adapted to prevent unauthorized access through the cash accepting opening <b>102</b> in the chest. This may be accomplished by securing the security plate <b>144</b> to the walls bounding the interior of the secure chest or other suitable structures. As can be appreciated in the exemplary embodiment the upper housing portion <b>54</b> houses the sheet acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>, it is generally easier to access the area housing the sheet acceptor mechanism than the secure chest. In cases where criminals may attack ATM <b>10</b> and attempt to remove the sheet accepting mechanism, ready access through the cash accepting opening is first blocked by the driving and driven members and other components of the transports <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. However, in the event that criminals attempt to clear away the transport mechanism components, access to the stored sheets in the note storage mechanisms is still blocked by the security plate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows greater detail of the cash acceptor mechanism <b>180</b> retracted to a servicing position so as to expose the cash accepting opening. In the exemplary embodiment the cash acceptor mechanism is movably mounted in supporting connection with the chest portion on suitable slides or other members. As can be appreciated in this exemplary embodiment the security plate <b>144</b> operates to separate the cash accepting opening <b>102</b> from the notes or other valuable financial instrument sheets which are stored below the security plate within the secure chest. Of course the security plate is exemplary and other forms of security plates or other structures may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternative embodiment the ATM includes a bulk storage container <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> for holding currency bills, notes, checks or other items that have been deposited into the machine. The container <b>260</b> includes a top wall <b>262</b> with an opening <b>264</b> which corresponds to opening <b>102</b> in the chest when the container <b>260</b> is in the operative position. Container <b>260</b> includes a transport <b>266</b> which transports items that pass through the opening <b>264</b> into an interior area <b>268</b> of the container. A horizontal transport <b>270</b> is operative to move deposited items transversely away from the opening <b>264</b>. A security plate <b>272</b> is positioned to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the interior area <b>268</b>. A further transport <b>274</b> is operative to move deposit items such as currency sheet <b>276</b> to a suitable location for being dispatched into the interior area <b>268</b> below the security plate. Deposited items schematically represented <b>278</b> are held within the interior area of the container <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the exemplary embodiment the container <b>260</b> includes a bottom wall <b>280</b>. The interior area <b>268</b> is bounded by a shaker member <b>282</b> that is disposed vertically above the bottom wall. In the exemplary embodiment the shaker member comprises a resilient flexible membrane <b>284</b>. A rigid plate <b>286</b> extends in underlying relation of a central portion of the membrane. Flexible supports <b>288</b> support the rigid plate <b>286</b> above the bottom wall <b>280</b>. The flexible supports further enable movement of the rigid plate and membrane relative to the bottom wall. In exemplary embodiments the rigid supports <b>288</b> may include springs or other members which enable relative vertical and/or horizontal movement of the bottom wall and the rigid plate.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the exemplary embodiment an actuator <b>290</b> extends in intermediate relation between the bottom wall and the rigid plate. In exemplary embodiments the actuator is an electrical vibrating device which is operative to shake the rigid plate and overlying membrane. The shaking action of the actuator <b>290</b> is operative to impart shaking motion to the deposited items <b>278</b> that are in supporting connection with the membrane. This facilitates the dispersal and settling of deposited items and enables a relatively larger quantity of such items to be collected within the interior area <b>268</b> before such items need to be removed. In the exemplary embodiment the actuator <b>290</b> is electrically connected to the circuitry within the machine through a releasable connector <b>292</b>. This facilitates removal of the exemplary container as hereafter discussed. In addition, in some embodiments the moving devices for transports within the container may be supplied with signals and/or electrical power through the releasable connector.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In operation of the machine, the interior area <b>268</b> of the container <b>260</b> is in operative connection with the opening <b>38</b> in the housing of the machine through which deposited items are accepted. The deposited items are passed through the cash accepting mechanism or other mechanism for processing such items. Items appropriate for deposit in the container are passed through the opening <b>102</b> in the top of the chest. Such items are transported by the transports <b>266</b>, <b>270</b> and <b>274</b> to the area below the secure plate <b>272</b> and accumulate within the interior area <b>268</b>. Periodically responsive to the controller, the actuator <b>290</b> operates to impart shaking motion to the deposited items <b>278</b> within the interior area. This facilitates settling of the items so as to densely pack the items therein. Sensors <b>294</b> may be included within the interior area so as to sense the deposited items. The controller may be operative to cause the actuator to shake deposited items responsive to the sensing the level of such items by the sensors. Alternatively the controller may be operative to shake deposited items based on elapsed time, number of items deposited, or other programmable bases. In the exemplary embodiment the sensors <b>294</b> may be in operative connection with the controller through the releasable connector <b>292</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The exemplary container <b>260</b> is removably mounted within the secure chest. The exemplary container is supported on rollable supports <b>296</b>. The rollable supports <b>296</b> may be castors, wheels, ball rollers or other type items that enable more ready movement of the container in a loaded condition. In the exemplary embodiment upon opening of the secure chest the container <b>260</b> is enabled to move outward from the chest. This is facilitated by a servicer grasping a handle <b>298</b> which is attached to the container. The releasable connector <b>292</b> is enabled to be disconnected so that the container <b>260</b> can be pulled outward from the secure chest. As shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment the handle <b>298</b> is a telescoping handle that is enabled to be moved upward once the handle has cleared the secure chest. This facilitates moving the container outside of the ATM. Thereafter the container may be moved to a suitable location by the handle away from the ATM for purposes of removing the contents. This may be, for example, an area within a vault or other secure room in which the items within the container may be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the container <b>260</b> in the exemplary embodiment includes a door <b>300</b>. Access to door <b>300</b> is controlled by one or more locks represented <b>302</b>. In the exemplary embodiment door <b>300</b> is shown hinged at a side toward the chest door so as to reduce the risk of persons obtaining unauthorized access to the interior of the container when the container is within the machine. Once the container has been moved to a suitable location, the lock <b>302</b> may be unlocked; the door opened, and deposited items removed. After the items have been removed, the door <b>300</b> may be returned to the closed position. Thereafter the container may be reinstalled in the machine with the handle <b>298</b> being retracted so as to enable the container to again be aligned with opening <b>102</b>. Further, the releasable connector <b>292</b> may be reconnected so as to again enable operation of the container within the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As can be appreciated, the exemplary container <b>260</b> is enabled to hold a substantial quantity of deposited items. Further, the construction including the rollable supports and telescoping handle facilitates movement of the loaded container out of the ATM and the container into the ATM. It should be understood that the container is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used. These may include, for example and without limitation, containers which include multiple interior areas in which deposited items are supported on shaking members. Such embodiments may achieve, for example, a separation of deposited notes, checks and/or envelopes by denomination or deposit type, and achieve more densely packed storage within a particular interior compartment within the container. In addition or in the alternative, in other embodiments shaking members may be provided on side walls or on top walls bounding the container so as to facilitate the shaking of deposited items and the packing and storage thereof. In addition or in the alternative, containers may be used in some embodiments in conjunction with sheet handling mechanisms such that certain sheets are stored precisely positioned in containers for purposes of stacking and/or recycling while other sheets are stored in bulk within a container or compartment within a container. These alternatives are encompassed within the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 10</figref> schematically describe an exemplary embodiment of the picker mechanism <b>86</b> used in the cash accepting mechanism <b>80</b>. In this exemplary embodiment the stack of sheets <b>84</b> is positioned in the chute <b>82</b> and is in supporting connection with a generally angled lower surface <b>148</b>. Moving members <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are operative to engage the stack and selectively rotate responsive to a motor or other mechanism in the direction of Arrow P so as to move the stack into generally abutting relation with an engaging surface <b>154</b>. Positioned adjacent to the engaging surface <b>154</b> in proximity to the lower surface <b>158</b> is an idler roll <b>156</b> which is a generally free wheeling roll. The engagement of the stack <b>84</b> of the engaging surface <b>154</b> and the face of the roll <b>156</b> is operative to splay the sheets as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The picker mechanism <b>86</b> further includes a generally cylindrical picking member <b>158</b>. Picking member <b>158</b> is rotatable selectively by a motor or other driving member responsive to the controller <b>64</b>. The picking member during picking operation rotates in the direction of Arrow P as shown. Picking member <b>158</b> further includes high friction arcuate segments <b>160</b> which in the exemplary embodiment serve as sheet engaging portions and which extend about a portion of the circumference of the picking member.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Picker mechanism <b>86</b> of the exemplary embodiment further includes a plurality of rolls <b>162</b> that serve as non-contact stripper rolls in a manner later discussed. The picking mechanism further includes a contact stripper roll <b>164</b> which biasingly engages the high friction segments <b>160</b> of the picking member.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the picking member is a generally cylindrical member that includes a plurality of annular recesses <b>166</b>. The outer surface of the non-contact stripper rolls <b>162</b> extend into a corresponding annular recess <b>166</b>, but are generally not in stripping engagement therewith. As represented in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the outer surface of the non-contact stripper rolls <b>162</b> are disposed slightly away from the base of the annular recess. As a consequence the outer surface of the non-contact stripper rolls which serve as a first stripper portion are not positioned to be in direct contact stripping engagement with the picking member. However, because the surface of such rolls is disposed in close proximity thereto and generally enables only a single sheet to pass between the picking member and the non-contact stripper rolls, the separation of a single sheet from other sheets is generally achieved. It should be understood however that while in the exemplary embodiment the non-contact stripper rolls are disposed slightly from the picking member, in other embodiments such rolls or other stripper members may operate to actually contact the picking member but may be of such resilient consistency or other properties that the rolls are not in a biased contact stripping engagement as is the case with the contact stripper roll <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the contact stripper roll is biased to engage a central sheet engaging portion <b>168</b> of the picking member. This central sheet engaging portion is generally centered with regard to sheets that are moved by the picker mechanism <b>86</b>. This reduces the tendency of sheets to twist or skew as they are being moved in the picker mechanism. Of course it should be understood that this arrangement is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The operation of the exemplary picker mechanism <b>86</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. The picker mechanism is operative to separate sheets individually from the stack <b>84</b>. This is done by sequentially picking a first sheet <b>170</b> which bounds the lower end of the stack while moving the first sheet in a first direction generally indicated by Arrow F so as to move the sheet away from the stack. To accomplish this, the controller <b>64</b> operates motors or other moving mechanisms to cause the moving members <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> to rotate as the picker mechanism <b>168</b> similarly rotates in a counterclockwise direction as shown. The rotation of the picking member causes the high friction arcuate segments <b>160</b> which serve as sheet engaging portions to engage a lower face of the first sheet and pull the sheet in intermediate relation between the picking member and the non-contact stripper rolls <b>162</b>. As the first sheet is moved the idler roll <b>156</b> rotates to facilitate the movement of the first sheet between the picking member and the non-contact stripper rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The non-contact stripper rolls <b>162</b> are in operative connection with a one-way clutch <b>172</b> such that the first stripper rolls remain stationary when the first sheet is engaged therewith and moving in the direction of Arrow F. Because the resistance force provided by the non-contact stripper rolls against the face of the sheet engaged therewith is less than the moving force imparted to the opposed face of the sheet, the first sheet <b>170</b> is moved into intermediate relation between the picking member and the non-contact stripper rolls. This causes the sheet to assume the cross-sectional wave configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. This is caused by the sheet being deformed by the non-contact stripper rolls into the annular recesses <b>166</b> of the picker member. This cross-sectional wave configuration is generally operative in combination with the opposing force applied by the non-contact stripper rolls, to separate the first sheet from other sheets that may be moving therewith from the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As the first sheet <b>170</b> moves further in the direction of Arrow F as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the leading edge of the sheet then engages the contact stripper roll <b>164</b> which is biased to engage the sheet engaging portions of the picking member. The contact stripper roll is also in operative connection with a one-way clutch <b>174</b> such that in the exemplary embodiment the contact stripper roll remains stationary as the first sheet moves in the direction of Arrow F. The engagement of the contact stripper roll and the first sheet operates to displace the contact stripper roll so as to enable the sheet <b>170</b> to move in intermediate relation between the contact stripper roll and the central sheet engaging portion <b>168</b>. The resistance force of the non-contact stripper roll is generally operative to separate any sheets other than the first sheet <b>170</b> from moving in the direction of Arrow F.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the sensor <b>176</b> is positioned adjacent to the contact stripper roll in the exemplary embodiment. Sensor <b>176</b> is operative to sense the presence of double sheets which may have been able to pass the non-contact and contact stripper rolls. Suitable sensors in some embodiments may be those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,241,244 and 6,242,733, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Upon sensing a double sheet the controller of the machine is enabled to make additional attempts to strip the sheet as later discussed. However, in the event that only a single sheet is sensed the picker member <b>158</b> continues moving in the counterclockwise direction until the leading edge of the sheet reaches takeaway rolls <b>178</b>. In the exemplary embodiment takeaway rolls are operative to engage the sheet and to move the sheet in the cash accepting mechanism toward the validator device <b>88</b>. In the exemplary embodiment one rotation of the picking member is operative to separate one sheet from the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the event that the sensor <b>176</b> senses that a double sheet or other multiple sheet has been able to pass the contact and non-contact stripper rolls, the controller of this exemplary embodiment is operative to stop the movement of the picker member <b>158</b> in the counterclockwise direction as shown prior to the first sheet <b>170</b> being disengaged therefrom. Thereafter the controller is operative to reverse the direction of the picker member <b>158</b> and the moving members <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> so as to move the first sheet back toward the stack. Through the operation of one-way clutches <b>172</b> and <b>174</b> the contact stripper roll <b>164</b> and the non-contact stripper rolls <b>162</b> are enabled to rotate in a counterclockwise direction as shown so as to facilitate the return of the sheets to the stack. Thereafter the controller may operate the picker mechanism <b>86</b> to again pick a single bill. Repeated attempts may be made until a single sheet is separated from the stack so that it may be processed by the cash acceptor mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It has been found that the exemplary embodiment of the picker mechanism <b>86</b> is well adapted for separating various types of financial instrument sheets having different properties. In general, sheets such as currency notes that are new or other types of sheets which have generally consistent properties of rigidity and friction from sheet to sheet are separated through the operation of the picker mechanism and the non-contact stripper rolls. However, in situations where rigidity and frictional properties vary substantially from sheet to sheet, the contacting stripper roll which subsequently engages the sheets after they have engaged the non-contact stripper rolls is effective in separating sheets that would not otherwise be separated. This may be particularly helpful for example in processing sheets that may include plastic and paper currency notes, checks or other documents that have significantly variable properties and which are mixed together in a stack from which the sheets must be individually picked.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It should be understood that while picking rolls and cylindrical members are used in the exemplary embodiment, in other embodiments other picking and stripping structures such as belts, pads, fingers and other members may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The exemplary embodiment of ATM <b>10</b> comprises a through-the-wall type machine in which the fascia is exposed to the elements. As a result, rain and snow may impact on the fascia and in the absence of suitable measures may enter the machine. As can be appreciated the cash accepting opening <b>40</b> in the fascia must be sufficiently large to accept the chute <b>82</b> which holds a stack of documents <b>84</b> as previously discussed. During transactions when an authorized user indicates that they wish to insert the stack of sheets into the chute, the gate <b>44</b> must be opened which results in exposure of the chute to the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">To minimize the risk posed by rain and snow to the currency acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>, the exemplary embodiment includes the capability to capture and direct from the machine moisture which may enter the chute. The approach used in the exemplary embodiment is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 19</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the lower surface of the chute <b>148</b> includes at least one water accepting opening <b>180</b> therein. In the exemplary embodiment the water accepting opening comprises one or more troughs which extend transversely across the lower surface of the sheet. Of course in other embodiments other approaches may be used. The fluid accepting openings are in fluid connection with a conduit schematically represented <b>182</b> which is in fluid connection with a drain <b>184</b> which delivers the water outside the ATM. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> the trough <b>180</b> is in operative connection with a fluid fitting <b>184</b> which connects to a generally flexible fluid conduit <b>182</b> such as a tube. The conduit <b>182</b> connects to the drain <b>184</b> which in the exemplary embodiment includes a cavity at a lower side of the fascia and which includes openings through which the water may drain to the outside of the machine housing.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the exemplary embodiment a tube support <b>186</b> is positioned to control the direction of the tube and assure drainage when the cash acceptor mechanism is in the operative position as well as when the cash acceptor mechanism is in a service position such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment the tube support minimizes the risk of the fluid conduit being crimped or otherwise assuming a position which prevents the drainage of water from the interior of the chute to the outside of the machine. It should be understood, however, that the approach shown is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the exemplary embodiment, provision is made to minimize the risk of moisture entering the ATM in the area of the cash accepting opening through which the chute <b>82</b> extends in the operative position of the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment a resilient gasket <b>188</b> extends in surrounding relation of the chute <b>82</b> in the area adjacent to the fascia. The resilient gasket is supported on a front face of the cash acceptor mechanism. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> is positioned such that the chute extends through the cash acceptor opening <b>40</b> in the fascia, the resilient gasket is positioned in sandwiched fluid tight relation between the front face of the cash acceptor mechanism and the interior face of the fascia. As the seal provided by the gasket extends in surrounding relation of the chute, the risk of moisture or other contaminants entering the ATM through the cash acceptor opening is minimized. Of course it should be understood that this approach is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> in response to operation of the validator device <b>88</b> and the controller <b>64</b> determines at least one characteristic indicative of whether financial instrument sheets are acceptable to the machine. In the exemplary embodiment unacceptable sheets may be suspect sheets such as potentially counterfeit notes, invalid checks or other unacceptable documents. When such documents are detected, they are directed to a storage area <b>100</b> which in the exemplary embodiment is within the cash acceptor mechanism and outside the chest portion. Periodically these unacceptable sheets must be recovered by servicing personnel for purposes of either verifying the invalidity of the sheets or for purposes of tracing the sheets to the user who placed them in the machine. In the exemplary embodiment such sheets are recoverable by authorized persons who have access to the upper housing portion <b>54</b> but who may be prevented from having access to the chest <b>48</b> where documents determined to be valid are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the exemplary embodiment access to the storage area <b>100</b> is controlled by a suitable access device. In one form of such an access device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an opening <b>190</b> is provided to the storage area <b>100</b>. Access to the opening is controlled by a flip-down access door <b>192</b>. In some embodiments, the flip-down access door <b>192</b> may be opened only when the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> has been moved rearward to extend outside of the housing subsequent to opening access door <b>58</b>. In some embodiments the flip-down access door may be provided with a locking mechanism <b>194</b> such as a key lock or other suitable locking mechanism. As a result in this exemplary embodiment in order to access the sheets in the storage area <b>100</b>, the user could be required to have the necessary capabilities through keys, combinations or otherwise to unlock both lock <b>62</b> on access door <b>58</b> as well as lock <b>194</b> and flip-down door <b>192</b> in order to access the sheets. It should be understood, however, that although in the embodiment shown the cash acceptor mechanism <b>180</b> is shown retracted out of the machine to facilitate opening the flip-down door and extracting the sheets, in other embodiments the flip-down door may be sized, segmented or otherwise adapted such that the cash acceptor mechanism may not need to be retracted from its operative position in order to access sheets in the storage area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows yet a further alternative for accessing sheets in the storage area <b>100</b>. In this exemplary embodiment an opening <b>196</b> is provided through the storage area so as to enable access to the sheets therein. Access through opening <b>196</b> is provided to a sliding door <b>198</b>. Door <b>198</b> is operative to slide along the direction of Arrow S in opposed tracks, slots or other suitable mechanisms for holding and guiding the door in supporting connection with the cash acceptor mechanism. In some embodiments door <b>198</b> may include a locking mechanism <b>200</b>. Locking mechanism <b>200</b> may be a suitable key, combination or other locking mechanism for assuring that only authorized personnel are enabled to access the documents in the storage area. As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, door <b>198</b> may be both unlocked and opened without having to retract the cash accepting mechanism rearward. In some embodiments this may serve to speed servicing and the removal of invalid sheets from the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows yet another exemplary embodiment for accessing sheets in the storage area <b>100</b>. In this embodiment an opening <b>202</b> is provided in a rear face of the cash accepting mechanism <b>80</b>. Access to opening <b>202</b> is controlled by a door <b>204</b>. In the exemplary embodiment door <b>204</b> is a sliding door adapted to be selectively moved in tracks, slots or similar devices. In some embodiments a suitable locking mechanism schematically indicated <b>206</b> is used to assure that only authorized personnel have access to the door. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a transport <b>208</b> is provided for moving the sheets in the storage area <b>100</b> to the service personnel through the opening <b>202</b>. A transport <b>208</b> may be operative in response to input provided to input devices by the servicing personnel or may be automatic responsive to the opening of the door <b>204</b>. Of course it should be understood that all of the approaches shown are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some exemplary embodiments suspect notes or other documents are correlated with particular transactions conducted at the machine and/or with particular users of the machine. This may be accomplished through operation of the validator and the controller. In some exemplary embodiments the suspect documents in storage may be arranged in a particular order and the controller is operative to provide one or more outputs such as through a screen or a printer indicating the transactions and/or users which correspond to the suspect sheets. Alternatively or in addition, provisions may be made for the cash acceptor mechanism to be in operative connection with a printer which prints transaction and/or user identifying information on each of the suspect sheets. This may include for example, visible or non-visible indicia. In some embodiments the indicia may be removable such as removable labels or indicia that can be washed off or otherwise removed or neutralized. In other embodiment the characteristics determined by the validator may be such that the data is sufficiently detailed and of types that create a unique electronic profile of each suspect sheet. This data can be stored at the machine in a data store through operation of the controller or elsewhere in a connected data store. This sheet identifying data may then later be used by a servicer or other persons recovering or analyzing the suspect sheets to correlate each sheet with the transaction and/or user that provided the sheet to the machine. This may be done in some embodiments by putting the machine controller in a mode for such analysis and feeding each suspect sheet through the cash acceptor mechanism. The controller may then operate to correlate the stored data related to the transaction and/or user with the stored data that uniquely identifies the sheet. Such information is then provided to a user of the machine recovering the sheets. Alternatively, such analysis may be conducted by transferring data away from the machine along with the suspect sheets, and conducting the analysis at another validator. Of course these approaches are exemplary of approaches that may be used to uniquely identify a suspect sheet and associate it with a user and/or a transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the exemplary embodiment of the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>, it is desirable to maintain the interior components of the cash acceptor mechanism isolated and in sealed relation except when access is required for servicing. As can be appreciated, while the exemplary embodiment positions the cash acceptor mechanism in intermediate relation between a vertically extending wall of the generally L-shaped chest and the wall of the housing to provide enhanced security, it also presents challenges for servicing. While the ability of the exemplary embodiment to move the cash acceptor mechanism rearward through a service opening of the ATM facilitates servicing, problems are still potentially presented by the need to have to remove cover panels and the like. Further, there is always a risk that cover panels, once removed, will not be replaced resulting in infiltration of contaminants to the cash acceptor mechanism and causing malfunctions or failures.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To reduce the risk of service persons not replacing service panels, the exemplary embodiments of the invention are made to minimize the risk that service panels will be removed and not replaced. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in one exemplary embodiment a side service panel <b>210</b> is mounted in hinged relation in supporting connection with the cash acceptor mechanism. This enables the service panel <b>210</b> to be opened once the cash acceptor mechanism has been moved rearward from the machine. This enables ready access to the components within the machine. In addition in this exemplary embodiment, the front service panel <b>212</b> is mounted in hinged relation adjacent the front of the cash acceptor mechanism. This front service panel enables access to components accessible through a front opening of the cash accepting mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As can be appreciated because of the hinged character of service panels <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, the panels may be readily opened. However, the hinged mounting makes it difficult for a technician to entirely remove the panels from the machine. Further the cash acceptor mechanism cannot be returned to service without closing the service panels. Of course as can be appreciated, suitable latching mechanisms or other holding devices may be used so as to assure that once the service panels are returned to their closed position, they remain therein until such time as the service panels need to be opened again for servicing.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows yet a further schematic view of an alternative approach to providing service panels on the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> that provide protection for internal components and yet can be readily removed for servicing. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, service panels <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> are provided such that they can move in the direction indicated by the adjacent arrows. Service panels <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> in the exemplary embodiment are mounted in channels, slots or other suitable devices on the cash acceptor mechanism for guiding and holding the panels in position. The useful aspect of the service panels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is that the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> need not be removed from the operative position in order to open the interior of the mechanism by moving the service panel. Indeed in the exemplary embodiment, service panel <b>214</b> may be entirely removed exposing the components of the cash acceptor mechanism without moving the cash acceptor mechanism from the operative position. Service panel <b>216</b> which may include the front face supporting the resilient gasket, may be made more readily removable by moving the gasket relative to the chute. The ability to remove service panels may be particularly useful in situations where a service person needs to observe the cash acceptor mechanism in operation in order to diagnose and remedy certain problems.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments it may be desirable to include devices to assure that the service panels <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> are reinstalled on the cash acceptor mechanism after servicing procedures are completed. This may be accomplished by including contact switches such as the contact switch schematically represented as <b>218</b> to sense when the service panels have been placed back in position. Such contact switches may limit the operation of the cash acceptor mechanism until such panels are replaced. Alternatively the circuitry within the ATM may cause an alarm or other indication to be given or may disable operation of the currency acceptor mechanism if the access doors to the upper housing are closed and the service panels have not been returned to their operative position. Of course other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As can be appreciated, the arrangements of service panels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> for the cash acceptor mechanism are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the exemplary ATM <b>10</b> there is also included a mechanism for dispensing cash through the cash dispensing opening <b>38</b> in the fascia. This cash dispensing mechanism generally indicated <b>220</b> is schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment the cash dispensing mechanism is positioned in the higher side of the generally L-shaped chest and includes a plurality of note storage areas <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. In some exemplary embodiments the note storage areas may be housed within removable currency cassettes which are suitable for holding notes and which may be readily removed from the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the exemplary embodiment each of the note storage areas is in operative connection with a picker mechanism <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>. Each of these picker mechanisms are selectively operative responsive to controller <b>64</b> to selectively dispense notes or other sheets from the corresponding storage area responsive to appropriate inputs to input devices of the user interface. In some exemplary embodiments the picker mechanisms used may be similar to the picker mechanism <b>86</b> used to separate sheets from a stack in the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the exemplary embodiment a vertically extending transport <b>246</b> is in operative connection with the picker mechanisms and a presenter mechanism <b>248</b>. In operation of the machine the presenter mechanism is operative to receive sheets dispensed by the picker mechanisms and to move the sheets upward through the transport <b>246</b> to accumulate the sheets into a stack schematically indicated <b>250</b>. After the desired sheets have been accumulated, the presenter mechanism is operative to move the stack toward the cash dispensing opening <b>38</b> while the controller is operative to open the cash dispensing gate <b>42</b>. This enables the stack of sheets to be dispensed to a user of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It should be understood that while in the exemplary embodiment the cash dispensing mechanism <b>220</b> has been described as dispensing various denominations of currency notes; in other embodiments the cash dispensing mechanism may dispense other types of sheets. These may include, for example, travelers' checks, stamps, vouchers, scrip, gift certificates, or other documents. Further, in some embodiments the ATM may be operative to dispense combinations of both notes and other documents as may be requested by the user. Of course the mechanisms shown are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In operation of the exemplary ATM <b>10</b>, a user operating the machine provides inputs sufficient to identify the user's account through the input devices of the machine. This may include, for example, providing a card and/or alpha-numeric data through the input devices which can be analyzed through operation of the controller in the machine and/or by interaction with a remote computer to determine a financial account of the user. The controller thereafter operates the output devices of the machine so as to prompt the user to provide inputs and to select a particular type of transaction or provide other inputs. In situations where the user wishes to conduct a cash accepting transaction, the ATM operates responsive to the controller <b>64</b> to open the gate <b>44</b> to the chute <b>82</b> which enables the user to provide a stack of notes or other documents into the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In response to the user providing the stack of documents <b>84</b> and/or in response to inputs from the user, the cash acceptor mechanism <b>80</b> operates to unstack the documents through operation of the picker mechanism <b>86</b> and to determine at least one of the characteristics of each document through operation of the validator device <b>88</b>. The determined characteristics of the documents may cause valid or acceptable documents to be routed through operation of the routing device <b>92</b> into the escrow device <b>94</b> where they may be temporarily stored. Also, the controller may operate the routing device <b>92</b> to direct suspect documents such as invalid documents or probable counterfeit notes to the transport <b>86</b> and the storage area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the exemplary embodiment once the documents have been moved past the validator, the controller may operate to advise the user of the machine's determination with regard to the documents through outputs through one or more output devices. In some exemplary embodiments the user may be offered the option to recover the valid or invalid documents or both. This may be accomplished by the escrow device delivering the documents to the same or different transports such that the documents may be returned to the chute or other area of the machine that is accessible to the user. Likewise if the option is offered, invalid documents may likewise be routed back to the user. Of course various approaches may be used depending on the particular machine configuration and the programming associated with the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the exemplary transaction, if the documents determined to be valid are to be stored within the machine, the controller operates responsive to inputs from the user and/or its programming to cause the escrow device <b>94</b> to deliver the documents. The documents are directed by the routing device <b>92</b> through the cash accepting opening <b>102</b> in the chest in which they are transported and stored in the appropriate sheet handling mechanisms or in an appropriate bulk storage container. In the exemplary embodiment the user's account is credited for valid sheets deposited. Information is collected concerning any invalid sheets provided by the user so that if the sheets are later determined to be valid, the user may be credited or alternatively the user may be contacted to determine the source of the invalid sheets. Of course as can be appreciated, this transaction is exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Using the exemplary ATM <b>10</b> a user may also conduct cash dispensing transactions. This may be done either during the same session as a cash accepting transaction or as part of a separate session. In such a transaction the user of the ATM provides inputs to the input devices that are sufficient to identify one or more accounts of the user and/or other identifying inputs. Responsive to prompts through the output devices, the user provides inputs indicating that they wish to conduct a transaction involving the dispense of notes or other types of sheets, and the amount, nature or character of the sheets that the user has requested.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Responsive to the inputs from the user the controller <b>64</b> is operative to cause the cash dispenser mechanism <b>220</b> and the picker mechanisms located therein to deliver the requested sheets to the presenter mechanism <b>248</b>, which is operative to accumulate the requested sheets into a stack <b>250</b>. Once the sheets are accumulated, the sheets are moved outward to the user as the gate mechanism is opened. Hereafter the controller operates to cause the value of the dispensed cash or other sheets to be charged to the user's account.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">It should be understood that the transactions described are exemplary and additional types of transactions may be carried out through operation of various embodiments. In addition as previously discussed, mechanisms that are operative to both accept and dispense cash such as those described in the incorporated disclosures may be utilized as substitutes for, or in addition to, the mechanisms described herein so as to carry out transactions. Other types of transaction function devices may be included in some embodiments. For example as previously discussed, embodiments of the invention may be operative to image and validate checks. In such cases it may be desirable for the machine to have the capability to cancel the check or destroy the check so there is no risk that the check may be later be stolen and used fraudulently. In some embodiments suitable mechanisms may be provided for carrying out such functions. In addition it may be desirable in some embodiments to have the machine produce bank checks, travelers' checks, tickets or other documents and suitable mechanisms may be provided for producing such documents in the selected amounts. Further, in alternative embodiments features used by merchants such as devices for accepting deposit bags, dispensing rolled coin and other devices may be incorporated into an ATM or other automated banking machine having features described herein. As can also be appreciated, features of the exemplary ATM may also be used in numerous other types of automated banking machines.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Exemplary embodiments of the invention include light emitting devices <b>17</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> and <b>45</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the light emitting devices are positioned in areas on the user interface at locations associated with particular transaction function devices. For example, light emitting device <b>31</b> is associated with the receipt printer <b>30</b> and light emitting device <b>17</b> is associated with the card reader <b>16</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the light emitting devices are in operative connection with the one or more controllers in the machine. In addition, such devices are capable of emitting light of selected colors at particular times during the transaction responsive to the operative condition of the transaction function device of the ATM with which the light emitting device is associated.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the exemplary embodiment the light emitting devices include an array of LEDs of different colors embedded on a flexible circuit. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> represents light emitting device <b>31</b>. However, it should be understood that in the exemplary embodiment all the light emitting devices are generally similar. Light emitting device <b>31</b> includes an array of LEDs <b>304</b> connected through a circuit on a flexible substrate such as a polymide film, for example, DuPont Kapton&#xae; material, and includes a flexible connector portion <b>306</b>. The flexible connector terminates in an electrical connector <b>308</b>. Electrical connector <b>308</b> is releasably connectible to a driving circuit or other electrical circuit in the machine which operably connects to one or more controllers for purposes of controlling the illumination of the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment the light emitting device includes three different color LEDs. These LEDs are red, green and yellow, which are represented by &#x201c;R,&#x201d; &#x201c;G,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Y&#x201d; in the figures as shown. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment the LEDs are in an array such that LEDs of only one color are vertically aligned along a single line of the light emitting device. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a line <b>310</b> comprises a line of vertically aligned red LEDs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a line <b>312</b> is a line of only green LEDs, and a line <b>314</b> of only yellow LEDs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment the lines repeat so that there are five vertical lines of each color LED. It should be understood that while in the exemplary embodiment the LEDs of each color are arranged in vertically aligned relation; in other embodiments other arrangements such as horizontal alignment or other matrices of LEDs may be used. It should also be appreciated that although the LEDs are connected electrically in series as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the electrical connections on the flexible circuit provide for spaced vertically aligned pairs of LEDs of only one color.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment the light emitting devices are supported in a flexible web. The web is thin in the preferred embodiment, having a thickness of approximately 1.20 millimeters. This facilitates the positioning of the light emitting devices on the user interface. In the exemplary embodiment, LEDs which are represented <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> are mounted on a base layer <b>320</b> including the circuit on a flexible substrate. An outer layer <b>322</b> which in the exemplary embodiment comprises a polyester layer overlies the LEDs. A spacer <b>324</b> extends between the base layer and the outer layer. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> multiple spacers may be used. In the exemplary embodiment the spacers are positioned outboard of the LEDs and include openings <b>326</b> to facilitate positioning the light emitting devices on the machine. This may include, for example, extending pins, studs, or fastening devices through the openings so as to secure the light emitting devices in the proper position. Further, in the exemplary embodiment the release layer includes an underlying adhesive layer <b>328</b>. The adhesive layer enables attaching of a light emitting device to a selected area within the machine. The adhesive layer is initially exposed for purposes of attaching the light emitting device by removal of an adhesive release layer <b>330</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an exemplary embodiment the light emitting devices are attached to components of the machine with which they are associated. This may be done, for example, by using modular construction for the transaction function devices within the machine and attaching the particular light emitting device to the associated module. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the cash accepting device <b>80</b> which is arranged as a modular device for purposes of processing sheets that may be received in the machine. In the exemplary embodiment the associated light emitting device <b>41</b> is mounted in supporting connection with the module. The adjacent fascia area of the machine provides an opening through which the light emitting device may be viewed when it is in the operative position. In some embodiments the fascia of the machine may include a transparent or translucent material separating the light emitting device from the exterior of the machine. However, in other embodiments the light emitting devices may be exposed on the exterior of the machine. The attachment of the light emitting devices directly to the modular components of the machine may facilitate assembly and service of the machine. Placing the light emitting device directly on the module of the transaction function device with which it is associated, may reduce the amount of wiring and connectors needed for purposes of assembly and service.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the exemplary embodiment the multicolor light emitting devices are operated under the control of one or more controllers in the machine. Each light emitting device is operated to emit light of a selected color and/or in a selected manner responsive to the operative condition of an associated transaction function device. For example, exemplary machines may be selectively programmable to emit a particular color light responsive to a given operative condition. For example, the light emitting device adjacent to the card reader may emit green light when it is ready to receive the card of a user, and then change to a yellow light after the card has been received therein. Alternatively or in addition, lights of a different color may flash or alternate to reflect conditions of a particular device. Further, for example, in the event of an improper action such as a user attempting to insert a card into the card reader incorrectly, the controller may be programmed to have the associated light emitting device emit red light or otherwise flash a color of light so as to indicate to the user that they have done something improper. Similarly, if a particular transaction function device is malfunctioning or not available, red light may be output.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some exemplary embodiments the controller may be programmed so as to illuminate the light emitting devices to guide a user in operation of the machine. This may include, for example, illuminating or flashing a particular colored light to indicate a required user activity at a particular location on the machine. For example, at a particular time in the transaction the controller may cause to be output on the display an indication to the customer that they are to take their receipt. When the machine has delivered the receipt, the controller may operate to cause the light emitting device <b>31</b> associated with the receipt delivery to illuminate, flash or otherwise indicate to the user that activity is required by the user in the area of the receipt delivery slot.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some exemplary embodiments the controller may be programmed to cause the light emitting devices to selectively illuminate intermittently and for a different duration depending on the operative condition of an associated device. For example, if a user provides inputs so as to request a cash-dispensing transaction, the light emitting device <b>43</b> adjacent to the cash dispensing opening may illuminate in a yellow condition as the machine operates internally to move bills toward the cash dispensing opening. Thereafter as the bills are pushed through the opening and presented to the user, the controller may cause the color of the light emitting device to change to green. In addition, the controller may cause the green light to flash so as to draw the user's attention to the fact that the money is ready to be taken. Further, in an exemplary embodiment, if the user has not taken their cash after a certain time and the machine is programmed to retract it, the controller may cause the light emitting device to flash or may operate so as to flash different colors in an alternating fashion so as to capture the attention of the user prior to the money being retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In other embodiments, the colors emitted by the light emitting devices may be selectively programmed based on aesthetic reasons. For example, if the entity which operates the machine has particular trade dress involving certain colors the controller may be programmed to have the light emitting devices correspond with that trade dress. Thus, for example, if the particular entity's trade dress color is green, the machine may be programmed to utilize the green LEDs as lead-through indicators in prompting the user in how to operate the machine. Likewise if a different operating entity with a similar machine utilizes yellow as part of their trade dress scheme, the controller may be programmed to illuminate the yellow LEDs in the light emitting devices as the lead-through indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">It should further be understood that although the use of three colors of light emitting devices is shown, this is exemplary and in other embodiments additional types of light emitting devices may be provided. In addition it should be understood that although light emitting devices in the exemplary embodiment are arranged so that only one color may be output from a given light emitting device at a given time, in other embodiments provision may be made to illuminate multiple color LEDs simultaneously. In such arrangements, LEDs in primary colors may be included so as to achieve ranges of hue through color combinations. This may be done by illuminating multiple light emitting sources simultaneously and/or varying the intensity of such sources through operation of a controller so as to achieve various colors. This may include, for example, providing for a gradual change in the hue of the light emitting device in accordance with the status of the associated transaction function device. This may include, for example, providing an indication to the user of the status of the completion of a particular task. Combinations of two or more colors may also be selectively produced. It should also be understood that although LEDs are used as the light source in the exemplary embodiment, in other embodiments of the invention other approaches may be used. It should be understood that the structures and operations described are exemplary and numerous other structures and methods may be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the exemplary embodiment of ATM <b>10</b>, provision is made to facilitate a user's operation of the machine and to minimize the risk of persons improperly observing a user or their activities. Such undesirable activities may include, for example, unauthorized persons observing the user's input of their PIN number or other data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, fascia <b>12</b> of the exemplary embodiment includes a recessed area <b>332</b> in which the display, function keys, card reader and receipt outlet are positioned. This recessed area <b>332</b> is illuminated by a light source <b>334</b>. Light source <b>334</b> provides illumination generally in the downward direction so as to enable the user to more readily view the locations of the input and output devices on the fascia of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the exemplary embodiment the fascia <b>12</b> includes a top panel portion <b>336</b> which is positioned generally above the light source <b>334</b> and the user interface of the machine. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the top panel portion includes a pair of convex mirrors <b>338</b>, <b>340</b>. The convex mirrors <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> are generally horizontally disposed and are positioned at opposed sides of the user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a user <b>342</b> operating the ATM <b>10</b> will generally have their body aligned with the user interface <b>15</b> of the machine. As a result, the user is generally enabled to view in the convex mirrors an area behind the user generally indicated <b>343</b>. The user is enabled to do this by looking in the mirrors <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> to the user's left and right, respectively. By looking in these mirrors, the user is enabled to generally see what is going on behind them as well as in a transverse direction from the area directly behind the user. This may enable the user to determine if one or more persons are in their proximity as well as whether such persons may be attempting to observe the user or their inputs to the ATM. In some embodiments where the ATM is operated in an external environment, lighting sources may be provided in the area <b>343</b> to facilitate the user's observation of persons who may be present therein.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">It should be understood that the arrangement shown is exemplary and in other embodiments other mirror or observation arrangements may be used. In addition, in some embodiments provision may be made to maintain the cleanliness of the mirrors so as to reduce the risk that the user's ability to observe surrounding activities is impaired. These provisions may include, for example, automated devices which wipe the surface of the mirrors periodically. These may be external wiping devices or in some embodiments internal wiping devices. This may be accomplished, for example, by having the convex mirrors be in supporting connection with one or more rotatable members that may be periodically rotated within the fascia by a motor or other moving device that operates responsive to the ATM controller so as to expose a new external surface. Cleaning devices on the interior of the fascia may operate to wipe contaminants from the surface of the mirror as it passes internally such that further rotation exposes a clean mirror surface to the user. This may include for example contact wiper blades that engage the surface of the mirror. Movement of the mirror surface such as rotation thereof in engagement with the wiper blades may serve to remove accumulations of dirt on the reflective surface. In some embodiments the mirror surface may be part of a cylindrical body, and rotation of the body about a central longitudinal axis may provide wiping action as the mirror surface moves past stationary wipers engaged therewith. In some embodiments the stationary wipers may be comprised of resilient material and/or may include movable mounting mechanisms so as to bias the wiper into engagement with the movable mirror surface. In alternative embodiments a reservoir of cleaning solution may be provided within or adjacent to the machine. A suitable pump or other device may be used to apply the cleaning solution to the mirror surface as it is moved relative to the wipers so as to facilitate the removal of dirt therefrom. Of course these approaches are merely exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments the buildup of material on the mirror surface may be detected to determine when there is a need for cleaning. This may be done for example by providing a mirror that has some significant light transmission properties as well as light reflective properties in the manner of a half-silvered mirror. For example a radiation source and sensor may be positioned behind the mirror. In such embodiments radiation emitted by the radiation source is partially reflected from the interior of the mirror surface and the magnitude of the reflected radiation is sensed by the sensor. A buildup of dirt on the outer surface of the mirror changes the amount of radiation reflected from the internal radiation source to the sensor. In some exemplary embodiments the buildup of dirt on the exterior mirror surface increases the magnitude of radiation reflected from the internal mirror surface. This change in the magnitude of reflected radiation is detected and used as the basis for determining a need for cleaning the mirror. For example immediately after cleaning the mirror the ATM controller or other processor may cause the emitter to output radiation and the sensor to sense the magnitude of internally reflected radiation from an internal surface of the mirror. This initial value is stored by the controller in one or more data stores. Thereafter on a periodic basis, for example on a timed basis or after each or a set number of transactions, the emitter may again output radiation and the level of reflected radiation sensed. The controller may then compare the then current level of reflected radiation to the initial value.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In response to sensing a difference greater than the set amount, which difference corresponds to an unacceptable level of dirt built up on an exterior surface of the mirror, the controller operates to provide one or more signals. The signals result in the mirrors being cleaned. Such signals may include for example operating a device such as a motor or other mechanism so as to cause movement of the mirror to undergo cleaning. Alternatively in some embodiments the controller may cause a message to be sent to a remote servicer indicating a need for cleaning of the mirror surfaces on the fascia. In still other embodiments the controller may cause the ATM to operate to try to clean the mirrors through the ATM's internal cleaning mechanism and then test the reflectance again after the attempted self cleaning. If the self cleaning effort does not cause the reflectance value to reach the prior initial value or within a programmed range (indicating perhaps that the mirror has been spray painted) the controller is operative to cause a message to be set to contact a remote servicer. Of course these approaches are merely exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some other alterative embodiments the controller may sense for dirt on a mirror through the use of mirrors or other reflective devices that pass at least some significant amount of light therethrough from the exterior to the interior. One or more light sensors in operative connection with the machine controller are positioned behind the mirror surface. An external light sensor is positioned on the exterior of the ATM to sense the level of ambient light. A controller is programmed to determine an unacceptable level of accumulation of dirt on the mirror based on the level of external ambient light that is sensed as passing through the mirror. This may be done for example by sensing the magnitude of the signal from the ambient light sensor and comparing the magnitude of ambient light to the magnitude of light sensed as reaching the sensor located behind the mirror. As can be appreciated when little or no dirt is accumulated on the mirror surface, the greatest amount of light will reach the sensor behind the mirror. As dirt accumulates, the level of light transmitted will decrease. If the magnitude of the light sensed as passing through the mirror and reaching the sensor relative to the level of ambient light declines to a preset ratio or other value, the controller may then operate in accordance with its programmed instructions to operate the necessary device to self clean the mirror, generate signals so as to contact a servicer, or take other appropriate action.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In further alternative embodiments one or more external ambient light sensors may be in operative connection with the controller, and an internal emitter and sensor behind a mirror surface that enables light to pass therethrough may also be used. In such embodiments the controller may be programmed to analyze the amount of ambient light that is expected to pass through the mirror and reach the sensor based on the ambient light level. In such circumstances the controller can compensate for the ambient light when sensing the level of reflected light from the internal emitter. Such compensation may further help more accurately detect when there is a need for the mirror to be cleaned. Of course the particular relationships and compensation levels will depend on the particular mirror configuration. Alternatively or in addition in some exemplary embodiments, the controller may operate so as to sense the level of ambient radiation and the magnitude thereof that passes through the mirror to reach the sensor at a different time than when the controller operates the internal emitter and senses reflected radiation. The controller may be operative to compare these two separate values and the relationship thereof and/or changes in reflectance and light transmissivity over time so as to determine when the mirror needs to be cleaned. Of course these approaches are merely exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In still other embodiments the mirrors may be operative only during transactions or portions thereof. This may be done for example by providing mirrors that are operative only when a person is sensed as adjacent the machine or the machine is involved in conducting a particular portion of a transaction. For example a sensor such as a sonic sensor, radiation sensor, weight sensor or other suitable device may detect a user in proximity to the machine. Upon sensing the user adjacent the machine the controller may be operative to cause one or more mirrors to be exposed externally on the fascia of the machine. This may be done for example by having movable members in supporting connection with the mirror surfaces driven by motors or other suitable moving devices that are in operative connection with the controllers. Upon sensing a user adjacent the machine the controller is operative to cause the motors or other moving devices to cause the mirrors to move into an operative position so a user can view the area behind them.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example in some embodiments the reflective surfaces which comprise the mirror may be in supporting connection with a rotatable member. The rotatable member may be rotated when the customer is present at the machine so that the reflective surface is positioned so as to provide the user with a view of the area behind them. Further, when the customer is sensed as leaving the area of the ATM, such departure of the user is sensed and the controller in response thereto is operative to cause the members that include the reflected surfaces to move so that the reflector surfaces are no longer exposed. Such an approach may provide an advantage in that the mirror surfaces are exposed to the elements only during the times when transactions are occurring and therefore are less likely to accumulate dirt as quickly. In addition, in some embodiments wipers or other suitable cleaning devices may be provided adjacent to the reflective surfaces so that as the reflective surfaces move the surfaces are wiped and cleaned so as to remain relatively dirt free.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although in some embodiments the reflective surfaces may move into the operative position for a customer responsive to sensing a user adjacent to the machine, in other embodiments other approaches may be used. These may include for example moving the mirror surfaces to the operative position only in response to certain actions or certain transaction types being conducted by the user at the machine. Alternatively or in addition the mirrors may be moved to the operative position only in response to other conditions such as ambient lighting conditions, the time of day and/or the sensing of persons or objects entering an area behind the user in which persons or objects are sensed. Alternatively or in addition the controller may be programmed and appropriate sensors may be provided to move the mirrors to the operative position based on the nature of the use being made by the user of the ATM. For example in an ATM that is intended for both drive up and walk up use, appropriate sensors may be positioned so as to sense whether the user is positioned in a vehicle or has approached the machine on foot. This may be done for example through proximity sensors, magnetic sensors, weight sensors or other suitable sensors. The controller may be programmed to make a determination based on one or more sensor inputs whether the user is in a vehicle or is on foot. In situations where the user is determined to be in a vehicle the deployment of the mirrors to the operative position may be deemed unnecessary because the vehicle may serve to block access by unauthorized users to viewing the inputs that the user makes to the machine. Alternatively if the user is determined to have approached the machine on foot, the controller may be operative to deploy the mirrors to the operative position so as to assure that the user can view the area behind them in which unauthorized persons may be attempting to view inputs to the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In still other embodiments, alternative or additional provisions may be made to further help to prevent the observation of inputs by users to the machine. For example in some embodiments the machine fascia may be provided with lighting that is directed rearward from the fascia outside of the line of sight of the user. Such rearward directed lighting, when activated, may operate to obscure the view of unauthorized persons or devices attempting to observe inputs by the user to a machine. Such rearward directed lighting may be selectively operative when a user is sensed as adjacent to the machine so as to reduce the risk of the interception of the user inputs and/or to provide lighting in the area behind the user. In other embodiments the controller may be programmed so as to be operative to initiate the rearward directed lighting only during certain portions of the transaction where the user is conducting certain activities. For example the controller may be programmed so as to activate the lighting when the user is providing an input of a PIN number which unauthorized persons may wish to intercept. Further in some embodiments the rearward directed lighting may be activated only at those times that the mirrors are moved into the activated position. Alternatively or in addition the lighting devices may be mounted in supporting connection with the mechanisms associated with the mirror structures. Further provision may be made in some cases so as to provide mechanisms for cleaning the lighting devices as they are moved into the operative position. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used. Further, the principles discussed may be used with other types of automated banking machines and in other circumstances other than those described in connection with the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-31</figref> are directed to yet other exemplary embodiments to further help to prevent the observation of inputs by users to the machine by unauthorized persons. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> a user input device which in the exemplary embodiment comprises a keypad <b>18</b> comprising a plurality of manually actuatable keys, may be covered by a concealment device generally denoted <b>350</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the concealment device <b>350</b> may include a body which is alternatively referred to as a casing <b>354</b>, including top cover <b>358</b>, first and second side walls <b>360</b>, <b>362</b>, respectively, and back wall <b>366</b> which bound an interior area. In the exemplary embodiment the cover, and walls are comprised of non-transparent material. Elements of the exemplary casing <b>354</b> extend in generally surrounding relation of the keypad and in this embodiment cooperate to form a viewing portal <b>370</b>. A viewing portal comprises a visual opening or area in which a user can indirectly view the input device and the actuation thereof by the user such as by a user's fingers which are alternatively referred to as digits. In the exemplary embodiment shown, viewing portal <b>370</b> is formed by a gap between the top cover <b>358</b> and back wall <b>366</b>, although various other approaches may be used. For example, the top cover <b>358</b> may abut back wall <b>366</b> and viewing portal <b>370</b> may be a cut out in the top cover <b>358</b>. Viewing portal <b>370</b> may alternatively be an open slot, or it may be one or more areas comprised of transparent material. Alternatively, the viewing portal may comprise other combinations of devices which enable indirect viewing of the input device and the activation thereof by a user's digits and may include for example a camera or other image device in the casing, and a display positioned in a location for viewing only by the machine user. In some embodiments the display may be the display of the ATM, such as display <b>24</b>. Alternatively the viewing portal may comprise one or more displays supported on the casing <b>354</b>, the ATM fascia <b>12</b> or other location that limits viewing of the input device and the inputs being made only to a person having the point of view of the machine user and prevents viewing by others. For purposes of this disclosure any structure or devices which enable a banking machine user to observe the input device and the operation thereof shall be referred to as a viewing portal.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The elements of exemplary casing <b>354</b> cooperate to define an interior area <b>374</b>. The user input device or keypad <b>18</b> may be accessible to a user through hand entry slot <b>376</b> alternatively referred to herein as an opening, which is bounded by the casing. The user in this embodiment is enabled to extend one or several fingers and a portion of their hand in the slot to actuate selectively each of the purality of keys of the keypad.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, exemplary concealment device <b>350</b> includes an indirect viewing mechanism generally denoted <b>378</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the indirect viewing mechanism <b>378</b> includes reflecting surfaces within the interior area. A first mirror <b>380</b> is disposed on an interior surface of the top cover <b>358</b>. A second mirror <b>382</b> is positioned on an interior surface of back wall <b>366</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, first mirror <b>380</b> is operable to reflect an image of user input device; in this example keypad <b>18</b> and a user's digits adjacent the keys toward the back wall <b>366</b>. Second mirror <b>382</b> is operable to reflect that image so that it can be viewed through the viewing portal <b>370</b>. The viewing portal <b>370</b> is arranged to allow a user to view the reflected image from a viewing position in the user's point of view which is schematically shown along line of sight <b>386</b>. Thus indirect viewing mechanism <b>378</b> utilizes the properties of reflected light in order to allow a user to indirectly view inputs as they are being made by the user's fingers to keypad <b>18</b>. The double reflection of the image of the keypad <b>18</b> of this exemplary embodiment presents an image in correct orientation to the user. Of course this indirect viewing mechanism is exemplary and in other embodiments other mechanisms for indirect viewing such as cameras, light guides or other devices may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The arrangement of the exemplary concealment device and user's required body position necessary to extend a hand through the opening to actuate the keypad is generally effective to block viewing of the user inputs by other persons in a position directly behind the user and the casing <b>354</b> operates to cut down on sight lines from the top and sides. In this exemplary embodiment, input device <b>18</b> cannot be readily viewed by a person other than the user, thus enhancing the security of any input made.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A user may thus use the automated banking machine with greater confidence that various inputs, including a PIN, may not be readily viewed by another. Also, the exemplary embodiments of the concealment device <b>350</b> prevent unauthorized devices that may be positioned to view the ATM fascia such as cameras, from viewing the input of the user's PIN.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In yet another exemplary embodiment, the casing <b>354</b> is selectively positionable with respect to the user input device <b>18</b> between a covered position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, and an uncovered position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The casing <b>354</b> or a portion thereof may be mounted in supporting connection with the fascia <b>12</b> via one or more hinges <b>390</b> or other support structures which enable movement thereof. In this exemplary embodiment, hinge <b>390</b> extends between first side wall <b>360</b> and fascia <b>12</b> to allow selective positioning of casing <b>354</b>. Thus, in this embodiment if a user believes that the added security of the concealment device is unnecessary under the circumstances, the casing <b>354</b> can be moved from its covered position to an uncovered position to allow direct viewing of the keypad <b>18</b> by the user. This approach also facilitates access to the interior area of the development device and/or the keypad for purposes such as inspection and cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In alternative embodiments the device may include a movable cover for securely providing access to the input device. For example the top cover <b>358</b> may be mounted in movable supporting connection with the casing. The top cover may be movable to an open position such that the input device becomes more accessible when the cover is moved from a closed position to an open position. In some embodiments based on the mounting, the area size of the opening may be increased as the movable cover is moved from the closed position to the open position. In some embodiments an ATM user may be able to open and close the cover or other enclosure as they deem fit. In alternative embodiments the casing may be held closed by a lock or other latching mechanism. The lock or latching mechanism may be opened by a servicer or other authorized person or alternatively, electronically through operation of the banking machine for servicing such as cleaning or other maintenance functions. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In yet another exemplary embodiment, the concealment device <b>350</b> may include a lighting mechanism such as light <b>394</b>, operable to illuminate interior area <b>374</b>. The illustrated positioning of the lighting mechanism is merely exemplary and in other embodiments, other approaches may be used. For example, the lighting mechanism may be incorporated into the keypad <b>18</b>, or may be mounted on the interior of the top cover <b>358</b>. For example, the keypad may include a backlighting mechanism such that the keys are illuminated. Such an illumination mechanism may be combined with a mechanism that detects unauthorized devices that are intended to intercept a user's inputs. Such a system is shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/832,960 filed Apr. 27, 2004 which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein. Alternatively or in addition, embodiments may include backlighting of the input device and lighting of the interior area from a direction other than that of the face of the input device. Such apparatus may help in viewing the user's fingers in actuating the keys of the keypad. In some alternative embodiments lights of different colors may be used to further aid in viewing the input device and the user's fingers. For example in some embodiments the keypad may be backlit in one color while a light of a different color within the casing primarily illuminates the user's fingers. This may make it easier to view the user's fingers in relation to the keys of the keypad. In other embodiments one or more sensors, such as a photoelectric sensor may be positioned to sense the presence of a user's fingers in the interior area. At least one circuit including a processor in operative connection with the sensor and illumination device may operate to cause the illumination device to turn on whenever a user's digits are sensed within or adjacent the concealment device. Of course these approaches are exemplary of many that may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In other embodiments at least one processor in the banking machine may be programmed to cause the sending of at least one signal when the banking machine is ready to receive inputs through the keypad or other type of input device which has viewing thereof controlled through use of a concealment device. In response to such signals the illumination device in the interior area of the concealment device is operative to illuminate at times when the banking machine is ready or otherwise enabled to accept inputs through the input device. Of course alternative approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In still other embodiments provisions may be made to facilitate viewing within the interior area of a concealment device. For example in some embodiments, particularly those designed for use in an outdoor environment, moisture may tend to condense or other contaminants may accumulate within the interior area of the casing. In some embodiments devices for minimizing condensation may be provided. Such devices may include for example, an air movement device such as a fan schematically indicated <b>396</b>. The fan may be operative responsive to a processor or controller in the ATM or other device to cause air movement in the interior area and minimize condensation of moisture. In other embodiments arc movement may be operative to provide positive pressure in the interior area to minimize the introduction of dust and dirt into the interior area. And in some embodiments a heater <b>398</b> may be provided to heat air within the casing. The heater may be operative responsive to the controller in the ATM or other controller, to heat the air within the casing so as to reduce the risk of condensation.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments sensors may be provided in or adjacent to the casing to detect environmental conditions that likely result in condensation. These may include temperature and/or humidity sensors that are used to sense conditions that result in condensation. In response to such conditions the at least one processor in the machine may operate in accordance with its programming to cause the heater and/or the fan to operate. Alternatively or in addition, sensor systems of the type previously discussed in connection with the detection of the need to clean the mirrors <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> may be used in connection with the reflective surfaces within the casing. For example, such approaches may be used for detecting condensation on the surfaces and may cause a controller to turn on and off the fan and/or heater as appropriate. Alternatively or in addition, signals from temperature and/or humidity sensors may also be used in the programs executed by the controller in deciding what actions to take. Alternatively in some embodiments, provision may be made for signaling the need for cleaning the reflective surfaces in a manner similar to that discussed in connection with the mirrors <b>338</b> and <b>340</b>. Further in some embodiments the illumination device within the housing may be operated to facilitate the detecting of conditions through radiation or other appropriate sensors. Alternatively or in addition, provisions may be made in some embodiments for providing for automated cleaning of the mirror surfaces or illumination devices. It should further be understood that although the fan and heater are schematically shown in the casing, in some embodiments such devices may be positioned within the housing of the ATM and suitable fluid conduits provided to achieve air flow and/or heating within the interior area of the casing. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments sensors may be provided to detect the presence of and/or attempts to install unauthorized input interception devices. These may include for example, sensors that sense radiation properties within the interior area of the casing so as to detect installation of an unauthorized device for detecting the pressing of keys. Alternatively devices for imparting vibration to the fascia and/or casing and sensing changes in vibration properties may be used to detect a change in properties which may be indicative of the presence of an unauthorized device. Alternatively or in addition, sensors which detect changes in levels or fluctuations in radiation within radio frequencies may be installed to detect the installation of a radio transmitter associated with an unauthorized input interception device. Approaches described may also be of the type disclosed in the incorporated disclosure of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/832,960. Controllers and/or processors in operative connection with such sensors which detect unauthorized input interception devices may be operative to generate signals which are operative to notify a remote entity, modify operation of the ATM, initiate countermeasures to prevent input interception, invalidate user cards and/or cause the ATM to cease operation. Of course these approaches are exemplary and in other embodiments other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In alternative embodiments other approaches may be used to minimize interception of inputs by unauthorized persons. For example in some embodiments the reflective surfaces may be configured such that a user's eyes must be positioned in a particular location to readily observe the keypad and fingers. As a result, an unauthorized person or device attempting to observe user inputs in a position that is remote or even relatively close to a user's position cannot actually observe the inputs. This might be done for example by using contoured mirror surfaces that enable a clear image only from a point of view in a particular location which is the viewpoint in an appropriate position of a person operating the banking machine from the user interface. In alternative embodiments the reflective surfaces and/or the casing may be made to be movable by the user. This could be done through a movable mounting of the casing in supporting connection with the fascia of the ATM such that the user can precisely position the spot at which the inputs may be readily observed. In some alternative embodiments the keypad or other input device may also be made movable such that the user can precisely position the portal for viewing. Such approaches may also make the ATM more readily suitable for use by both left and right hand users as well as persons of varying heights. Of course, these approaches are exemplary of many that may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Of course as previously discussed, some embodiments may have an imaging device in the casing and may provide outputs for viewing on one or more displays. In some embodiments provision may be made to enable a user through hand and/or finger movements to adjust the position of one or more display screens or the position of the output image within a field of view such as on the ATM display of the banking machine user interface. For example, a display screen may be positioned on the casing or other concealment device structure, and may be movable with or relative to the casing to a desired position by the user to minimize the risk of input observation. Alternatively if an output though the ATM display is used, the user may position a frame showing the user's fingers and input device selectively on the display in a way that assures it is blocked from viewing by others. This may be done for example by the user positioning the output in a lower portion of the display where the display output area is effectively blocked by being viewed by anyone other than the ATM user by the user's body.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some embodiments the display screen may be operative only during selected time periods during transactions when inputs to the input device are possible or required. For example, an image of the keypad and the user's fingers may appear only in a portion of the ATM display when the machine is ready to receive input a personal identification number (PIN). At other times the image of the input device may not be presented. Alternatively one or more sensors may sense the introduction of the user's fingers into the interior area of the casing and cause a controller in the ATM to provide screen outputs. This may be appropriate for example in situations where a user enters various inputs such as a PIN, amounts or other instructions at various times during various transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, in some embodiments an ATM controller may be programmed to sense that a user is using voice guidance features for operating the ATM. This might be done for operation of the ATM by a visually impaired person. In such circumstances the ATM may sense that a user has connected headphones to a headphone jack on the ATM to receive audio instructions. In such embodiments the controller may operate to shut off or restrict viewing through the viewing device. This may include not having the image of the input device appear on the ATM display or other screen. Alternatively in other embodiments the controller may not actuate the lights that enable viewing the input device in the casing. Of course difference approaches may be used depending on the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It should be understood that while the exemplary embodiment is discussed as being in connection with an ATM keypad, other embodiments may be used with other types of banking machine input devices.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Thus the automated banking machine and system of the exemplary embodiments may achieve one or more of the above stated objectives, eliminate difficulties encountered in the use of prior devices and systems, solve problems and attain the desirable results described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the foregoing description certain terms have been used for brevity, clarity and understanding, however no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom because such terms are for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Moreover, the descriptions and illustrations herein are by way of examples and the invention is not limited to the details shown and described.</p>
