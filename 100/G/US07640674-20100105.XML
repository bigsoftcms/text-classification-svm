<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An articulated arm portable coordinate measurement machine (PCMM) can be calibrated or recalibrated using a coordinate measurement machine (CMM). In one method for PCMM calibration, the CMM can be moved to one position, and the PCMM moved to a contact position where a probe head of the PCMM contacts a probe head of the PCMM. The PCMM and the CMM can be operatively coupled, for example, by a synchronizing cable such that position data from the PCMM and the CMM can be obtained at the contact position. The PCMM can be repositioned one or more times to obtain position data at multiple PCMM positions. The CMM can be repositioned as desired and additional contact position data sets obtained by subsequent positioning and repositioning of the PCMM. Various probe head types such as touch trigger probes, hard probes, and contact probes can be used in the calibration systems and methods.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to measurement machines, more specifically to articulated arm portable coordinate measurement machines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable coordinate measurement machines (PCMMs) such as articulated arm PCMMs can be used to perform a variety of measurement and coordinate acquisition tasks. In one common commercially-available PCMM, an articulated arm having three transfer members connected by articulating joints allows easy movement of a probe head about seven axes to take various measurements. For optimal precision and accuracy of the measurements generated by a PCMM, it must initially be calibrated to account for any manufacturing variations in the components of the PCMM itself.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previously, a portable coordinate measurement machine would be calibrated by using the PCMM to measure one or more length artifacts such as bars of precisely known dimensions. By using a PCMM to measure lengths of a length artifact having precisely known dimensions, position data obtained by the PCMM could be analyzed, and a PCMM processor and or position measuring device such as an analog or digital encoder calibrated to reflect the known measurements of the length artifact.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the previous calibration process typically resulted in acceptable calibration results, it did have shortcomings. The prior PCMM calibration process can be expensive as the precision-manufactured length artifacts are difficult and costly to produce. This previous calibration process was also time consuming as the PCMM would need to be manually manipulated between various positions with respect to the length artifacts. The prior PCMM calibration process was also somewhat limited as only a relatively small number of position readings were typically taken. Also this process can be subject to some variation as even the precision-manufactured length artifacts are subject to some degree of length variation due to thermal expansion.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described in further detail herein, systems and methods are disclosed overcoming the shortcomings of the prior art and having certain advantages. In light of the prior methods discussed above, there is a need for a relatively fast, reliable, inexpensive method of calibrating a PCMM.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a method for calibrating a portable coordinate measurement machine having a probe is provided. The method comprises providing a coordinate measurement machine, positioning the coordinate measurement machine in a first calibration position; positioning the portable coordinate measurement machine in a first position; positioning the coordinate measurement machine in a second calibration position; and positioning the portable coordinate measurement machine in a second position. The coordinate measurement machine has a measurement probe. With the portable coordinate measurement machine in the first position, the probe contacts the measurement probe of the coordinate measurement machine in the first calibration position. With the portable coordinate measurement machine in the second position, the probe contacts the measurement probe of the coordinate measurement machine in the second calibration position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other embodiments, a system for calibrating a portable coordinate measurement machine is provided. The system comprises a coordinate measurement machine, a portable coordinate measurement machine, and a control unit operatively coupled to the coordinate measurement machine and the portable coordinate measurement machine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other embodiments, a contact probe for a coordinate measurement machine is provided. The contact probe comprises a plate, a first spherical portion extending from the plate, a second spherical portion extending from the plate, and a third spherical portion extending from the plate. The first, second, and third spherical portions are positioned to form a seat on the plate. The first, second, and third spherical portions are electrically coupled to one another such that simultaneous contact of the first, second, and third spherical portions completes a segment of an electrical circuit.</p>

In other embodiments, the order and orientation of the axes may vary, for example, in some embodiments the support may travel vertically and the sleeve horizontally. The CMM may also have a rotary axis that the portable CMM rotates about</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the CMM <b>10</b> can be operatively coupled to a processor <b>70</b> that can include a CMM controller configured to actuate the CMM to a desired position in a three-dimensional space reference frame. The position of the CMM in each axis can be determined by measuring transducers such as linear encoder, which may be of the type optical, magnetic, laser, or any other type of transducer which can provide absolute or relative position. The processor <b>70</b> can also be configured to determine a position of the probe tip within three dimensional space. For example, the position of the probe tip <b>20</b> can be measured with respect to an (x,y,z) coordinate system where x, y, and z represent orthogonal axes defining a three-dimensional space. As is known in the art, the position of each of the portal <b>14</b>, the support <b>16</b>, the sleeve <b>18</b> using a dedicated transducer. Each transducer can output a signal (e.g., an electrical signal), which can vary according to the movement of the corresponding member (i.e., the portal <b>14</b>, the support <b>16</b>, the sleeve <b>18</b>). The signal can be carried through wires or otherwise transmitted to the processor <b>70</b>. From there, the signal can be processed and/or transferred to a computer for determining the position of the probe tip <b>20</b> in space. Thus, the probe tip <b>20</b> of a CMM can be used to perform various measuring operations.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Method for Calibrating a PCMM Using a CMM</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> various embodiments of method for calibrating a PCMM are illustrated. In general, the CMM <b>10</b> can be positioned at one or more positions while the PCMM can be positioned such that the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>40</b> contacts the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, for each position of the CMM <b>10</b>, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be repositioned in multiple contact positions. For each contact position, position data from the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> can be obtained by the processor <b>70</b>. With sufficient data collection, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be calibrated such that it accurately provides position data correlating to that generated by the CMM <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first contact position between the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> is illustrated. In the illustrated contact position, the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b> can be positioned at a first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) and the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>40</b> can moved into a first position such that it contacts the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM. Contact between the two probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> can trigger a synchronization signal to be sent over the sync cable <b>30</b> such that position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> and the CMM <b>10</b> is captured by the processor <b>70</b>. That is, when the synchronization signal is sent, both the PCMM <b>40</b> and the CMM <b>10</b> at substantially the same time record the position of their respective probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> by recording the position of the individual transducers and sending such data to the processor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second contact position between the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> is illustrated. With the CMM <b>10</b> remaining in the first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>), the PCMM <b>40</b> can then be moved to a second position such that the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>56</b> contacts the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b>. Desirably, at least one of the probe heads <b>56</b>, <b>20</b> is configured to allow contact at multiple orientations, for example, one or both of the probe heads <b>56</b>, <b>20</b> can include a substantially spherical contact section such that the probe head <b>56</b>, <b>20</b> can contact a surface to be measured at various orientations. Accordingly, the PCMM can be positioned with the transfer members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> at different orientations in the second contact position than in the first contact position, thus allowing calibration of the transducers, such as analog or digital encoders, in each of the articulating joints <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Again, contact between the two probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> can trigger a synchronization signal to be sent over the sync cable <b>30</b> such that position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> and the CMM <b>10</b> is captured by the processor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a third contact position between the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> is illustrated. With the CMM <b>10</b> remaining in the first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>), the PCMM <b>40</b> can then be moved to a third position such that the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>56</b> contacts the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b>. Desirably, the orientations of the transfer members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the PCMM <b>10</b> is different in the third contact position than it is in the first or second contact positions. As noted above, desirably, one or both of the contact probes can include spherical surfaces allowing the probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> to contact one another at multiple orientations. Again, contact between the two probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> can trigger a synchronization signal to be sent over the sync cable <b>30</b> such that position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> and the CMM <b>10</b> is captured by the processor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, with the CMM <b>10</b> in a first contact position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>), the PCMM <b>40</b> is positioned into three distinct contact positions, and position data is collected regarding each of these contact positions. In other embodiments of this method, more or fewer than three contact positions can be made for each position of the CMM <b>10</b>, depending on the amount of position data it is desired to generate. For example, in some embodiments, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be placed in a single contact position for each position of the CMM <b>10</b>, while in other embodiments, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be repositioned into four, five, or more than five different contact positions for each position of the CMM <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, it can be desirable to reposition the PCMM <b>40</b> in at least 8 contact positions while the CMM <b>10</b> is in the first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>), thus resulting in a constellation of position data points which can be used to calibrate the PCMM <b>40</b>. Each data point in turn includes the data for each of the transducers in both of the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b>. With more position data from multiple contact points to process, it can be possible to calibrate the PCMM <b>40</b> more accurately. However, it can take additional time to reposition the PCMM <b>40</b> in multiple positions to obtain additional position data. Therefore, in some embodiments, a balance can be reached between a desire for the additional accuracy obtained from additional positioning and the additional time required to position the PCMM <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> illustrate additional contact positions of the CMM <b>10</b> and PCMM <b>40</b>.

In some embodiments, the CMM <b>10</b> can be moved with respect to only one or two axis such that one or two of x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, or z<sub>2 </sub>can equal the corresponding axial component from the first position x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, and z<sub>1</sub>. In other embodiments, the CMM <b>10</b> can be moved in all three axes when moved from the first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) to the second position (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>) such that each of x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, and z<sub>2 </sub>is different from the corresponding axial component x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, and z<sub>1 </sub>in the first position.</p>

Contact between the two probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> can trigger a synchronization signal to be sent over the sync cable <b>30</b> such that position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> and the CMM <b>10</b> is captured by the processor <b>70</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, it can be desirable to reposition the PCMM <b>40</b> in at least 8 contact positions while the CMM <b>10</b> is in the second position (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>), thus resulting in a constellation of position data points which can be used to calibrate the PCMM <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a method of calibrating a PCMM <b>40</b> using a CMM <b>10</b> is illustrated including two positions of the CMM <b>10</b> and three positions of the PCMM <b>40</b> for each position of the CMM <b>10</b>. Thus, the illustrated embodiment generates six data sets, each data set including position data of the CMM <b>10</b> and corresponding position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> at each of the contact positions. These data sets can be used to calibrate the PCMM <b>40</b> such that it can accurately be used to measure coordinates within a desired tolerance range. It is contemplated that the method described herein can be scaled to generate more or fewer data sets as may be desired to achieve a relatively small tolerance for subsequent measurements taken by the PCMM <b>40</b>. For example, in some embodiments, it can be desirable to position and reposition the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> to generate at least 50 contact positions corresponding to 50 data sets. In other embodiments, it can be desirable to generate between 25 and 50 contact positions corresponding to 20-50 data sets.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Advantageously, the calibration method described herein can be used to generate a relatively high number of data sets. This high number of data sets can lead to greater accuracy in calibrating the PCMM. In the prior art methods in which length artifacts are used to generate a number of sets of position data, the number of data points to be obtained can be fairly limited. In contrast, in the method described herein, as the CMM <b>10</b> moves form the first position to the second position, the calibration method can use in addition to the distance between the first and second position also use the location of these points in space as measured by the CMM <b>10</b>. With this additional data, the calibration method can require fewer measurements to achieve the same level of accuracy and reliability. In this manner, the time used to calibrate the PCMM <b>40</b> can be decreased and/or the accuracy or reliability of the calibration can increase for the same or similar amount of data points.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, in a conventional method using the length artifacts to calibrate a PCMM, the total number of lengths which may be measured by the PCMM can be determined by the formula:</p>

As used in the prior art calibration methods for a PCMM <b>40</b>, length artifacts are typically metal rods manufactured with tight tolerances to have precise dimensions. As noted above, in prior art methods, length artifacts, including metal rods of a predetermined length having spherical ends, can be used to calibrate a PCMM. Conventional artifacts for calibration and/or certification can include ball bars, step gauges, bars with comical seats, and gauge blocks. The precision of the dimensions required to be used for calibration of a PCMM, however, can make these length artifacts very expensive and difficult to manufacture. Additionally, even with precision manufacturing, the length artifacts can be subject to some variation in length due to thermal expansion depending on ambient conditions. However, when length artifacts are used as a validation of a calibration of a PCMM <b>40</b> by a CMM <b>10</b>, their dimensions need not be precisely manufactured. Likewise, length variations due to thermal expansion are not likely to introduce error into the calibration. Thus, length artifacts for validating a calibration method need not be as expensive or difficult to manufacture as those used in prior art methods of PCMM calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B, in some embodiments of a method of PCMM calibration, validation with a length artifact can include positioning a length artifact <b>64</b> on the worktable <b>12</b> of the CMM <b>10</b>, positioning the probe tip <b>20</b> CMM <b>10</b> at one end of the length artifact (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), obtaining position data from the CMM <b>10</b>, positioning the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b> at the opposite end of the length artifact <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), and obtaining position data from the CMM <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of validation, the probe tip <b>20</b> of the CMM <b>10</b> can then be positioned away from the length artifact <b>64</b>. The PCMM <b>40</b> can then be positioned such that the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>40</b> contacts one end of the length artifact <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), and position data of the PCMM obtained. The PCMM <b>40</b> can then be repositioned such that the probe head <b>56</b> of the PCMM <b>40</b> contacts the opposite end of the length artifact <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), and position data of the PCMM <b>40</b> obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the validation sequence has been performed as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B, position data of the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> can then be compared. In some embodiments of calibration method, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be positioned in more than one contact positions with each end of the length artifact <b>64</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>70</b> can be configured to quantify an error between the positions of the CMM <b>10</b> position and the PCMM <b>40</b> position. If an error identified between the positions of the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> is greater than a predetermined error threshold, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be recalibrated by the CMM <b>10</b> according to the method described herein. If the error identified by the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b> is within a predetermined error threshold, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be considered calibrated.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Probe Head Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>10</b>A, <b>11</b>A, and <b>12</b>A, in various embodiments, different configurations of probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> can be used in the PCMM <b>40</b> calibration method described herein. Several possible configurations of probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> are illustrated, although it is contemplated that other, non-illustrated configurations can be used. As noted above, it can be desirable that at least one of the probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> include a profile, such as a spherical profile or a segment of a spherical profile, which allows the probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> to contact one another in multiple orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, in some embodiments, the probe tip <b>20</b> on the CMM <b>10</b> can comprise a touch trigger probe <b>82</b>, and the probe head <b>56</b> on the PCMM <b>40</b> can comprise a hard probe <b>84</b>. The touch trigger probe <b>82</b> can include an electric switch configured to signal the processor <b>70</b> when contact has been made, as further discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. The hard probe <b>84</b> can be electrically passive. The hard probe <b>84</b> can include probe surface defined by a substantially spherical ball. Accordingly, the PCMM <b>40</b> can be repositioned into many orientations with respect to the CMM <b>10</b> which define contact positions as the touch trigger probe can contact different areas of the spherical ball in various contact positions. Various touch trigger probes and hard probes are readily available for use with PCMMs and CMMs and can be used in the PCMM calibration methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As discussed above, when a contact position between the probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> is achieved, it is desirable to simultaneously obtain position data from both the CMM <b>10</b> and the PCMM <b>40</b>. The CMM <b>10</b> and PCMM <b>40</b> can be operatively coupled to achieve the desired synchronization of position data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates a possible connection between the CMM <b>10</b> and PCMM <b>40</b> with a configuration of probe heads <b>20</b>, <b>56</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the processor <b>70</b> can include a CMM controller <b>72</b> electrically coupled to a CMM probe controller <b>74</b>. The electric coupling is schematically illustrated as a wired connection <b>76</b>, however, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, the CMM controller <b>72</b> can be wirelessly coupled to the CMM probe controller <b>74</b>. In other embodiments, the CMM controller <b>72</b> and the CMM probe controller <b>74</b> can be integrated in a single integrated device. The touch trigger probe <b>82</b> is schematically illustrated as a switch having a wired connection <b>78</b> to the CMM probe controller <b>74</b>. Accordingly, when the touch trigger probe <b>82</b> contacts the hard probe <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>), a position signal is sent from the CMM <b>10</b> to the CMM probe controller <b>74</b>, which processes the signal and passes it along to the CMM controller <b>72</b> and the PCMM. The PCMM can be electrically coupled to the CMM between the CMM probe controller <b>74</b> and the CMM controller <b>72</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, this electrical coupling is illustrated as a sync cable <b>30</b> forming a wired connection between the CMM <b>40</b> and the wired connection <b>76</b> between the CMM probe controller <b>74</b> and the CMM controller <b>72</b>. Thus, in the illustrated configuration, when a contact position is made, a sync signal is sent over the sync cable <b>30</b> to the PCMM <b>40</b> to obtain position data.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, another probe head configuration for use in the calibration systems and methods described herein is illustrated.

The PCMM <b>40</b> can have a touch trigger <b>82</b> substantially as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. As described above, this configuration of probe heads can desirably allow multiple repositionings of the CMM and PCMM to generate a constellation of data sets for each position of the CMM.</p>

As illustrated, the touch trigger probe <b>82</b> is schematically illustrated as a switch on the PCMM <b>40</b>. The PCMM is electrically coupled over the sync cable <b>30</b> to a wired connection <b>78</b> between the hard probe <b>84</b> on the CMM <b>10</b> and the CMM probe controller <b>74</b>.

As discussed above with respect to other embodiments, it is contemplated that while wired connections are schematically illustrated herein, wireless connections, or other integration can be used in other embodiments to allow similar functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, another probe head configuration for use in the calibration systems and methods described herein is illustrated.

The PCMM <b>40</b> can have a hard probe <b>84</b> substantially as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. As described above, this configuration of probe heads can desirably allow multiple repositionings of the CMM and PCMM to generate a constellation of data sets for each position of the CMM.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>, the three-ball kinematic mount probe <b>90</b> can comprise a base plate <b>92</b> and three contact balls <b>94</b>. The contact balls <b>94</b> can be at least partially seated in the base plate <b>92</b> such that only a spherical portion protrudes from the surface of the base plate <b>92</b>. In some embodiments, the contact balls <b>94</b> need not be completely spherical. Rather, portions of spherical balls can be used. The contact balls <b>94</b> can be arranged to form a seat in the base plate. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the contact balls <b>94</b> are arranged as vertices of a substantially equilateral triangle, thus forming a seat in the base plate <b>92</b> defined by an interior of the triangle. A hard probe <b>84</b> can be positioned in the seat and simultaneously contact each of the three contact balls <b>94</b>. As further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, contact of the hard probe with the three contact balls <b>94</b> simultaneously activates an electrical switch. Simultaneous contact of fewer than all three of the contact balls <b>94</b> does not activate the switch. Desirably, this arrangement allows for repeated kinematic mounting and contact with all three of the contact balls <b>94</b> at various orientations by a hard probe or other probe head attachment. While the contact probe is illustrated as having three contact balls <b>94</b> arranged in a triangular configuration on the base plate <b>92</b> to provide repeatable kinematic mounting with a hard probe, in other embodiments, more or fewer than three contact balls <b>94</b> can be used.
