The display window is configured to simply display the operational state of the air conditioner with digit, arrow, shade, display of liquid crystal display (LCD), and so on. Because the display window which allows a user to observe the operational state of the air conditioner, is constructed too simply, the user cannot observe the operational state of the air conditioner at a glance. In other words, the user must look at digits or arrows near the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specifically, among home appliances, the air conditioner is installed in an indoor space or wall of an office or house so as to heat or cool its interior. The air conditioner includes a compressor, a condenser, an expansion value and an evaporator and performs a series of a refrigeration cycle. Generally, the air conditioner has a plurality of operational states, such as a dehumidifying state, a cooling state, and a rapid cooling state. However, the user must approach the indoor unit of the air conditioner so as to identify the operational state of the air conditioner. Even if a display window is installed in an indoor unit, the user must look at an arrow or appellation of the operational state near the indoor unit. Also, the complex operational state of the air conditioner can be perceived through digits, letters, arrows, symbols, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, the conventional air conditioner has drawbacks in that freshness and animation are lack because temperature, humidity and operational states are displayed in a static manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, an image displayed on the display window is predefined in a manufacturing step and cannot be changed. Therefore, the user is liable to be tired of the image and tends to purchase a new air conditioner, thereby reducing a use term of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, a virtual reality using the Internet connected through networks has been recently in the spotlight. In such a virtual reality, individuals feel satisfied on the Internet using their own characters as the other selves. A variety of contents industries associated with them are growing. These characters are called &#x201c;AVATA&#x201d;. Up to the present, the use of the AVATA is limited to the virtual space, which is connected through the Internet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner having an enhanced user perception, in which a character image displayed on a display window is changed depending on an operational state of the air conditioner, so that a user can perceive the operational state more conveniently. In order to enhance the user perception much more, the operational state of the air conditioner can be displayed in a voice.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner, which can enhance a user satisfaction much more by making a whole set of characters, which are displayed on a display window, changeable depending on a user's preference. A use term is also extended.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner, which can enhance a convenience in use of the air conditioner much more by implementing several kinds of display arrangement depending on a user's preference.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner having an enhanced user perception, in which a display window disposed at a front side of the air conditioner can be stably fixed to increase a readability of the display window.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner having an enhanced user perception, in which a display window can be assembled more conveniently and simply and a manufacturing process can be performed more conveniently.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">TECHNICAL SOLUTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to achieve the above objects, there is provided an air conditioner having an enhanced user perception, which includes: a panel forming an appearance of either side of the air conditioner; and a display part formed on the panel, for displaying a specific character and/or a character image of the character.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the present invention, an air conditioner having an enhanced user perception includes: a panel forming an appearance of either side of a home appliance; and a display part formed on the panel, for displaying a specific character and/or a character image of the character.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">BEST MODE</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. While the present invention will be particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention of the present invention as defined by the following claims. Although an air conditioner is exemplarily described herein, the present invention can be applied to other home appliances.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view illustrating a use state of an air conditioner according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an air conditioner according to the present invention includes a first indoor unit installed in an interior of a building, a second indoor unit <b>200</b> installed in a different space spaced apart from the first indoor unit <b>100</b>, an outdoor unit <b>10</b> communicating with the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> through a refrigerant pipe <b>12</b>, and a data input part <b>20</b> for controlling display windows of the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also, the data input part <b>20</b> is connected with the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> through a cable <b>104</b>. The outdoor unit <b>10</b> includes an outdoor fan <b>11</b> for performing a heat exchange with respect to a refrigerant. The data input part <b>20</b> may be a computer that is widely used at home. At least one of the cable <b>104</b>, a network and a wireless communication network can be applied to the computer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> include display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> on which at least character image is displayed. A variety of character images can be applied depending on kinds of the air conditioner. For example, a penguin image can be applied to an air conditioner and a duck image can be applied to a cooker. The character images may be previously stored in a storage medium provided inside the air conditioner, or may be directly inputted through the data input part <b>20</b> by a user. The character image is so large that the user can look the character image from a long distance and perceive the shape of the character image. The character may be an animal-shaped image. Except for the animal-shaped image, a mascot-like image whose meaning is perceivable may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, each of the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> can further include a state display window for accurately display an operational state of the air conditioner with a numerical value or arrow, as well as the character image.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, although one outdoor unit and two indoor units are exemplarily shown in this embodiment, the present invention can also be applied when one indoor unit is used. This is also included within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Among the above indoor units, the first indoor unit <b>100</b> is a floor standing type indoor unit and the second indoor unit <b>200</b> is a wall mount type indoor unit. Since a plurality of indoor units are installed in separated indoor spaces, the heating/cooling can be perfectly achieved with regard to a overall indoor area.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An operation of the air conditioner constructed as above will now be described in brief. First, a refrigerant to which a heat exchange is performed by the outdoor unit <b>10</b> flows through the pipe <b>12</b> to the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>, and the heating/cooling operation performed by the indoor units can be easily understood. Predetermined character images are displayed on the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> of the air conditioner. The character images may be an image that is previously stored in a storage medium provided inside the air conditioner, or an image that is arbitrarily inputted through the data input part by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also, the character images displayed on the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> may be an equal character but different image representing a corresponding operational state, depending on the operational states of the air conditioner. The character images may also be a still picture.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the character images are displayed in the above manner, the user can conveniently perceive the operational state of the air conditioner, and the convenience in use of the air conditioner and the product image can be improved much more.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of the first indoor unit <b>100</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the first indoor unit <b>100</b> includes a front panel <b>110</b> elongated up and down to form a front appearance, a side panel <b>120</b> forming a side appearance, a rear panel <b>130</b> forming a rear appearance, an upper panel <b>140</b> forming an upper appearance, and a base pan <b>150</b> forming a bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A user interface part disposed adjacent to the display part <b>160</b> will be described in detail. The display part <b>160</b> is disposed at an upper center of the front panel <b>110</b>. A set character image is displayed on the display part <b>160</b>. The display part <b>160</b> includes a liquid crystal display (LCD) and/or a light emitting device (LED). The character image may be an AVATA or any other images.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The LCD is a display device to which an operation of liquid crystal (LC) is applied. The liquid crystal will now be described in detail. Liquid crystal molecule is an intermediary substance between a liquid state and a solid state. The liquid crystal molecule is called an an isotropic liquid, because the molecular arrangement is regular in a certain direction, while the molecular arrangement is irregular in a different direction and the liquid crystal is optically in a crystal state. The liquid crystal that is an organic molecule having liquidity like a liquid is regularly arranged like a crystal. The LCD displays an image using a property that the molecular arrangement is changed due to an external electric field. The LCD has characteristics of slimness, light weight and low power consumption regardless of a screen size. Therefore, the LCD can be conveniently installed in the air conditioner having a narrow space. Also, the LCD can reproduce full colors using red, green and blue colors. Therefore, a colorful character image can be implemented without troubles. Since an operation principle of the LCD and a color reproducing method of a back light have been well known, their detailed descriptions will be omitted. Further, since the LED reproduces the red, green and blue colors through a light emitting semiconductor device, it can act as a display device and may be adapted for a large screen. Since the LCD can reproduce various colors, a user's aesthetic sense and preference to the product are enhanced much more.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The character image can be displayed in various shapes, and various AVATAs can be displayed depending on the operational states of the air conditioner. Specifically, the AVATA is used to exhibit the otherself of a specific individual on the virtual space. A specific character is disposed in various poses, locations, backgrounds and features without any change in the subject of the character. Therefore, it is useful to show various features to the user. For example, when the air conditioner is turned on, the character appears and greets with a bright smile. While the air conditioner is operating, the character acts variously depending on the operation modes. In other words, in a &#x201c;cooling operation&#x201d;, the character plays ball with a penguin, and in a &#x201c;dehumidifying operation&#x201d;, the character squeezes water from the clothes. Further, the character is different depending on a current temperature. For example, if the current temperature is higher than a desired temperature, the character perspires profusely, and if the current temperature is lower than the desired temperature, the character shrinks with cold. At this time, it is preferable to use the same character.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, the first indoor unit <b>100</b> is configured to inform the current operational state and temperature of the air conditioner with voice, in addition to the character image. In detail, the current state and operational state of the air conditioner are informed through a speaker in a human voice under a control of a controller (not shown), for example, &#x201c;This air conditioner is now in the cooling operation&#x201d;, &#x201c;A current temperature is 26 degrees&#x201d;, or &#x201c;A current air flow is strong&#x201d;. The information can be expressed corresponding to the shape of AVATA or separately without association with it. For this purpose, a storage medium and/or microphone for a recording function are/is provided inside the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. The user can record his or her own voice or replace the set voice with a separately recorded sound. Therefore, the operational state of the air conditioner is informed with the user's own voice or a separate melody. Of course, the voice can be stored through the data input part <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, the LCD of the display part <b>160</b> is set to a power saving mode in operation. If the operation of the air conditioner is stopped, the AVATA displayed on the display part <b>160</b> greets and disappears.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A receiving unit is further provided inside the first indoor unit <b>100</b> so as to download the AVATA through a direct connection or wireless connection with an external unit. The AVATA can be downloaded via the Internet, a line telephone and a cellular phone.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The data input part <b>20</b> is connected to the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. The data input part <b>20</b> is connected to the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> through the cable <b>104</b>, and more particularly, to the controller for controlling the display part <b>160</b>. Thus, the user can directly create or program desired character on the computer <b>20</b> and upload it to the controller. In addition, the user can download it through the communication networks, such as the Internet or the telephone. In other words, the user can access the Internet through the computer <b>20</b>, download the character provided from a corresponding website, and upload it to the controller. Also, the user can download the character through a mobile equipment such as a cellular phone and transmit it to the controllers of the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a state display part <b>170</b> is further provided in a lower portion of the display part <b>160</b>. The state display part <b>170</b> displays the operational state of the air conditioner with diagrams, letters and numerical values. Like the display part <b>160</b>, the state display part <b>170</b> can be configured with an LCD or LED. Also, a plurality of manipulation buttons <b>180</b> are provided on both sides of the display part <b>160</b>. The operation of the air conditioner can be set using the manipulation buttons <b>180</b>. Further, the manipulation buttons are used to set or modify the display part <b>160</b>. Of course, the air conditioner can be operated by a remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial enlarged view of the front panel of the air conditioner according to the present invention. A construction of the display part <b>160</b> will be fully understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a functional operation of the air conditioner will now be described in brief. An inlet port <b>122</b> is formed at the side panel <b>120</b> providing a side appearance of the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. An air is introduced from an indoor space through the inlet port <b>122</b>. An inlet grill <b>124</b> is further installed in an outer side of the inlet port <b>122</b>. An air filter (not shown) for filtering foreign substance contained in the introduced air is further provided in an inner side of the inlet grill <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The upper panel <b>140</b> moves up and down. In other words, the upper panel <b>140</b> is supported by a supporter <b>142</b>, which is provided in right and left sides and front and rear sides, and moves upwards. At the rear side, a rear blocking plate <b>144</b> slides from an upper end of the first indoor unit <b>100</b> and is protruded upwards. A plurality of outlet ribs <b>146</b> are formed in right and left sides of the supporter <b>142</b>. The outlet ribs <b>146</b> are formed up and down spaced apart from each other by a predetermined interval. The outlet ribs <b>146</b> guide a discharge direction, so that the air discharged from the inside of the first indoor unit <b>100</b> upwards can be discharged in a front or side direction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, a heat exchanger (not shown) is installed inside the first indoor unit <b>100</b>, allowing a heat exchange between the air introduced through the inlet port <b>122</b> and the refrigerant flowing through the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. A blowing fan (not shown) and a motor (not shown) are embedded. The blowing fan forcibly blows the air so as to again discharge the air, which is introduced through the inlet port <b>122</b>, to the indoor space through the upper end of the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. The motor produces a rotational power to the blowing fan.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, the outdoor unit <b>10</b> performs a refrigeration cycle of the air conditioner together with the indoor units <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. Although not shown, a plurality of parts, such as a compressor for compressing the refrigerant and an outdoor heat exchanger for performing a heat exchange, are embedded in the inside of the outdoor unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are a front view and a side view illustrating an operation of the air conditioner according to the present invention, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An operation of the air conditioner, specifically the first indoor unit <b>100</b>, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. First, a case when the air conditioner operates in a cooling mode will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The air conditioner is driven using the remote controller or by pressing the manipulation button <b>180</b>. If the air conditioner begins to operate, the air of the indoor space is introduced into the first indoor unit <b>100</b> through the inlet port <b>122</b>. The air filter (not shown) filters foreign substance from the introduced air. The heat exchanger (not shown) provided inside the first indoor unit <b>100</b> performs a heat exchanger between the air and the refrigerant, thereby reducing the temperature. At this time, the heat exchanger provided inside the first indoor unit <b>100</b> acts as the evaporator. Therefore, the air introduced from the indoor space is deprived of heat by the refrigerant flowing through the heat exchanger, thereby reducing the temperature. The cooled air is introduced into the blowing fan (not shown). The blowing fan (not shown) forcibly blows the air upwards and discharges it into the indoor space.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Meanwhile, when the air conditioner operates, the upper panel <b>140</b> moves upwards. Accordingly, the outlet rib <b>146</b> provided in the supporter <b>142</b> is exposed externally. The air which is forcibly blown upwards by the blowing fan, collides with a bottom surface of the upper panel <b>140</b> and circles in a lateral direction. The rear blocking plate <b>144</b> is integrally formed at the rear end of the upper panel <b>140</b>. The rear blocking plate <b>144</b> slides upwards together with the upper panel <b>140</b> and is exposed. Therefore, the air discharged upwards is not discharged in a rear direction but discharged a front or side direction. At this time, the air is discharged toward the indoor space in such a state that the discharge direction is adjusted by the outlet rib <b>146</b>. As a result, the air discharged into the indoor space is a cooled air, whose heat is exchanged by the heat exchanger. Therefore, a cool air is supplied to the indoor space and thus a cooling operation is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Meanwhile, like the first indoor unit <b>100</b>, a heat exchange is also performed in the outdoor unit <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). In other words, when the air conditioner operates in the cooling mode, the heat exchanger of the first indoor unit <b>100</b> acts as the evaporator, while the heat exchanger of the outdoor unit <b>10</b> acts as the condenser. Accordingly, the temperature of the external air introduced into the outdoor unit <b>10</b> is increased and then discharged into the outside. In this manner, the cooling operation is performed in the first indoor unit <b>100</b> and the heating operation is performed. As a whole, one refrigeration cycle is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the air conditioner operates in the cooling mode, the display part <b>160</b> is also turned on so that various AVATAs appear and inform the operational states of the air conditioner. For example, when the air conditioner is initially turned on, the set AVATA appears and greets with a bright smile. In the cooling mode, an image that the AVATA plays ball with a penguin in the South Pole can be displayed. Of course, if the user sets other character, other shape can be displayed. If the cooling operation is still necessary because the current temperature does not reach the set temperature, an image that the AVATA perspires profusely can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Also, while the air conditioner operates, the operational state can be informed in the voice, except that the character is displayed on the display part <b>160</b>. For example, when the air conditioner operates in the cooling mode, a message of &#x201c;this air conditioner is now in the cooling operation&#x201d; is outputted through the speaker <b>190</b>. If the user inputs a recorded voice or melody, a corresponding message may be outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A case when the air conditioner operates in the heating mode will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Like the cooling mode, a heat exchange is performed with respect to the indoor air introduced through the inlet port <b>122</b> of the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. Then, the air is again discharged into the indoor space through the upper end of the first indoor unit <b>100</b>. At this time, the refrigeration cycle is reversibly performed. Therefore, the heat exchanger embedded in the first indoor unit <b>100</b> acts as the condenser, so that the temperature of the introduced indoor air rises. As described above, when the air conditioner is turned on, the display part <b>160</b> is also turned on to display the greeting AVATA. If the user selects the heating mode, the set image of the AVATA is displayed. For example, an image that the AVATA bathes in the sea can be displayed. Also, various images can be displayed depending on the programs set by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Simultaneously, a message of &#x201c;this air conditioner is now in the heating operation&#x201d; is outputted through the speaker <b>190</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). Such a message can also be variously changed depending on the user's setup.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, if the current temperature is lower than the desired temperature, an image that the character shrinks with cold can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">If the user turns off the air conditioner, the AVATA greets cutely and disappears. In this manner, the heating operation of the air conditioner can be ended.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Meanwhile, if the user does not like the character image and voice from the display part <b>160</b> or if the user wants to use his or her own character image and voice, the program can be downloaded using the communication equipment, such as the Internet or cellular phone, or can directly input it.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 15</figref> are views illustrating the construction and operation of the second indoor unit in the air conditioner according to the present invention. The second indoor unit is the wall mount type and has a small size, so that an installation space for the display part is small and an air discharge space is narrow. Therefore, an additional structure for mounting the display part is required. Thus, the second indoor unit must be formed in a specific structure, which can meet such requirements.</p>

Also, it will be apparent from the spirit of the present invention that the joining manner of the state display part <b>300</b> can be applied, in the same way, to the manner in which the display part <b>350</b> is settled on the case and joined to the front frame <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The operational state of the display part will now be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">On the first place, if a user transmits an operation signal by pressing, in person, the operation button <b>355</b> or through the remote controller <b>710</b> and the receiving part <b>357</b> receives the operation signal, the second indoor unit <b>200</b> operates. Also, the moment the second indoor unit <b>200</b> operates, a power source is applied to the display part <b>350</b> and a specific character image stored in advance or input by a user, is displayed. For example, it is possible to have a character that have been sleeping wakes up. Also, simultaneously, it is possible to inform the operation of the second indoor unit <b>200</b> with a voice through the speaker <b>730</b> connected with the display part <b>350</b>. Also, the voice may be downloaded through the mobile means <b>700</b> or the data inputting apparatus <b>720</b>, or recorded and stored in the memory chip <b>354</b> by a user in person.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Also, while an amount of air, an indoor temperature, humidity, an operation time are displayed on the state display part <b>300</b>, the character may perform a proper gesture depending on an amount of air, an indoor temperature, humidity, or a voice informing such information may be announced through the speaker <b>730</b>. For example, a user can set in such a way that if a present temperature is below the proper temperature programmed in advance, the character may perform a gesture shivering with cold, and simultaneously, a guiding message informing that the indoor temperature is too low may be announced through the speaker. Also, if the second indoor unit <b>200</b> is turned off, the character may perform a gesture falling asleep and a guiding message informing that the operation of the second indoor unit <b>200</b> is stopped may be announced through the speaker <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Also, a user may arbitrarily select the kind of the AVATA using the selection button <b>356</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a block diagram explaining a control state of the air conditioner according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, there are provided a key inputting part <b>31</b> with which a control state of the air conditioner is operated by a user; a power source part <b>32</b> for applying a power source to the air conditioner; an data inputting apparatus <b>33</b> for inputting a specific character and a plurality of character images using the character, to the air conditioner; a controlling part <b>30</b> where a control state of the air conditioner is stored in a storing medium formed in the inside of the air conditioner and for controlling the operation of the air conditioner using the input information; an operational state display part <b>34</b> on which at least character image is displayed under the control of the controlling part <b>30</b>; a voice outputting part <b>35</b> for outputting the operational state of the air conditioner in a voice under the control of the controlling part <b>30</b>; a fan operating part <b>36</b> for controlling the operational state of the outdoor unit and/or the indoor unit, under the control of the controlling part <b>30</b>; and a compressor operating part <b>37</b> for circulating a coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">More specifically, the key inputting part <b>31</b>, which is a part with which a user operates the operational state of the air conditioner, may be at least one selected among a remote controller of the air conditioner, a button formed on the appearance of the apparatus, a computer system connected through wiring/wireless network. Also, the data inputting part <b>33</b> is a device for generating or downloading a character and a plurality of character images where the specific character appears and transferring the same to the controlling part <b>30</b>. For such a data inputting part <b>33</b>, at least one among a computer, a mobile means, a remote controller, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Also, the operational state display part <b>34</b> formed on the air conditioner, preferably, a predetermined outer side of the indoor unit, is a part through which the operational state of the air conditioner may be displayed to a user in an easy and simple manner with the character image displayed. Preferably, the operational state display part <b>34</b> is realized by the LCD so that a user may recognize the character image in a convenient and beautiful manner.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">By displaying, as described above, the character image on the operational state display part <b>34</b>, a user can recognize the operational state of the air conditioner in a more easy and convenient manner. Particularly, since a shape of the character image changes depending on the operational state of the air conditioner, a user can recognize the operational state of the air conditioner in even more easy and convenient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Also, the voice outputting part <b>35</b>, which is a part for outputting the operational state of the air conditioner in form of a voice, can output the operational state of the air conditioner in form of a voice depending on a user's desire.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Also, the fan operating part <b>36</b> and the compressor operating part <b>37</b>, which are apparatuses for circulating a coolant in the inside of the cooling cycle to get a coolant to pass through processes of compression, condensation, expansion, and evaporation in accordance with the operational state by a user, are on/off-controlled by the controlling part <b>30</b> depending on the operational state and the indoor temperature of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The operation of the air conditioner will be briefly described with reference to the block diagram of the described air conditioner system. The air conditioner system of the present invention can be operated in three modes. A first mode is a character image uploading mode for uploading a character image into the controlling part <b>30</b> in the inside of the air conditioner using the data inputting part <b>33</b>. A second mode is a character image display mode where the air conditioner system is operated by operation of the key inputting part <b>31</b> by a user and the character image is displayed on the operational state display part <b>34</b>. A third mode is a character and a character image selecting mode for selecting a set of character images related to a specific character.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As described above, by making the kind of the character image changed depending on the operational state of the air conditioner, the recognition of a user can be convenient even more. Also, since a specific character is selected in accordance with a taste of a user and a specific set of character images can be selected among a plurality of character images where the character is used, a user can display a character fit for a user's taste, on the air conditioner in a convenient manner. For an extreme example, a user's picture may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the meantime, the character and the character image selecting mode is easily performed by cooperative operation of the key inputting part <b>31</b> and the controlling part <b>30</b>. More specifically, after the process for selecting a character is performed, a specific character image is selected among a plurality of character images related to the selected character, for each operational state of the air conditioner. Of course, if a user desires, a specific character needs not to be used in a related set, for each operational state of the air conditioner, and other character image where other character is used, may be set for each operational state of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Therefore, the character image uploading mode and the character image display mode will be described in detail in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flowchart explaining the character image uploading mode according to the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a user obtains a character and/or a character image by downloading through a network or by producing, in person, the character image (S<b>11</b>). For the process in which the character is generated, any type of method such as wiring/wireless network and a producing by a user, may be used without limitations. Of course, when the air conditioner is brought to the market, a plurality of characters, a plurality of character images where a pose, a background, a position, and a movement are different for each character, may be stored in a set in the storing medium in the inside of the controlling part <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Afterwards, a user uploads the generated character image to the controlling part <b>30</b> through the data inputting part <b>33</b> (S<b>12</b>). The uploading process can be easily performed through a LAN (Local Area Network) and wiring/wireless Internet. The character and the character image uploaded in this manner, are stored in the storing medium of the controlling part <b>30</b> (S<b>13</b>), and upon calling by a user, one set of character images to which a specific character is applied, is called and used in the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flowchart explaining the character image display mode of the air conditioner to which the spirit of the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the operation of the air conditioner is started by an input or reservation setting of a user (S<b>21</b>). If the operation of the air conditioner is started, one set of character images selected in advance by a user is called and a character image appropriate for a present state, initial operation of the air conditioner, is displayed on the operational state display part <b>34</b> on the first place (S<b>22</b>). If a selected character is absent at the present point of time, selection of a character may be automatically requested on the first place, or one set of character images designated from the time of manufacturing of the air conditioner, may be called.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Afterwards, it is judged whether the operational state of the air conditioner is changed while the operation of the air conditioner is continuously performed (S<b>23</b>). If the operational state of the air conditioner is changed, a new character image appropriated for the changed operational state of the air conditioner among the called one set of character images, is automatically displayed in accordance with the changed operational state of the air conditioner (S<b>24</b>). If the operational state of the air conditioner is not changed, the character image of the present state is continuously displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">If the operation of the air conditioner is ended while the new changed character image is displayed, a character image of ended state is displayed (S<b>26</b>) and the operation of the air conditioner is ended. However, if the operation of the air conditioner is not ended, the process is moved to the step of judging a change of the operational state of the air conditioner (S<b>23</b>), and the process for changing the character image is repeated until the air conditioner is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In case a user sets a specific character image in advance, for each operational state of the air conditioner, in performing the character image display mode as described above, not only the character image included in one set related to a single character but also another character image where another character is used, may be displayed for each operational state of the air conditioner in accordance with a taste of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">With a Whini, character that will be set in advance in the storing medium of the product, taken as an example, changing of the character image according to the gesture, the pose, the position, and the background will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a character image displayed in the start/stop mode of the operation of the air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, upon starting of the operation, the character image moving from the lower side to the upper side is displayed. On the contrary, upon ending of the operation, the character image moving from the character image on the upper side to the character image on the lower side, is displayed on the operational state display part <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a character image displayed in the cooling operation mode of the air conditioner. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, upon the general cooling operation, the character image on the upper side is displayed and upon a power cooling operation, the character image on the lower side is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a character image displayed in the dehumidifying operation mode of the air conditioner. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, upon the dehumidifying operation mode, the character images on the upper side and on the lower side are alternately displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a character image displayed in the artificial intelligence operation mode of the air conditioner. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, upon the artificial intelligence operation mode, the character images on the upper side and on the lower side are alternately displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a character image displayed in the plasma clean operation mode of the air conditioner. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, upon the plasma clean operation mode, the character images on the upper side and on the lower side are alternately displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">As shown in the character images exemplified by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 23</figref>, even under the state that the same character appears as a major character, the character image displayed on the operational state display part <b>34</b> is varied in detail in accordance with the change of the operational state of the air conditioner. Since the displayed character is changed in this manner, a user can check the operational state of the air conditioner in a more easy manner. Also, by the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> formed on the front of the air conditioner, the air conditioner can be quality-enhanced and a taste of a user can be satisfied even more.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Further, in case the character and the character image are set differently for each operational state of the air conditioner according to a taste of a user, there is a strong point that even the same air conditioner can be used for a long time as if it were a new apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The second embodiment of the present invention is the same in most part as the first embodiment. Only difference is that the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b> on which at least a character image is displayed and the state display parts <b>170</b> and <b>300</b> on which the operational state of the air conditioner is displayed with a number or an arrow, are not formed separately but one or both two are displayed on a single LCD window by a selection of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">More specifically, in the first embodiment, the display parts <b>160</b> and <b>350</b>, and the state display parts <b>170</b> and <b>300</b> are separately formed on both the first indoor unit <b>100</b> and the second indoor unit <b>200</b>. However, in that case, since the wide area on the front side of the indoor unit is occupied, it is not preferable in viewpoints of costs and use. Therefore, there is provided a method where a state that a character image is selectively displayed on a single display part by a selection of a user (for example, the display part of the first embodiment), or a state that the operational state of the air conditioner is displayed with letters (for example, the state display part of the first embodiment), are selectively displayed or both state are all displayed with use of the characteristics of the LCD where various screen configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> show the operational state of the display part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows that the character image is displayed on the display part and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows the operational state of the air conditioner is displayed on the display part.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, there are provided a front panel <b>810</b> formed on a front of the air conditioner; a side panel <b>820</b> formed on the side of the air conditioner; a display window <b>860</b> formed on the front panel <b>810</b>; an operation button <b>880</b> formed on one side of the display window <b>860</b>, for operating the operational state of the air conditioner; a selection button <b>871</b> formed on the other side of the display window <b>860</b>, for switching a screen displayed on the display window <b>860</b>, into a display part where a character image is displayed or a state display part where the operational state of the air conditioner is displayed with letters; and a character setting button <b>872</b> for selecting the kind of a character or the kind of a character image. Also, for the display window <b>860</b>, the LCD is preferably used as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">For other parts of the present embodiment, the descriptions made for the first embodiment are quoted. Particularly, the selection button <b>871</b> will be described in detail. By a number of times the selection button <b>871</b> is pressed, the display window <b>860</b> operates as the display part <b>861</b> where the character image is displayed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) or operates as the state display part <b>862</b> where the operational state of the air conditioner is displayed with letters (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). Of course, it will be easily estimated that both the display part <b>861</b> and the state display part <b>862</b> can be all displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Also, it is possible to have a specific kind of characters and a specific kind of character images selected if the character setting button <b>872</b> is pressed. Also, in case a plurality of character setting buttons <b>872</b> is provided, a button for selecting a character and a button for selecting a character image can be separately provided, for each kind of buttons.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODE FOR INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The present invention is characterized in that a predetermined display window is realized on the front of the air conditioner and a character image in which a predetermined character image is used, is displayed on the display window. Also, the present invention is characterized in that a user can use the air conditioner in a more convenient manner thanks to the character and the character image related to the character.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Within the range satisfying the above characteristics, the air conditioner capable of improving the user's recognizability according to the present invention, can have various form in its embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">On the first place, in case two indoor units are not used but a single indoor unit is used in a single outdoor unit, an effect that a user's convenience is improved can be obtained by realizing, on the single indoor unit, a display window on which a character and/or a character image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Also, the spirit of the present invention can be applied not only to the air conditioner that has been described by the detailed embodiment, but also to other electronic appliances such as a cooking apparatus and a refrigerator, with change in its form in a convenient manner. At this time, with the character maintained as it is, the operational state of the air conditioner can be displayed by changing a pose, a position, a background, and a behavior of the character.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Also, even though the apparatus and/or method for inputting, selecting, or setting a character and a character image may be changed depending on detail use conditions, such changes will not influence on realization of the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Also, for the character image displayed on the display part, not only the character image where the character is used, but also a character of a representative shape may be constantly displayed regardless of the operational state of the air conditioner. In case of the air conditioner, it will be preferable that a character that can emphasize coolness such as a penguin is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention.
