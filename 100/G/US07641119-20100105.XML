<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. P2004-84010, filed on Oct. 20, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to bar code label stickers, and more particularly, to a bar code label sticker with a first sticker and a second sticker of which use and keeping is convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the bar code label sticker has two stickers separated by a line along which to cut off (a cutoff line) the two stickers, wherein one of the stickers is attached to a package box, and the other is attached to a management pocket notebook or account book, for easy management and classification of the goods later.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a related art bar code label sticker will be described, wherein the sticker to be attached to the package box is called as a first sticker, and the sticker to be attached to the pocket notebook or the like for management is called as a second sticker.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, for the sake of convenience, a bar code label on the first sticker is called as a first bar code label, and a bar code label on the second sticker is called as a second bar code label.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a related art bar code label sticker is provided with three layers in total of a base <b>30</b>, a middle sticker <b>20</b> attached to the base <b>30</b>, and an upper sticker <b>10</b> on the middle sticker <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a cutoff line <b>18</b> on the upper sticker <b>10</b> crossing the upper sticker <b>10</b> in a left/right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Over the cutoff line <b>18</b>, there is the first sticker <b>12</b> having a first bar code label <b>4</b> for attachment to the package box, and under the cutoff line <b>18</b>, there is the second sticker <b>14</b> having the second bar code label <b>5</b> for attachment to the management notebook, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The upper sticker <b>10</b> and the middle sticker <b>20</b> have the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For easy detachment of the middle sticker <b>20</b> from the base <b>30</b>, the base <b>30</b> has a length and a width greater than a length and a width of the middle sticker <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">That is, by providing a predetermined surplus portion at the base <b>30</b> on which the middle sticker <b>20</b> is not to be attached, detachment of the middle sticker <b>20</b> from the base <b>30</b> becomes easy.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the meantime, the first bar code label <b>4</b> on the first sticker <b>12</b> has information on kind, and number of goods, and the second bar code label <b>5</b> has the same information as the first sticker <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the related art bar code label sticker as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, back surfaces of the upper sticker <b>10</b> and the middle sticker <b>20</b> have adhesive applied thereto, and front surfaces of the middle sticker <b>20</b> and the base <b>30</b> opposite to above back surfaces have vinyl, or the like coated thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A method for using the related art bar code label sticker will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">First, the middle sticker <b>20</b> is detached from the base <b>30</b>, and attached on an outside of the package box.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this case, the upper sticker <b>10</b> is kept attached to the middle sticker <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Then, only the second sticker <b>14</b> of the upper sticker <b>10</b> is detached from the middle sticker <b>20</b> for management of goods.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this instance, the second sticker <b>14</b> may be detached together with the middle sticker <b>20</b> by a size of the second sticker <b>14</b> from the package box.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">After attaching the second sticker <b>14</b> on the pocket notebook or account book separately for management, the second sticker <b>14</b> is compared to the first bar code label <b>4</b> on the upper sticker <b>10</b> attached on the outside surface of the package box later, for management and control of kinds and number of goods.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, the related art bar code label sticker described above has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">First, the three layered sticker with the upper sticker, the middle sticker, and the base has a complicate fabrication process, and a high material cost.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Second, in a case the second sticker is detached, if the second sticker is not attached to the pocket notebook or the account book at once, keeping of the second sticker is substantially troublesome due to the adhesive on the one surface of the second ticker.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Third, if the middle sticker is detached together with the second sticker in order to solve the second problem, due to the adhesive on the middle sticker too, a portion of a surface of the package box is also detached together with the middle sticker if the package box is formed of paper, damaging the package box, the package box can have a poor outer appearance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a bar code label sticker that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An object of the present invention is to provide a bar code label sticker use of which becomes more convenient.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, the first base <b>110</b> is separated from the second base <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the second sticker <b>220</b> is in a state unattached to the package box owing to the second base <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Then, if the second sticker <b>220</b> is separated from the first sticker <b>210</b> along the second cutoff line <b>280</b> in a state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the second sticker <b>220</b> attached to the second base <b>120</b> can be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Or, after detaching the first sticker <b>210</b> from the first base <b>110</b> , and separating the first base <b>110</b> from the second base <b>120</b> along the first cutoff line <b>180</b>, the first sticker <b>210</b> may be attached to the outside of the package box of goods.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Or, though not shown, as another embodiment of the present invention, the bar code label sticker of the present invention may not have the 1A cutoff line <b>1</b>A or the 2A cutoff line <b>2</b>A which separates the first sticker <b>210</b> or the first base <b>110</b> into two parts, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Effects of the bar code label sticker of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described, even after the first sticker <b>210</b> is separated from the second sticker <b>220</b>, the second sticker <b>220</b> is in a state the second sticker <b>220</b> is attached to the second base <b>120</b>, enabling to prevent the second sticker <b>220</b> from attaching to other thing, thereby permitting easy keeping of the second sticker <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, after keeping the second sticker <b>220</b> with the second base <b>120</b> attached thereto separately, only the sticker <b>220</b> may be attached to the pocket notebook or the like after detaching the second sticker <b>220</b> from the second base <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, the easy management of the second sticker permits more convenient use than the related art bar code label sticker, substantially.</p>
