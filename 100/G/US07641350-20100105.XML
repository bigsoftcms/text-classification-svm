<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/740,148 filed Nov. 28, 2005, entitled &#x201c;Front Surface Mirror for providing White Color Uniformity for Polarized Systems with a Large Range of Incidence Angles&#x201d;, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to projection systems and methods and more particularly to a coated fold mirror for use in a compact projection system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a front projection system, a projector and a viewer are on the same side of a display surface, with an image from the projector reflecting from the display surface to the viewer. Front projection systems are typically on-axis projection systems in which the image is created and projected along a straight axis that is perpendicular to the display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a rear-projection system, a projector and a viewer are on the opposite sides of a screen. Rear projection television (RPTV) displays have found great consumer interest due to a large image size. A primary disadvantage of an RPTV system is a set volume and depth. In RPTV systems, minimizing the straight line projection path length by folding the optical path enables a cabinet housing a display surface and a projection light engine to be more compact. Thus, the optical path along which light propagates through these projection systems is typically folded with a large front surface mirror (FSM), known in the art as a fold mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an example of a prior art rear-projection system <b>1</b> comprising a light engine <b>3</b>, a projection lens <b>5</b>, a fold mirror <b>7</b>, and a screen <b>9</b>. The light engine <b>3</b> introduces light into the projection lens <b>5</b>, which, in turn, projects the light onto the fold mirror <b>7</b> which reflects the light onto the screen <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In RPTV systems, images are composed by modulating the intensity of red, green, and blue components of light so as to form constantly changing images. As used herein, the term &#x201c;component&#x201d;, or a light beam, refers to a portion of a light transmission. For example, where a light transmission contains light of various wavelengths in the visible spectrum (e.g., blue, red, and green), the light transmission may be separated into a plurality of components, each corresponding to a range of wavelengths (i.e., color bands), such as blue, red, or green, in the visible spectrum. Further, a light transmission may comprise polarized light oriented in one or more planes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, a polarization-based RPTV system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,634,756 issued to Shimizu on Oct. 21, 2003, incorporated herein by reference. A rear-projection display system comprises a light source, a polarizing beam-splitter (PBS) that receives light from the light source, a projection lens that receives an image from the beam-splitter, a rear-projection screen, and a fold mirror that receives the image from the projection lens and reflects it onto the screen. In this system the beam-splitter having an inclined reflecting element is placed between an LCoS imager and a projection lens that projects the light onto a fold mirror whence it is reflected onto a screen. The beam-splitter receives an image, and reflects the image off the reflecting element at an angle of incidence that is substantially unequal to 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A part of an RPTV system, namely a polarization-based color management system, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,678,015 in the names of Yi et al issued on Jan. 13, 2004 incorporated herein by reference. The systems comprises: a dichroic filter for allowing a selected one of light components, included in an incident light emitted from a light source, to be transmitted therethrough along a travel path of the incident light while reflecting the remaining light components in a direction perpendicular to the travel path of the incident light; a first synthesizing unit for receiving the light components reflected by the dichroic filter and separating the received light components from each other, the first synthesizing unit also serving to form images respectively corresponding to the separated light components via a first liquid crystal display (LCD) and a second LCD, to synthesize the images, and to allow the synthesized image to be directed in the same direction as the incident light introduced into the dichroic filter; a second synthesizing unit for receiving the light component transmitted through the dichroic filter, forming an image corresponding to the received light component via a third LCD, and reflecting the image in a direction perpendicular to the travel path of the incident light introduced into the dichroic filter; and a third synthesizing unit for synthesizing light beams respectively containing the images formed in the first and second synthesizing units, and allowing the synthesized light to be directed in the same direction as the incident light introduced into the dichroic filter. The first synthesizing unit comprises: a first color selecting retarder; a polarized beam splitter; the first LCD; the second LCD; and a second color selecting retarder. The second synthesizing unit comprises: a third color selecting retarder; a second polarized beam splitter; and a third LCD. The third synthesizing unit may comprises a third polarized beam splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In optical systems using one or more mirrors that fold the beam path to the output screen, it is desired for the white light incident on the screen to be of uniform intensity and white uniformity across the entire viewing screen although, most often, it is not achieved. Quality of the image on the screen depends, in part, on reflectance of the fold mirror defined in the art as a ratio of energy of reflected to incident light. Besides properties of the mirror, a value of reflectance depends on properties of the incident light, in particular on an angle of incidence (AOI) of the light. In RPTV systems, different portions of a beam of light impinge on a fold mirror with largely varying angles of incidence causing variations in reflectance across the mirror surface. Furthermore, since a value of reflectance depends on polarization of incident light, reflectance for differently colored sub-beams, or components, varies differently contributing to image distortion. Thus special efforts need to be taken to provide uniform intensity and white color uniformity across the viewing screen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are known in the art methods of modifying a fold mirror in order to reduce image distortion:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 6,648,482 in the names of Hatakeyama et al issued on Nov. 18, 2003, discloses a polygon mirror comprising a reflecting surface and a single-layer film of uneven thickness, designed to ensure that variation in reflectance is small over a wide range of angles of incidence. The method of manufacturing the prism shaped polygon mirror having a film on the reflecting surface comprises a step of forming a coated film of a solution on the reflecting surface by rotating the polygon mirror, and the solution is applied only in the area of which the distance from the axis of rotation of the polygon mirror is at least Ri in the application step, where Ri is the minimum distance between the reflecting surface and the axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">US Pat. Appl. No. 20040141157 by Ramachandran et al discloses an image projection system comprising a asymmetrically curved mirror for distortion compensation of an optical image.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">US Pat. Appl. No. 20040057116 by Ogawa, discloses an optical filter comprising a substrate and an optical conversion film inclined with respect to the substrate by being continuously thinner from one end to another end, the optical conversion film comprising two types of thin films and having different refractive indices and being alternately stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The aforementioned references are all incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although the aforementioned methods of altering the fold mirror by using a curved reflective surface and/or uneven covering layers appear to perform their intended function, they provide elaborate and expensive solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a simple and cost-effective method for image distortion reduction in a polarization-based rear-projection system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is another object of this invention to increase a white balance across the viewing screen by lessening the intensity difference between light of differing orthogonal polarizations reflected from the fold mirror in an optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is another object of this invention to increase the visible white balance across the viewing screen by lessening the variation in intensity of green light over a range of angles of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is a further object of this invention to provide a mirror with a coating designed to lessen a perceived variation in white color balance of light reflected across the coating wherein the white light is comprised of sub-beams of orthogonal polarization states.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An exemplary embodiment of the current invention will be described herein. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a rear-projection display system comprises a beam-forming means <b>110</b>, a fold mirror <b>100</b>, and a rear projection screen <b>120</b>. The beam forming means <b>110</b>, herein also referred to as a light engine <b>110</b>, comprises a light source, e.g. an Osram UHP 150 W lamp, an optional polarizing light pipe, e.g. made by Casix Inc., and a color management system, e.g. ColorQuad&#x2122; from Colorlink. A preferred color management system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,857,747 in the names of Pentico et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the color management system <b>200</b> includes a light separator <b>220</b>, a first image assimilator <b>230</b>, a second image assimilator <b>240</b>, a first analyzer <b>235</b>, a second analyzer <b>245</b>, and a light combiner <b>250</b>. Light separator <b>220</b> is a dichroic beamsplitter; it receives a light beam <b>210</b> from a source, separates the light beam <b>210</b> into two or more components <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and emits two or more light beams <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, each comprising one or more of the components. First output light beam <b>222</b> comprises a red component <b>212</b> and second output light beam <b>224</b> comprises a blue component <b>214</b> and a green component <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first image assimilator <b>230</b>, which comprises first polarizing beamsplitter <b>232</b> and first microdisplay <b>234</b>, is positioned to receive first output light beam <b>222</b>. A second image assimilator <b>240</b>, which comprises second polarizing beamsplitter <b>242</b> and second microdisplay <b>244</b>, is positioned to receive second output light beam <b>224</b>. Microdisplays <b>234</b>, <b>244</b> are configured to superimpose spatial information on the light beam so as to produce a light beam that comprises spatial information. First image assimilator <b>230</b> receives a first output light beam <b>222</b>, rotates its polarization orientation, imparts first spatial information on it, and emits a first modified light beam <b>236</b> comprising first spatial information and noise. Second image assimilator <b>240</b> receives second output light beam <b>224</b>, rotates its polarization orientation, imparts second spatial information on it, and emits a second modified light beam <b>246</b> comprising second spatial information and noise.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Image assimilator <b>240</b> comprises a polarizing filter for producing a differentiated light output comprising the second component <b>214</b> and the third component <b>216</b>, where the orientation of the second component <b>214</b> is rotated to be orthogonal to the orientation of the third component <b>216</b>. Image assimilator <b>240</b> further comprises a second polarizing beansplitter positioned to receive from the polarizing filter the differentiated light output. This second polarizing beamsplitter is configured for separating the second component <b>214</b> from the third component <b>216</b> before substantially transmitting the second component to be received by the second microdisplay and before substantially transmitting the third component to be received by a third microdisplay.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The color management system <b>200</b> also includes analyzers <b>235</b>, <b>245</b> for noise reduction and a light combiner <b>250</b> for combining the filtered light beams <b>237</b>, <b>247</b> into a single filtered light output <b>255</b>. The light engine is configured so that a polarization vector of the second beam <b>247</b> is parallel to the mirror, so the second beam <b>247</b> is hereinafter also referred to as a beam of s-polarized light, and the first beam <b>237</b>&#x2014;as a beam of p-polarized light. Finally, the color management system includes a projection lens <b>270</b> for projecting an output light beam containing spatial information for projecting an image. Therefore, the beam-forming means forms the light beam <b>255</b> comprising p-polarized green light and s-polarized red and blue light.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, light engine <b>110</b> forms the light beam represented by rays <b>130</b>. The light beam <b>130</b> impinges on the mirror <b>100</b> and is reflected by the mirror <b>100</b> to the screen <b>120</b> as shown by rays <b>131</b>. An angle between the impinging light <b>130</b> and a normal <b>150</b> to the mirror <b>100</b> is an angle of incidence (AOI) <b>140</b>. The angle of incidence varies across the mirror <b>100</b>, which is a flat quadrilateral with a narrow side <b>310</b> disposed closer to the light engine <b>110</b> than a wider side <b>320</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides AOI values for different footprint locations of the mirror thus showing that, in this exemplary embodiment, the light beam impinge on the mirror <b>100</b> at all angles from a range of angles of incidence between 9.5 and 65 degrees; the angles of incidence vary from 9.5 degrees at the point <b>143</b> to 65 degrees at the point <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, the aforedescribed system wherein mirror <b>100</b> comprised a conventional front surface mirror, e.g. HR94, did not provide a sufficient color uniformity across the viewing screen <b>120</b>, that is white light in certain regions of the viewing screen appeared to be tinted rather than being a pure white. It has been discovered, that the green component was less uniform in intensity across the screen <b>120</b> than the red and blue components. Furthermore, the human eye is more sensitive to changes in green than red or blue, so correcting for this variance in intensity of the green light was required.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After analyzing and attempting to understand the difference in variance in intensity for different colors of light, it was found that the variance in intensity for light incident on the mirror at different angles was substantially affected by the particular linear polarization state the light was propagating in, rather than by the color, or wavelength band, of the light itself. Thus, the fact that the green light varied in intensity across the screen more than the red or blue light at different angles of incidence, was discovered to be a primarily function of the state of polarization of the light rather than the color, or wavelength band, of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinafter, relationship between polarization states and color imbalance will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how reflectance for s- and p-polarized light depends on AOI for the conventional HR94 mirror. Graphs of reflectance of s-polarized light vs. wavelength are represented by dashed lines, and graphs of reflectance of p-polarized light&#x2014;by solid lines. There are twelve solid lines and twelve dashed lines, each line correspondent to a fixed AOI from an interval between 10 and 65 degrees with 5 degree steps. At AOI of 10 degrees, a dashed line for s-polarized light is close to a solid line for p-polarized light. Then, with increase of AOI, the reflectance of p-polarized light decreases, as shown by arrow <b>340</b>, while the reflectance of the s-polarized light increases, as shown by arrow <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, for the conventional mirror, the reflectance of the p-polarized light decreases with increasing angle of incidence, while the reflectance of the s-polarized light increases with increasing angle of incidence, with the change in the p-polarized reflectance being more pronounced. The average reflectance of the conventional HR94 mirror for various color bands is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Line <b>400</b> represents reflectance averaged over green (490-590 nm) color band, line <b>410</b>&#x2014;reflectance averaged over red (590-700 nm) color band, and line <b>420</b>&#x2014;over blue (420-490 nm) color band, versus angle of incidence for the appropriate polarizations. The average reflectance for the green band varies more than 7% while the average reflectance for the red and blue bands varies by about 2% over the range of AOI. This difference between the color channels in reflectance variation with angle causes the mixing between the red and blue channels (s-polarization) and the green channel (p-polarization) to vary with position, resulting in a non-uniform white color at the output.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, CIE 1931 color model quantifies white color imbalance across the conventional mirror <b>100</b>. For incident on the mirror nominal color-uniform white light comprising p-polarized green light and s-polarized red and blue light, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a CIE 1931 color plot for reflected light at nine footprint locations marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The nominal white point is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as well as a blackbody color line. Chromaticity coordinates of reflected light vary for the nine footprint locations as follows: x&#x2014;by about 0.001 and y&#x2014;by 0.012. This variation of y coordinate is perceived by a typical observer as an obvious change in color with position. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> illustrate the fact that the color imbalance across the conventional mirror is heightened by difference in angular dependency of reflectance for differently polarized light.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a result of discovering and attempting to understand the aforedescribed problem, an elegant and cost-effective solution has been found: properties of the coating layers of the mirror were chosen to keep reflectance of each color band fairly constant over the range of incidence angles, especially for the green light as more important to the human eye. The materials and thicknesses of the coating layers were selected to benefit from an effect of interference of p-polarized green light reflected from interfaces between the layers. Parameters of the layers were chosen so that said effect had an opposite angular dependence on AOI in comparison to reflectance of p-polarized light, thus providing at least partial compensation for decline of reflectance of the green p-polarized light with AOI.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A novel mirror in accordance with this invention has dielectric layers thicker than the conventional mirror. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show reflectance of the novel mirror for s- and p-polarized light, respectively, versus wavelength. Arrows <b>530</b> and <b>540</b> show change in reflectance of the s- and p-polarized light, respectively, when AOI varies from 10 to 65 degrees. The increase in thicknesses of the dielectric layers creates a reflectance dip for s-polarized light pointed to by arrow <b>550</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, absent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> related to the conventional mirror with the thinner layers. The layer thicknesses in the novel mirror are adjusted so that this undesirable dip occurs in the green band and does not affect reflectance of the green light, since it has no s-polarized component. The layer thicknesses are determined to keep the green p-polarized reflectance and the red and blue s-polarized reflectance fairly constant over the range of incidence angles.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once the white color balance problem was realized and it was discovered that intensity of the green light reflected from the mirror varies with angle beyond acceptable limits, the required properties of coating layers were determined by computer simulation of the projection system. A thin film software, similar to commercially available programs, such as TFCALC and OPTILAYER, was used for simulation. The program used the number of the layers, their materials, and the AOI range as input parameters to determine the required layer thicknesses in order to significantly lessen the variations in reflectance over the AOI range in comparison to a conventional, e.g. HR94, mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The aforedescribed computer simulation resulted in the novel mirror providing a more uniform white color with position than the conventional mirror. The novel mirror, according to the exemplary embodiment of the current invention, comprises a metal reflective layer and three optically transparent layers disposed over the metal reflective layer: a first layer, which is a layer of SiO2 about 92.5 nm thick, disposed over the metal reflective layer, a second layer, which is a layer of TiO2 about 52.1 nm thick, disposed over the first layer, and a third layer, which is a layer of SiO2 about 99.5 nm thick, disposed over the second layer. The metal reflective layer in this exemplary embodiment is a 60 nm&#x2014;thick aluminum layer; in other embodiments it can be made of other metals, e.g. silver or gold, and have different thickness without departing from the spirit of the current invention. The thickness of the optically transparent layers can have a random variation of 3% without the wavelength-averaged reflectance for the p-polarized green band changing by more than 0.25% (the wavelength-averaged reflectance for the red and blue bands change by less than 0.5% and 1%, respectively). Parameters of the mirror in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of current invention are provided below:</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, CIE 1931 color model quantifies white color balance across the mirror <b>100</b> in accordance with the current invention. For incident on the mirror nominal color-uniform white light comprising p-polarized green light and s-polarized red and blue light, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a CIE 1931 color plot for reflected light at nine footprint locations marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The output white color is significantly more uniform than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for the conventional mirror. Both, x and y, chromaticity coordinates of reflected light vary by about 0.003. This is a significant improvement over the variation of 0.012 in the y coordinate that occurs with the conventional mirror. Thus the coated mirror of the current invention significantly improves the white color uniformity across the viewing screen for a typical observer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Of course, numerous other embodiments may be envisioned without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Various numbers of coating layers and other materials can be used for computer simulation. For example, Ta2O5, Nb2O5, Al2O3, MgF2, and HfO2 can be used for coating layers. The reflective layer can be of a different thickness or made of a metal other than aluminum, e.g. silver or gold, without departing from the spirit of the current invention. Obviously, different number of layers and another combination of materials will result in different parameters of a mirror. Also, a mirror can be configured for another combination of color bands and polarization states, e.g. s-polarized green light and p-polarized red and blue light. Change in the AOI range may result in different parameters of the coating layers as well.</p>
