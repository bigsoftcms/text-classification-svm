<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-104611 filed on Apr. 5, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a temperature sensor and a method of manufacturing the temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,993 (corresponding to JP-A-2004-198394) discloses a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor includes a housing and a temperature sensor element. The temperature sensor element is electrically connected to a terminal through a lead. The temperature sensor further includes a buffering member between the lead and the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the temperature sensor is used for controlling an engine, response performance of the temperature sensor is required to be fast. In order to make the response performance of the temperature sensor to be fast, the lead is made thinner, for example. However, when the lead is made thinner and longer, the temperature sensor element may not solidly be supported by the lead, because the lead may be bent or broken by vibration applied from outside. Further, when the lead is made to be fitted to the housing, the lead may be bent or broken.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing and other problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a temperature sensor and a method of manufacturing the temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first example of the present invention, a temperature sensor includes a temperature sensor element, a housing and a supporting member. The temperature sensor element detects a temperature of media. The housing accommodates a terminal electrically connected to an outside circuit. The terminal is connected to the temperature sensor element through a lead having a strength insufficient for supporting the temperature sensor element. The supporting member accommodates the lead. The supporting member is made of a hot-melt adhesive, and connected to a part of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second example, a method of manufacturing a temperature sensor includes an arranging step and an injecting step. In the arranging step, a lead inserted into a tube is arranged on a mold. The lead electrically connects a temperature sensor element and a terminal, which is electrically connected to an outside circuit. In the injecting step, a hot-melt adhesive is injected into the mold so as to form a supporting member for covering the lead inserted into the tube, and supporting the temperature sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, response performance of the temperature sensor can be better, and the temperature sensor element can be solidly supported in the temperature sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a temperature sensor <b>20</b> is used in a temperature sensor integral-type pressure sensor device <b>1</b> for measuring a pressure and temperature of intake air in an intake manifold of a vehicle engine. The pressure sensor device <b>1</b> includes a pressure sensor <b>10</b> and the temperature sensor <b>20</b> in a housing constructed with a case <b>2</b> (first member) and a pipe <b>3</b> (second member). The case <b>2</b> and the pipe <b>3</b> are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The pressure sensor <b>10</b> includes a pressure sensor element for detecting pressure, and a signal processor integrated circuit (IC) for amplifying a signal output from the pressure sensor element. The pressure sensor <b>10</b> is supported by the case <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The case <b>2</b> is made of a heat resistant resin such as poly-butylene terephthalate (PBT) or poly-phenylene sulfide (PPS). A terminal <b>8</b> is inserted into the case <b>2</b>, and electrically connects the pressure sensor <b>10</b> and the temperature sensor <b>20</b> to an outside circuit such as an engine electric control unit (ECU).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The terminal <b>8</b> is electrically connected to a lead <b>22</b> in a connector <b>9</b>. The connector <b>9</b> has a potting of a sealing agent <b>11</b> in a state that the terminal <b>8</b> and the lead <b>22</b> are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The pipe <b>3</b> is made of a heat resistant resin such as PBT or PPS. The pipe <b>3</b> has a port <b>31</b> protruding to be connected to a detection port (not shown) provided in an air intake duct (not shown), for example. Media (fluid) to be detected passes through the port <b>31</b>. The pipe <b>3</b> has a pressure introduction passage, through which the pressure sensor <b>10</b> and the port <b>31</b> communicate with each other. The pressure introduction passage is separated into a first passage and a second passage by a separation board <b>31</b> of the pipe <b>3</b>. The separation board <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the pipe <b>3</b> extends in a direction of introducing media, for example. Media passes through the first passage toward a pressure-receiving face of the pressure sensor <b>10</b>. The temperature sensor <b>20</b> is disposed in the second passage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An O-ring <b>4</b> is disposed on a periphery of the pipe <b>3</b>. The pipe <b>3</b> is airtightly fitted to a sensor-mounting portion (not shown) through the O-ring <b>4</b>. The first and second passages are integrated in the pipe <b>3</b>, and communicate with the pressure sensor <b>10</b>. The separation board <b>3</b><i>a </i>is integrally formed with the pipe <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2A</figref>, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> includes a temperature sensor element <b>21</b>, the lead <b>22</b>, a protective (insulation) tube <b>23</b> and a supporting member <b>24</b>. The lead <b>22</b> electrically connects the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> and the terminal <b>8</b> (outside circuit). When the lead <b>22</b> is made thin, response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, experiments are performed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The temperature sensor element <b>21</b> (a thermistor <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> is at a first position P<b>1</b> in stationary air having temperature of 25&#xb0; C. Then, the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> is transferred to a second position P<b>2</b> as shown of a chained arrow direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The second position P<b>2</b> is located in air flow AF having temperature of 75&#xb0; C. and flowing as shown of a solid-line arrow direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a relationship between a time and a temperature of the thermistor <b>51</b>. A timing T in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> indicates timing for transferring the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> from the first position P<b>1</b> to the second position P<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a lead having diameter of 0.2 mm (&#x3c6;0.2 mm) has a better response performance, compared with a lead having diameter of 0.5 mm (&#x3c6;0.5 mm). Thus, when the lead <b>22</b> is made thin, that is when the lead <b>22</b> has a small diameter, the response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be better.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">However, if the lead having diameter of 0.2 mm is used as the lead <b>22</b>, the lead <b>22</b> may be broken or bent when vibration is applied to the lead <b>22</b> or when the lead <b>22</b> is fitted to the housing. Therefore, the lead <b>22</b> cannot sufficiently support the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Here, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> includes the supporting member <b>24</b>. The supporting member <b>24</b> sufficiently supports the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>, while the lead <b>22</b> has a strength insufficient for supporting the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>. Thus, the response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be made better, and the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> can be solidly supported by the supporting member <b>24</b>. The supporting member <b>24</b> is made of a hot-melt adhesive, e.g., polyurethane, polyester or polyamide. The supporting member <b>24</b> covers the lead <b>22</b> from adjacency of the connector <b>9</b> to adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>. The supporting member <b>24</b> and the case <b>2</b> are connected through a connection part <b>15</b>. A protrusion of the supporting member <b>24</b> and a recess of the case <b>2</b> are engaged with each other in the connection part <b>15</b>. Alternatively, a recess of the supporting member <b>24</b> and a protrusion of the case <b>2</b> may be engaged with each other in the connection part <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The supporting member <b>24</b> is mechanically connected to at least one of the case <b>2</b> and the pipe <b>3</b>. At this time, when the supporting member <b>24</b> is connected to the case <b>2</b>, the lead <b>22</b> is fixed to the case <b>2</b> through the supporting member <b>24</b>. Similarly, when the supporting member <b>24</b> is connected to the pipe <b>3</b>, the lead <b>22</b> is fixed to the pipe <b>3</b> through the supporting member <b>24</b>. Thus, the supporting member <b>24</b> supports the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A dashed line part of the supporting member <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>D and <b>2</b>E represents a cavity <b>24</b><i>a </i>(clearance) of the supporting member <b>24</b> in FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic side view of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> seen from a right side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>, the supporting member <b>24</b> has a protrusion at its upper end, and the protrusion of the supporting member <b>24</b> is mechanically connected to the case <b>2</b>, for example. The dashed line part is a trace made by a positioning jig <b>122</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the positioning jig <b>122</b> holds the lead <b>22</b> (tube <b>23</b>) in a hot-melt adhesive injection process to be described below. The cavity <b>24</b><i>a </i>is not filled with the hot-melt adhesive. Therefore, the lead <b>22</b> covered with the tube <b>23</b> is exposed from the supporting member <b>24</b> only at the cavity <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The supporting member <b>24</b> has the cavity <b>24</b><i>a </i>such that the lead <b>22</b> is arranged at a predetermined position of the supporting member <b>24</b>. The supporting member <b>24</b> may have plural cavities <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lead <b>22</b> is inserted into the tube <b>23</b> in order to reduce corrosion. As shown of a circle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, upper ends of the lead <b>22</b> and the tube <b>23</b> are exposed from the supporting member <b>24</b> so that the lead <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the terminal <b>8</b>. Therefore, when the potting of the sealing agent <b>11</b> is performed in the connector <b>9</b>, bubbles may be generated from a gap between the lead <b>22</b> and the tube <b>23</b>. A vacuum injection of the sealing agent <b>11</b> may be performed, in order to reduce the bubbles. However, the vacuum injection may not efficiently be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, as shown of a circle B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the tube <b>23</b> is not exposed at the upper end of the supporting member <b>24</b> adjacent to the connector <b>9</b>. When the tube <b>23</b> is disposed completely inside of the supporting member <b>24</b>, the vacuum injection of the sealing agent <b>11</b> is not needed. Thus, the bubbles in the sealing agent <b>11</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, as shown of a circle C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a terminal <b>81</b> may be provided in the supporting member <b>24</b>. An end of the terminal <b>81</b> is electrically connected to the lead <b>22</b> inside of the supporting member <b>24</b>, and another end of the terminal <b>81</b> is exposed from the supporting member <b>24</b> so as to be connected to the terminal <b>8</b> in the connector <b>9</b>. Thus, the tube <b>23</b> is not exposed at the upper end of the supporting member <b>24</b> adjacent to the connector <b>9</b>. Because the vacuum injection of the sealing agent <b>11</b> is not needed, the bubbles in the sealing agent <b>11</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> includes the thermistor <b>51</b>, an electrode <b>52</b>, a paste <b>53</b>, a first coating material <b>54</b> and a second coating material <b>55</b>. The thermistor <b>51</b> is a sensor chip for measuring a temperature, and made of metal, e.g., Co, Mn or Ni. The thermistor <b>51</b> is electrically connected to the lead <b>22</b> through the electrode <b>52</b> and the paste <b>53</b>. The thermistor <b>51</b> and a periphery of the thermistor <b>51</b> are covered and protected by the first coating material <b>54</b> made of glass, in a state that the electrode <b>52</b> and the lead <b>22</b> are electrically connected. The lead <b>22</b> is covered and protected by the protective (insulation) tube <b>23</b>. The second coating material <b>55</b> made of polyamide, for example, covers and protects the lead <b>22</b> between the tube <b>23</b> and the first coating material <b>54</b>, in order to reduce corrosion of the lead <b>22</b>. The lead <b>22</b> is connected to the terminal <b>8</b> by welding, for example, in the connector <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a pressure is applied to media in the pressure sensor device <b>1</b> in a direction of an outline arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pressure is transmitted to the pressure receiving face of the pressure sensor <b>10</b> disposed on the case <b>2</b> through the pressure introduction passage of the pipe <b>3</b>. Then, a diaphragm of the pressure sensor <b>10</b> is transformed in accordance with the pressure. A diffusion resistor (not shown) has a resistance variation value corresponding to the transformation of the diaphragm. The resistance variation value is output from a bridge circuit as a voltage, and amplified in a signal processor. Thereafter, the amplified result is output into the outside circuit through the terminal <b>8</b>. Further, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> detects a temperature of media adjacent to the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>. The detected temperature signal is output into the outside circuit through the terminal <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, a method of manufacturing the temperature sensor <b>20</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5C</figref>. First, a method of molding the supporting member <b>24</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The supporting member <b>24</b> is formed by injecting the hot-melt adhesive into a mold including a first mold <b>110</b> and a second mold <b>120</b>. The first mold <b>110</b> has a cut preventing portion <b>111</b> for preventing the tube <b>23</b> from being cut, and lead holders <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>are provided in the cut preventing portion <b>111</b>. The second mold <b>120</b> has a cut preventing portion <b>121</b> for preventing the tube <b>23</b> from being cut, and lead holders <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b </i>are provided in the cut preventing portion <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the supporting member <b>24</b> is molded with a comparison mold not having the cut preventing portions <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>, a lead covered with a tube is arranged on a positioning jig (lead holder), and a gap between the lead holder and the tube is cleared. However, when the tube is tightened by the comparison mold, the tube may be cut at the lead holder.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In contrast, in this embodiment, the first mold <b>110</b> has the cut preventing portion <b>111</b> made of a soft material such as rubber, and the lead holders <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>are provided in the cut preventing portion <b>111</b>. The second mold <b>120</b> has the cut preventing portion <b>121</b> made of the soft material such as rubber, and the lead holders <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b </i>are provided in the cut preventing portion <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to mold the supporting member <b>24</b>, the lead <b>22</b> covered with the tube <b>23</b> is arranged on the lead holders <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b</i>, and the lead <b>22</b> is arranged on the positioning jig <b>122</b>. Then, the hot-melt adhesive is injected and molded in a cavity between the first mold <b>110</b> and the second mold <b>120</b> in the hot-melt adhesive injection process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Due to the hot-melt adhesive injection process, the hot-melt adhesive can be injected into the cavity of the mold with a low injection pressure. At this time, the hot-melt adhesive is melted and has a low viscosity. An ordinary injection process has an injection pressure of about 1000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, the hot-melt adhesive injection process in this embodiment has the injection pressure of about 10 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, stress applied to the lead <b>22</b> can be reduced when the hot-melt adhesive is injected into the cavity of this mold. Thus, the lead <b>22</b> is not broken or bent, while the lead <b>22</b> is thin. Even if a gap is provided between the lead holder <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the tube <b>23</b>, the gap can be filled with the hot-melt adhesive in the hot-melt adhesive injection process. Thus, accuracy for molding the supporting member <b>24</b> can be improved. Further, the hot-melt adhesive injection process may be easily automated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, a method of mechanically connecting the temperature sensor <b>20</b> to the pipe <b>3</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the lead <b>22</b> is covered with the supporting member <b>24</b>, and the supporting member <b>24</b> is positioned to be protruded from an end of an opening of the pipe <b>3</b>. The opening of the pipe <b>3</b> is made between the pipe <b>3</b> and the separation board <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the pipe <b>3</b>. At this time, a clearance necessary for assembling the supporting member <b>24</b> and the pipe <b>3</b> is provided between the supporting member <b>24</b> and the pipe <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a heat pin <b>210</b> is arranged on the supporting member <b>24</b> protruding from the end of the opening of the pipe <b>3</b> so as to correspond to a position of the opening of the pipe <b>3</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the supporting member <b>24</b> is pressed into the opening of the pipe <b>3</b> and heated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because the supporting member <b>24</b> is made of the hot-melt adhesive, the heat pin <b>210</b> can easily transform the supporting member <b>24</b>. Thus, when the supporting member <b>24</b> is pressed and heated, the transformed hot-melt adhesive (supporting member <b>24</b>) can be in an intimate contact with the pipe <b>3</b>. Thus, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> is mechanically connected to the pipe <b>3</b>. Therefore, the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> can be solidly supported by the supporting member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, if the clearance necessary for assembling the supporting member <b>24</b> and the pipe <b>3</b> is left in an comparison example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the supporting member <b>24</b> may be displaced by a vibration V having acceleration surpassing a strength of the supporting member <b>24</b>. Then, the pipe <b>3</b> and the supporting member <b>24</b> may interfere with each other, and a wear <b>24</b><i>b </i>may be generated in the supporting member <b>24</b>. However, in this embodiment, the clearance necessary for assembling the supporting member <b>24</b> and the pipe <b>3</b> is not left, after the supporting member <b>24</b> is pressed into the opening of the pipe <b>3</b>. Therefore, the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> can be solidly supported by the supporting member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, the supporting member <b>24</b> is mechanically pressed into the opening of the pipe <b>3</b>. Alternatively, the supporting member <b>24</b> may be mechanically connected to the case <b>2</b> by pressing and heating. That is, the supporting member <b>24</b> is mechanically connected at least one of the case <b>2</b> and the pipe <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The supporting member <b>24</b> has a straight shape in this embodiment. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the supporting member <b>24</b> is made gradually thinner toward the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>. Thereby, a thermal mass absorbing and holding heat can be easily reduced. That is, heat can be easily radiated in adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>. Thus, the response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the lead <b>22</b> may have a first thickness (shape) in adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> and a second thickness (shape) in adjacency of the terminal <b>8</b>. The first shape is thinner (smaller) than the second shape. Thus, the response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be improved, because the thermal mass can be easily reduced in adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the supporting member <b>24</b> may have a first thickness (shape) in adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b> and a second thickness (shape) in adjacency of the terminal <b>8</b>. The first shape is thinner (smaller) than the second shape. Thus, the response performance of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> can be improved, because the thermal mass can be easily reduced in adjacency of the temperature sensor element <b>21</b>.</p>
