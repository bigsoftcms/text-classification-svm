<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a tape measure comprising a housing into which a measuring tape can be wound, or, as the case may be, out of which it can be drawn, the tape extending from a drum rotationally supported in the housing, the drum being rotatable around an element like a handle, which at least in sections passes through a first external lateral surface of the housing, and which proceeds from a support or comprises it.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A tape measure with a frame is known from DE-U-297 00 227, which is taken up by a winding drum, which can be operated by means of a crank as a handle, which crank extends outside the frame. A tape measure known from DE-C-34 04 629 discloses a housing in which a rotating axis formed in one piece with a crank handle is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Similar tape measures with hand-operated winding mechanisms are normally used for tape measures that are more than 10 meters in length and have a flat tape cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">We also know of tape measures that have a spring-operated winding mechanism (EP-A-1 074 818). In that case, the measuring tape has an arched cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tape measures of this type, also called pocket tape measures, have a housing, also called a capsule, which is configured in such a way that the length of the base, which is provided with measuring units, can also be used for a so-called internal measurement between two defining surfaces. The zero-point of the tape measure abuts on one defining surface. The external edge of the housing, or as the case may be, the capsule, abuts on the opposite defining surface. The measurement read from the tape measure with the addition of the known length of the base of the housing makes up the &#x201c;internal measurement.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tape measures with hand-operated winding mechanisms do not offer the possibility of taking an internal measurement. In addition, the housings or capsules of long tape measures are fundamentally designed according to ergonomic considerations, without the possibility of a stop-situation comparable to that of a pocket tape measure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The housing, or as the case may be, the capsules of pocket tape measures are often configured in a way that enables corner-stop positions from any orientation. This requires that the lateral surfaces run coplanar to each other. The coplanar aspect is not present in the housings of tape measures with hand-operated winding mechanism with ergonomically shaped housings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE-C-1 194 159 relates to a tape measure that can be wound up inside a housing and which is operated using a crank. The crank originates from a support embedded in the housing, which protrudes laterally outside the wall of the tape-measure housing by means of a circumferential flange.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A winding tape measure according to DE-U-1 944 081 comprises a crank to wind up the tape measure. The crank emerges from a support that protrudes above the external surface of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of a tape measure according to DE-U-1 992 258, a crank that runs along the outside of the tape measure housing is used to wind up the measuring tape.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A measuring tape according to DE-B-96 14 269 can be rolled up by means of a crank that runs outside the housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is based on the task of further developing a tape measure with a hand-operated winding mechanism to include the measuring advantages of pocket tape measures, so that internal measurements and measurements of corner stop positions can be undertaken from any orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to accomplish this task, the invention essentially provides for the element to be slideably positioned along the drum axis inside the housing, for the element as well as its support in a first position (measuring position) to merge flush with the outer lateral surface or run offset thereto and protrude in a second position (use position), at least in part, above the first external lateral surface, in order to engage the element. The element, like the handle, can be locked inside the housing in the first and/or second position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The element, like the handle and the support, form a unit, wherein the outside of the support does not protrude above the corresponding outside surface of the housing in the measuring position of the tape measure. In other words, the element with the support can be positioned in the measuring position in such a way that the outside of the housing is completely clear, that is, sections of the support and the element do not protrude. As a result, in the measuring position, no section of the element, including its receiver, or as the case may be, its support, protrudes above the outer surface of the housing. The element includes a holder such as a crank element, by means of which the element can be rotated. The holder, or as the case may be, the crank element, are pivotably attached to the support.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is provided in particular that the housing has a flat cuboid geometry with a base surface extending in the direction in which the measuring tape is extracted, vertical to which extend the first outer lateral surface and a second outer lateral surface that runs parallel thereto, and that between the outer lateral surfaces a peripheral surface that merges with the base surface extends, a first section of the peripheral surface proceeding from a first end of the base surface and having or defining a slot extending along the base surface, through which the measuring tape passes, and a second section proceeding from another end of the base surface and extending vertical thereto. The base surface, the first and second outer surfaces and the peripheral surface are outer surfaces of a base wall, first and second outer lateral walls, and a peripheral wall that form the housing. The housing also preferably has two half-shells, so that the peripheral and base wall is divided into two parts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further development of the invention provides for the handle to comprise a cup-shaped base section, which has a first hollow cylinder section running along the inside of the housing, which is the drum onto which the measuring tape is wound. The first hollow cylinder extends from a floor wall of the base section, which wall is aligned parallel or substantially parallel to the first outer lateral surface and has a pivotable holder element, which can preferably be completely embedded in the floor wall or can be disposed to project above it. The holder element is preferably pivotable around an axis that runs vertical to the rotating axis of the drum. The floor wall, or as the case may be, the same and the first hollow cylinder section therefore form the support.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, there is a lug that extends from the floor wall in the direction of the second outside lateral wall, which can be acted upon by a force via a through-hole in the second outside lateral wall in order to effect axial displacement of the base section. The through-hole is preferably covered by an elastic element such as a membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further development of the invention provides for the through-hole to be surrounded by a circular disc element, which is aligned parallel or substantially parallel to the outer surface of the second lateral wall, or as the case may be, the outer surface thereof; a second hollow-cylinder section extends from the disc plate, this section being surrounded by the first hollow-cylinder section of the handle and displaceable along it.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first and second hollow cylinder sections therefore form a crank-drum which has a divided, or as the case may be, telescoped shape, the part of which that has the holder element being arranged that it can be optionally completely embedded in the housing or protrude in part from the same.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first position can be termed the parking or use position, as the measuring tape is not rolled up, the measuring tape actually being used for measuring. The second position can be called the &#x201c;raised handle or use position,&#x201d; in which the handle is in the optimum position for function.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to unequivocally position the handle in both the use and measuring positions, the handle can be locked in each position. For this purpose, at least one locking element that can be acted on by a force and runs perpendicular to the drum axis can extend from the second hollow cylinder section, to which element locking receivers in the first hollow-cylinder section are assigned, whose axial intervals correspond to the intervals between the use and measuring positions of the handle. It is particularly provided that the locking element be designed as a spring pre-stressed sphere element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to adjust the handle, it is necessary only that pressure can be exerted on the lug that extends from the floor wall of the handle, which can also be termed the crank mandrel, through the through-hole present in the second lateral wall, in order to displace the handle from the first locked position (parking or measuring position) into the raised handle or use position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This invention proposes a tape measure comprising a housing into which a measuring tape can be rolled up, or as the case may be, from which a measuring tape can be pulled out, the tape extending from a drum disposed rotatably in the housing, it being possible to rotate the drum using a holder element, which extends from a handle and at least in part passes through a first outer lateral surface of the housing and originates from a support. In order to perform inside measurements and measurements in corner-stop positions from any orientation without difficulty, there is provision for the handle to be arranged slideably along the drum axis inside the housing, for the handle and the support to merge flush with the outer lateral surface in a first position (measuring position) or to run offset thereto, and in a second position (use position) to protrude at least in part above the first outer lateral surface in order to engage the element.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The figures present a schematic diagram of a housing <b>12</b>, which can also be called a capsule, of a tape measure <b>10</b> with a flat tape cross-section, which is suitable for internal measurements, or as the case may be, corner-stop measurements. This normally involves measuring tapes with a length of more than 10 meters, the measuring tape having a level cross-section, meaning not arched, as is usual in the case of pocket tape measures with spring-driven winding mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing <b>12</b> of the tape measure <b>10</b>, which consists of two half-shells <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, has a flat cuboid geometry with a first lateral wall <b>14</b> forming the front and a lateral wall <b>16</b> extending parallel thereto and forming the second lateral wall <b>16</b>. The outer surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the lateral walls <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> run coplanar to each other. Between the outer surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, and vertical thereto, extends a base surface <b>22</b>, which is the outer surface of a base wall <b>23</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. Originating in the base wall <b>23</b>, and extending between the outer surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the lateral walls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, a peripheral wall <b>24</b>, which in part describes a segment of a circle (Area <b>26</b>), which extends opposite to a slot S that runs in the area of the base surface <b>22</b>, through which slot the measuring tape, which is not depicted in the drawing, can be pulled by means of a loop <b>28</b> out of the housing <b>12</b>, or as the case may be, retracted into it.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The base wall <b>23</b> and the peripheral wall <b>24</b> form a unit, however they are separated at a plane extending parallel to the lateral wall <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and can be joined together. The segments of the base and peripheral walls <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> consequently form the rims of the housing half-shells <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, the peripheral wall <b>24</b> can in parts have a ridge <b>30</b>, which facilitates handling of the tape measure <b>10</b>, said ridge merging across the steps <b>31</b>, <b>35</b> into the lateral walls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embedded in the first lateral wall <b>14</b>, meaning the front of the housing <b>12</b>, is an element configured as a handle <b>32</b>, arranged in an axially displaceable manner, as will be explained in detail below. The measuring tape can be wound up using this element, meaning the handle <b>32</b>. In order to press the handle <b>32</b> out of the housing <b>12</b> so that it protrudes above the front, meaning the first lateral wall <b>14</b>, a recess or aperture <b>33</b> is provided in the back, meaning the second lateral wall <b>20</b>. Via the aperture <b>33</b>, a force can act on the handle <b>32</b> in order to axially displace it.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the position with the handle <b>32</b> inside the housing <b>12</b>, which is also called the parking or measurement position, the handle <b>32</b> is lowered into the housing <b>12</b> in such a way that the handle <b>32</b> does not protrude above the outer surface <b>18</b> of the first lateral wall <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">This provides clear coplanar outer surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> on the front and back sides of the housing <b>12</b>, so that the tape measure is suitable for corner-stops from any orientation. There is also the possibility of using the tape measure <b>10</b> for internal measurements. In order to do this, the section <b>36</b> of the peripheral wall <b>24</b>, which section originates from the base surface <b>22</b> and is opposite the slot through which the measuring tape passes, extends perpendicular to the base <b>22</b>. Consequently, the outer edge <b>38</b> of the housing <b>12</b> can be used as the stop position for measurement, provided that the length of the base surface <b>12</b> is dimensioned accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> represent the tape measure <b>10</b> with the handle <b>32</b> in the so-called use position, in which the handle <b>32</b> protrudes out of the housing <b>12</b>, meaning to some distance above the first lateral wall <b>14</b>, or as the case may be, the front of the housing <b>12</b>, and thereby above the outer surface <b>18</b>, so that a pivotable crank handle <b>40</b> can be gripped, in order to wind up the measuring tape, which is not shown. Prior to this, the handle <b>32</b> must be pressed out of the housing <b>12</b>. This is indicated purely in principle by the arrow <b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In order to embed the handle <b>32</b> completely in the housing <b>12</b>, so that the coplanar outer surfaces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> of the front and back sides of the housing <b>12</b> are freely accessible, making the housing <b>12</b> suitable for corner-stops from any orientation, or in order to allow the handle to protrude from the housing <b>12</b>, the designs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> can be chosen, which are considered preferred. Other embodiments are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The design shown here uses a divided crank drum, which is made of a section of the handle <b>32</b> and a section of the back of the second lateral wall <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show, the handle <b>32</b> has a cup-shaped base section <b>44</b>, which has a floor wall <b>46</b> and a first hollow cylinder section <b>48</b>, onto which the measuring tape can wound and which extends vertically or substantially vertically to the floor wall and in the direction of the back or second lateral wall <b>16</b>. The base section <b>44</b>, or as the case may be, the floor wall <b>46</b>, form the support for the crank holder.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first hollow cylinder section <b>48</b>, as the first section of the drum, encloses a second hollow cylinder section <b>50</b> as the second section of the drum and can be locked thereto. The second hollow cylinder section <b>50</b> merges into a ring disc element <b>52</b> along the back or second lateral wall <b>16</b>, but the ring disc element does not protrude above the outer surface <b>20</b> of the wall and is pivotably mounted on the back.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Spring pre-stressed locking elements <b>54</b> extend from the second hollow cylinder section <b>50</b>, by means of which elements the first hollow cylinder section <b>48</b> can be locked in the measuring or parking position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and in the use position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), in which the handle <b>32</b> protrudes above the outer surface <b>16</b> of the front or the first lateral wall <b>14</b>. For this purpose, the first hollow cylinder section <b>48</b> has corresponding slots <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, the axial intervals between them corresponding to the intervals between the measuring and use positions of the handle <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Extending from the floor wall <b>46</b> of the handle <b>32</b> in the direction of the aperture <b>33</b> of the rear lateral wall <b>14</b> is a lug <b>58</b> that can be termed a crank or ejector mandrel, by means of which the handle <b>32</b> can be moved from the measuring or parking position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) into the use position, in which the handle <b>32</b> protrudes above the outer surface <b>16</b> of the front lateral wall <b>14</b>. In order to do this, the proper pressure must be exerted via the aperture <b>33</b>. The aperture <b>33</b> can be covered by a rubber element such as a membrane <b>34</b>, which can be fixed by the second hollow cylinder section <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">There is also the possibility of a disk element extending from the mandrel <b>58</b>, which element closes the aperture <b>33</b> in the parking position, and which can be pressed into the housing <b>12</b> by the exertion of force, in order to move the handle <b>32</b> into the use position. A rigid disc element that is accessible via the aperture <b>33</b>, without the necessity of an integral design with the lug or mandrel <b>58</b>, can also be used. In this case, the disc element must be operated separately.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An edge section <b>60</b> with an L-shape in sectional representation projects from the floor wall <b>44</b> of the handle <b>32</b> into the inside of the housing <b>12</b>, which section in the use position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) rests against the first lateral wall <b>18</b> or front on the inside. This provides the drum comprised of the hollow cylinder sections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> with a mounting in an axial direction, as the ring disc plate element <b>52</b>, which also has an L-shaped edge section <b>62</b>, rests on a geometrically adapted step <b>64</b> of the second lateral wall <b>16</b>. The step <b>64</b> defines a central opening in the second lateral wall <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref> illustrate that the handle <b>32</b> and its receiver do not project above, or as the case may be, protrude in any way above the lateral outer surface <b>18</b> of the housing <b>12</b> when the measuring tape is not rolled up, that is, when the tape measure is supposed to be used for measuring.</p>
