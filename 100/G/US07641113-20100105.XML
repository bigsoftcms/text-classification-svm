<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/512,290 titled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Money Sharing,&#x201d; filed Oct. 17, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to financial services, and more particularly to systems and methods for generating revenue from banking transactions using a stored-value card.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Customers use automatic teller machines (ATMs) to conduct banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transfers between traditional bank accounts. ATMs require ATM/debit cards with associated Personal Identification Number (PIN). Some ATMs charge service fees for withdrawals. Some service fees are calculated from increased exchange rates for foreign currency conversions. One problem with ATM/debit cards is that a bank customer must physically go to a branch of a bank to set up a traditional bank account because ATM/debit cards have a traditional bank account, such as a demand deposit account (DDA), associated with it. The bank typically checks the customer's identity based on their driver's license or other documentation and collects personal information such as address, date of birth, and Social Security number. Banks need to verify identification to prevent fraud and/or improve security for the customer's banking transactions. Furthermore, there may be government regulations that require proof of identity before using bank accounts to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and funding of terrorist activities.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem is that the funds deposited into an ATM machine are not immediately available for withdrawal. For example, if a customer deposits cash or a check in a deposit envelope, the deposited amount is not immediately available until a bank employee services the ATM machine to collect and process the deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Customers have also used credit cards for banking transactions. One problem with credit cards is that a person usually needs to have good credit to have a credit line issued for a credit card. Another problem is that credit cards can take weeks to issue from a bank. After receiving and approving a credit card application, the credit card is then mailed to the person's address.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem relates to a large population of US residents (by some estimates as much as 50 million) that are poorly served by the banking system&#x2014;the &#x201c;under-banked&#x201d; or the &#x201c;unbanked&#x201d;. This population is generally excluded from traditional banking products (checking accounts, credit cards, debit cards) or moves in and out of eligibility for them&#x2014;as banks offering them generally require good credit and/or unreasonably large security deposits in order to obtain these services. People may be excluded for any number of reasons such as having unfortunate circumstances like a divorce or serious medical problem adversely impact their credit standing, or such as making mistakes with their credit coming out of college leading to poor credit or a bankruptcy, or such as having no established credit history because they are a recent immigrant or someone who chooses to conduct their financial affairs primarily with cash. The reason banks generally exclude these groups of people from their service offerings is the cost and risk associated with the products, particularly credit cards and checking accounts. Therefore, these people may be excluded from certain financial transactions that require credit cards or debit cards. In one example, a person without a credit card cannot make purchases over the Internet, buy products from a catalogue, reserve a hotel room or rental car, purchase airline tickets, or even rent a movie, which may require a credit card. Thus, there is a need to provide convenient, cost-effective, lower risk financial services to this population.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one prior art solution provided by 7-Eleven, a VCOM kiosk provides banking transactions such as money transfer, printing checks, and check cashing based on a deposited amount. However, a customer must also interact with a cashier in addition to the VCOM kiosk to perform the banking transactions. Also, the card associated with the VCOM kiosk is only used for identification purposes. Other kiosks manufactured by Blackstone issue cards, but the cards are calling cards.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Stored-value cards typically have been used for providing payment for goods or services after a user has deposited money into the stored-value card. For example, stored-value cards have been used as gift cards and as cards that provide payment for coffee or copies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention addresses the above problems by providing systems and methods for banking transactions that generates revenue and that use a kiosk to perform financial services. The kiosk determines a stored-value account related to a stored-value card for a user of the kiosk. The kiosk performs a banking transaction using the stored-value account. The kiosk then determines a service fee for the banking transaction. The kiosk deducts the service fee from the stored-value account or a value of the banking transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the service fee is a flat fee. In some embodiments, the service fee is based on a calculation that is a percentage of the value of the banking transaction. In some embodiments, the service fee is based on a calculation that uses an exchange rate for a foreign currency conversion. In some embodiments, the kiosk dispenses the stored-value card.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These systems and methods advantageously generate revenue from providing banking transactions using unattended kiosks and stored-value cards. These systems and methods generate revenue by charging service fees from the provision of banking transactions. Users can conduct banking transactions without having to visit a branch of a bank. Furthermore, users can also conveniently perform banking transactions using stored-value cards and stored-value accounts without setting up and maintaining a traditional bank account. A banking transaction is any financial dealing or action related to account activity such as deposits, withdrawals, purchases, transfers, account inquiries, and printing of financial instruments. In some embodiments, users will not be required to visit a branch office of a bank to set up a traditional bank account before being issued a stored-value card for banking transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, another advantage is that the user can conduct banking transactions using stored-value cards without being subject to credit checks, extensive background checks, or large deposit requirements. Also, the costs of providing banking transactions are reduced because of the use of an unattended kiosk. In some cases, by requiring cash payment, the risks that banks take in providing banking transaction using stored-value cards are reduced, and the amount deposited in the stored-value account may be available in real-time for other banking transactions. Thus, in some embodiments, banks can provide a broad array of services for banking transactions using stored-value cards to the unbanked population because of the cost-effectiveness and the reduced risks.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present inventions provide systems and methods for generating revenue from banking transactions using a stored-value card. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various features disclosed in connection with the embodiments may be used either individually or jointly. It is to be appreciated that while the present inventions have been described with reference to preferred implementations, those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present inventions may be beneficially utilized in any number of environments and implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The inventions have been described below with reference to specific embodiments. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made and other embodiments can be used without departing from the broader scope of the inventions. Therefore, these and other variations upon the specific embodiments are intended to be covered by the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The systems and methods that generate revenue from banking transactions use a kiosk to perform financial services. The kiosk determines a stored-value account related to a stored-value card for a user of the kiosk. The kiosk then performs a banking transaction using the stored-value account. The kiosk determines a service fee for the banking transaction. The kiosk then deducts the service fee from the stored-value account or a value of the banking transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A stored-value account is monetary value associated with a card that does not require a credit line or a traditional bank account, such as a demand deposit account (&#x201c;DDA&#x201d;) or brokerage account. A stored-value card is any card that is associated with a stored-value account. A banking transaction is any financial dealing or action related to account activity such as deposits, withdrawals, purchases, transfers, account inquiries, and printing of financial instruments. A service fee is any amount charged to a user for a banking transaction. In some embodiments, the service fee is a flat fee. In other embodiments, the service fee is based on a calculation of the banking transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">These systems and methods advantageously generate revenue from providing banking transactions using unattended kiosks and stored-value cards. These systems and methods generate revenue by charging service fees from the provision of banking transactions. Users can conduct banking transactions without having to visit a branch of a bank. Furthermore, users can also conveniently perform banking transactions using stored-value cards and stored-value accounts without setting up and maintaining a traditional bank account. A banking transaction is any financial dealing or action related to account activity such as deposits, withdrawals, purchases, transfers, account inquiries, and printing of financial instruments. In some embodiments, users will not be required to visit a branch office of a bank to set up a traditional bank account before being issued a stored-value card for banking transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, another advantage is that the user can conduct banking transactions using stored-value cards without being subject to credit checks, extensive background checks, or large deposit requirements. Also, the costs of providing banking transactions are reduced because of the use of an unattended kiosk. In some cases, by requiring cash payment, the risks that banks take in providing banking transaction using stored-value cards are reduced, and the amount deposited in the stored-value account may be available in real-time for other banking transactions. Thus, in some embodiments, banks can provide a broad array of services for banking transactions using stored-value cards to the unbanked population because of the cost-effectiveness and the reduced risks.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The master stored-value account <b>310</b> can be a signature- and PIN-based stored-value account. The master stored-value account <b>310</b> can be reloaded with funds and used anywhere in the world that a bank card association network (such as Visa/Mastercard) is accepted. In some embodiments, the master stored-value account <b>310</b> includes phone card capability, the capability to issue money orders, and the ability to move money into a money-sharing sub-account. The master stored-value account <b>310</b> allows movement of some or all of the funds present in the master stored-value account <b>310</b> into money sharing sub-accounts. These funds can be accessed by taking a cash advance from the master stored-value account <b>310</b> at ATMs and banks worldwide, or by using the specially designed money-share sister card to affect the cash advance at ATMs globally.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the sister card for sub-accounts is a PIN-required ATM-accessed stored-value card. In other embodiments, the sub-accounts may be for utility bills, school tuition, gift cards, groceries, and other miscellaneous stored-value card programs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a flow chart for the kiosk in dispensing a new stored-value card in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> begins in step <b>400</b>. In step <b>402</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks if a stored-value card was inserted or a new stored-value account was requested by the user. If a stored-value card was inserted, the process for dispensing a new stored-value card ends in step <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If a new stored-value account was requested, the kiosk <b>100</b> receives a service fee for the new account in step <b>404</b>. The payment for the service fee may be made by cash, check, credit, debit, or another stored-value card. The kiosk <b>100</b> may receive the payment through either a check reader <b>132</b>, the money validation device <b>136</b>, or any other device in the monetary transaction devices <b>130</b> that accepts payment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>406</b>, the processor <b>150</b> determines the type of card to issue. In some embodiments, there may be different types of stored-value cards to issue. In step <b>408</b>, the biometric capture system <b>180</b> captures biometric data by photo, voice sample, fingerprint, and/or retina scan of the user of the kiosk <b>100</b>. The process of capturing the biometric data of a user of the kiosk is described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/966,299 entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Biometric Identification and Verification of a User of a Kiosk&#x201d; filed on Oct. 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>410</b>, the kiosk <b>100</b> scans documents for personal information. In some embodiments, the kiosk <b>100</b> scans the documents for personal information through the card reader <b>120</b>. Some examples of documents that can be scanned are Matricula Consular cards and driver's licenses. In step <b>412</b>, the kiosk <b>100</b> receives personal information based on user input. The kiosk <b>100</b> may receive personal information from the audio interface <b>112</b>, the video interface <b>114</b>, the keypad <b>118</b>, the card reader <b>120</b>, or the biometric capture system <b>180</b>. Alternative embodiments may use any one or combination of steps <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, and <b>410</b> to capture identification and personal information.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>414</b>, the processor <b>150</b> then generates a personal identification record based on the identification imprint and the personal information. In one embodiment, the personal identification record includes name, local address, place and date of birth, digital photo, digital fingerprint, digital voice print, digital photo of ID e.g. driver's license, Social Security number, tax ID number, and Matricula Consular card number. In some embodiments, the card transaction processing system <b>220</b> generates the personal identification record based on the identification imprint and the personal information.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step <b>416</b>, the kiosk <b>100</b> displays the personal identification record using the video interface <b>114</b> or the audio interface <b>112</b> for user verification. In step <b>418</b>, the processor <b>150</b> validates the personal identification record against the government database <b>230</b>. In other embodiments, the card transaction processing system <b>220</b> or the member bank system <b>240</b> validates the personal identification record against the government database <b>230</b>. This validation process is described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/966,496 entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Identifying and Verifying a User of a Kiosk Using an External Verification System&#x201d; filed on Oct. 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step <b>420</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the personal identification record is valid. If invalid, the process ends in step <b>426</b>. If valid, the processor <b>150</b> assigns a stored-value account to the stored-value card in step <b>422</b>. In other embodiments, the stored-value account is preassigned to the stored-value card. In some embodiments, the card transaction processing system <b>220</b> assigns a stored-value account to the stored-value card. In step <b>424</b>, the kiosk <b>100</b> dispenses a new stored-value card, card voucher, and/or printed materials through the dispenser system <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> ends in step <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flow chart for a kiosk for banking transactions in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> begins in step <b>500</b>. In step <b>502</b>, the card reader <b>120</b> receives card information from the stored-value card. In step <b>504</b>, the keypad <b>118</b> or the video interface <b>114</b> receives the PIN number from the user of the kiosk <b>100</b>. In step <b>506</b>, the processor <b>150</b> then checks whether the card information and the PIN number are valid. If the card information and the PIN number are invalid, the process ends in step <b>542</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step <b>508</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has selected to view the balance of their stored-value account. If the user has not selected to view their balance, the process continues to step <b>512</b>. If the user has selected to view their balance, the video interface <b>114</b> displays the balance or the printer <b>116</b> prints out the balance for the stored-value account in step <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the kiosk <b>100</b> provides a card statement, account activity (i.e. last 5 transactions), recent transactions, and/or balances. In some embodiments, the kiosk <b>100</b> provides statement information that is required by government regulations. The statement information from the kiosk <b>100</b> may provide improved customer service for users that are underbanked or unbanked who may not receive mail or may not have access to the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>512</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has selected to deposit money into their stored-value account. If the user has not selected to deposit, the process continues to step <b>522</b>. If the user has selected to deposit, the kiosk <b>100</b> receives monetary input for the stored-value account in step <b>514</b>. The monetary input may be by cash, check, credit, debit, or another stored-value card. The kiosk <b>100</b> may receive the monetary input through either the check reader <b>132</b>, the money validation device <b>136</b>, or any other device in the monetary transaction devices <b>130</b> that accepts the monetary input. In step <b>516</b>, the kiosk <b>100</b> validates the monetary input.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step <b>518</b>, the processor <b>150</b> determines a service fee for the deposit. In some embodiments, the card transaction processing system <b>220</b> determines the service fee. In some embodiments, the service fee is a flat fee for any deposit. In other embodiments, the service fee is based on a calculation of the amount deposited. For example, the service fee may be a percentage of the amount deposited. In another example, the service fee may be $2.00 for each increment of $100.00 deposited. There are numerous variations in how a service fee for a banking transaction may be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the kiosk <b>100</b> receives a separate payment for the service fee. The payment for the service fee may be made by cash, check, credit, debit, or another stored-value card. The kiosk <b>100</b> may receive the payment through either the check reader <b>132</b>, the money validation device <b>136</b>, or any other device in the monetary transaction devices <b>130</b> that accepts payment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the service fee is deducted from the amount deposited or deducted from the stored-value account. In step <b>520</b>, the processor <b>150</b> generates the account entry for the monetary input deposited to the stored-value account and the service fee. In some embodiments, the monetary input deposited is immediately available in the stored-value account, which may result in instantaneous money sharing among multiple users.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>522</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has selected to withdraw money from their stored-value account. If the user has not selected to withdraw, the process continues to step <b>538</b>. If the user has selected to withdraw, the processor <b>150</b> determines a service fee for the withdrawal in step <b>524</b>. In some embodiments, the card transaction processing system <b>220</b> determines the service fee. In some embodiments, the service fee is a flat fee for any withdrawal. For example, there may be a flat fee charge of $0.55 for a money order printed. In other embodiments, the service fee is based on a calculation of the amount withdrawn. In one example, the service fee is an increase in an exchange rate for foreign currency conversion if the amount withdrawn and the stored-value account are in different currencies.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>526</b>, the video interface <b>114</b> displays the service fee for the user's acceptance. In step <b>528</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has accepted the service fee via the audio interface <b>112</b>, the video interface <b>114</b>, or the keypad <b>118</b>. If the user has not accepted, the process continues to step <b>538</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the user has accepted, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has selected to withdraw by printing a check or money order in step <b>530</b>. If the user has selected to print a check or money order, the check printer <b>134</b> prints the check or money order in step <b>532</b>. In some embodiments, the checks have a preprinted amount that can be validated in real time to check if the funds are available in the stored-value account or that the funds have been deposited and validated in the kiosk <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the user of the kiosk <b>100</b> can add the payee and the signature for the check. In some embodiments, the check amount is instantaneously debited from the stored-value account to allow &#x201c;pre-paid&#x201d; checks as opposed to traditional &#x201c;post-paid&#x201d; checks. If the user has not selected to print a check or money order, the kiosk <b>100</b> disperses cash in step <b>534</b>. In step <b>536</b>, the processor <b>150</b> generates an account entry for the service fee and the monetary output withdrawn from the stored-value account.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>538</b>, the processor <b>150</b> checks whether the user has selected to transfer money from the stored-value account to another account. Some examples of other accounts are described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. If the user has not selected to transfer, the process ends in step <b>542</b>. If the user has selected to transfer, the processor <b>150</b> generates account entries to transfer the monetary output from the stored-value account in step <b>540</b>. In some embodiments, a service fee may be charged for the transfer of money between accounts. In some embodiments, the user can only transfer to the accounts that the user owns. In other embodiments, the user owns a master account and transfers to sub-accounts that are for sharing with or providing access to other users. In some embodiments, the user may select to undo the transfer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> ends in step <b>542</b>. Another example of a banking transaction is money sharing, which is described in further detail in U.S. patent application No. Ser. No. 10/966,958 entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Money Sharing&#x201d; filed on Oct. 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Also, in some embodiments, the user may send an e-mail through the kiosk <b>100</b>, and the kiosk <b>100</b> may display a reply e-mail for customer services purposes.</p>
