<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a sensor having a sensor element and a flexible board with an end connected to a measuring portion of the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A pressure sensor for measuring fluid pressure by measuring physical quantities is known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional example of such a pressure sensor includes: a pressure-sensitive element attached to an end of a pipe; a circuit board; and a flexible board having an end connected to the pressure-sensitive element and the other end connected to the circuit board (document: JP-A-2005-326337).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The flexible board is employed for transmitting a signal of the pressure-sensitive element to the circuit board. In the conventional example disclosed in the above document, the flexible board is bent for accommodating within the pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the flexible board of the conventional example disclosed in the above-mentioned document is bent for accommodating within the pipe, copper pattern provided on the flexible board may be cracked or otherwise damaged when the flexible board is bent for accommodating within the pipe. In order not to cause cracks and the like on the copper pattern, the bending angle of the flexible board has to be increased, which requires a large accommodation space for the flexible board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the invention is to provide a sensor that does not cause damage on a flexible board when the flexible board is bent to be accommodated and is capable of accommodating the flexible board with a compact space, and a manufacturing method of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A sensor according to an aspect of the invention includes: a sensor element provided with a measuring portion and attached to a joint; a cap provided on the measuring portion of the sensor element; a flexible board having a first end connected to the cap and a second end extending in a direction away from the sensor element; and a cover that supports the flexible board while the flexible board is curved, the cover being attached to the cap or the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above arrangement, after the cap is attached to the sensor element and the first end of the flexible board is connected to the cap by thermocompression-bonding using an adhesive sheet and the like, the cover is attached to the cap or the sensor element and the flexible board is curved along the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the flexible board the first end of which is connected to the sensor element, is supported by the cover while being curved, the flexible board is not bent locally at an acute angle. Accordingly, a crack is not generated on the electro-conductive portion, a copper pattern for instance, provided on the flexible board. In addition, since the flexible board is bent along the cover, the flexible board is bent by a minimum required angle within a narrow space, thus reducing the accommodation space of the flexible board.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above aspect, it is preferable that a board holder for holding the flexible board is provided within the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the above arrangement, since the first end of the flexible board is not only supported by the cover but a part near the second end is held and fixed by the board holder, both of the ends of the flexible board are securely supported even when the sensor itself is vibrated. Therefore, while, using the sensor, the damage on the electro-conductive portion of the flexible board can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, in the above aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the sensor element is airtightly bonded to the joint, and the board holder intercommunicates a sensor-interior space near the sensor element and another sensor-interior space remote from the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the above arrangement, since the two sensor spaces sandwiching the board holder are intercommunicated even when the inside of the sensor is kept airtight, the inside of the sensor does not become excessively humid even when the temperature and humidity is changed, so that the sensor can sufficiently adapt itself to the change in the sensor environment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the above aspect of the invention, the board holder may preferably have an elasticity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the above arrangement, the flexible board is pressed onto the cover by the elastic force of the board holder, so that the displacement of the flexible board when the sensor is vibrated can be further effectively restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the above aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the cover has an arc surface that supports the flexible board while the flexible board is curved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the above arrangement, since the flexible board can be curved along the arc surface, the bending of the flexible board at an acute angle can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A manufacturing method according to another aspect of the invention is for manufacturing the sensor of the above aspect of the invention, the method includes:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">attaching a cap on the sensor element; connecting the first end of the flexible board on the cap; attaching the cover on the cap or the sensor element; curving the flexible board along the cover; and directing the second end of the flexible board in a direction away from the sensor element to hold the flexible board within the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the above aspect of the invention, the manufacturing method for a sensor that can exhibit the same advantages as in the above can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a specific construction of the board holder <b>23</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The board holder <b>23</b> is made of an elastic cushion material. The cushion material is, for instance, a molding component of a foam rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, how the pressure sensor <b>1</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment is assembled will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Initially, the first end <b>14</b>A of the flexible board <b>14</b> and the cap <b>16</b> are thermocompression-bonded with an adhesive sheet and the cap <b>16</b> is fixed on the diaphragm <b>11</b> by laser-welding.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Subsequently, the diaphragm <b>11</b> and the flexible board <b>14</b> are connected by wire-bonding using gold. Then, the cap <b>16</b> and the cover <b>22</b> are adhered and fixed by an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the belt portion <b>14</b>C of the flexible board <b>14</b> is placed on the arc surface <b>22</b>C of the cover <b>22</b> and is bent in an arc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The belt portion <b>14</b>C of the flexible board <b>14</b> is bent substantially at a right angle in a direction reverse to that in the preceding bending. Then, the board holder <b>23</b> is assembled with the flexed belt portion <b>14</b>C and is compressed to be inserted into the joint <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The joint <b>10</b> and the diaphragm <b>11</b> are airtightly connected by an electron-beam welding, the circuit board <b>13</b> is fixed on the flange <b>10</b>E of the joint <b>10</b> and the circuit board <b>13</b> and the flexible board <b>14</b> are soldered. At this time, the flexible board <b>14</b> is soldered while being bent in an arc.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, after fixing the flexible board <b>14</b> and the joint <b>10</b> with an adhesive and fixing the case <b>21</b> onto the joint <b>10</b> by projection-welding, the case <b>21</b> and the terminal <b>15</b> are crimped.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Then, the terminal <b>15</b> and the circuit board <b>13</b> are connected by precision resistance welding, the housing <b>12</b> assembled with the O ring <b>17</b> is inserted and the housing <b>12</b> is crimped to the joint <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to the exemplary embodiment, the following advantages can be provided.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0075">(1) The pressure sensor <b>1</b> includes the cap <b>16</b> provided on the diaphragm <b>11</b>, the first end <b>14</b>A of the flexible board <b>14</b> being connected to the cap <b>16</b> and the second end <b>14</b>B of the flexible board <b>14</b> being held to extend in a direction away from the diaphragm <b>11</b>, and the cover <b>22</b> that supports the flexible board <b>14</b> while being curved is attached to the cap <b>16</b>. Accordingly, since the flexible board <b>14</b> is not locally bent at an acute angle, no crack is generated on the copper pattern <b>14</b>E provided on the flexible board <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the flexible board <b>14</b> can be bent at a required minimum angle within a narrow space, so that the size of the accommodating space of the flexible board <b>14</b> can be reduced.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0076">(2) The belt portion <b>14</b>C of the flexible board <b>14</b> having the first end connected to the cap <b>16</b> is held by the board holder <b>23</b> over a predetermined length and the board holder <b>23</b> is fixed within the joint <b>10</b>. Accordingly, even when the sensor itself is vibrated while, for instance, using the sensor <b>1</b>, the flexible board <b>14</b> can be securely supported, thereby preventing a damage on the copper pattern <b>14</b>E on the flexible board <b>14</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">In this regard, there is a gap between the flexible board connecting the circuit board and the sensor and an insulating member provided on an inner circumference of a case in the traditional example disclosed in JP-A-2006-38824, so that the flexible board is displaced by vibration and the like, which causes damage on the copper pattern provided on the flexible board.
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0078">(3) Since the base section <b>23</b>A of the board holder <b>23</b> is supported by the cover <b>22</b>, both of the ends of the flexible board <b>14</b> is supported by the cover <b>22</b> as well as the board holder <b>23</b>, thereby stably supporting the board holder <b>23</b>. Further, since the cover <b>22</b> is disposed between the board holder <b>23</b> and the cap <b>16</b>, the board holder <b>23</b> does not interfere with the cap <b>16</b>, so that the bonding wire provided on the first end <b>14</b>A of the flexible board <b>14</b> is not damaged.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0079">(4) The board holder <b>23</b> is an elastic cushion material, which provides excellent cushioning effect, so that the displacement of the flexible board <b>14</b> while the sensor is vibrated can be further efficiently restrained.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0080">(5) Since the board holder <b>23</b> is molded by a foam rubber, air permeability of the foam rubber itself allows adaptation for the change in the temperature and environment.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0081">(6) Since the cover <b>22</b> is provided with the arc surface <b>22</b>C that supports the flexible board <b>14</b> while being curved, acute-bending of the flexible board <b>14</b> can be effectively prevented when the flexible board <b>14</b> is mounted on the cover <b>22</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0082">(7) The air-vent filter <b>19</b> provided on the housing <b>12</b> allows communication between the inside of the sensor and the external air even when the inside of the housing <b>12</b> is sealed, thereby providing adaptation for the change in the external environment.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0083">(8) Since the air-vent filter <b>19</b> is provided on the distal end <b>12</b>B of the housing <b>12</b> at a position covered by the connector <b>18</b>, water, oil and the like do not directly adhere to the air-vent filter <b>19</b>, thereby preventing the air-vent filter <b>19</b> from being clogged.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0084">(9) Since a part of the flexible board <b>14</b> is fixed on the interior wall of the joint <b>10</b>, the flexible board <b>14</b> is not vibrated even when the sensor <b>1</b> itself is vibrated while, for instance, transporting the sensor <b>1</b>, thereby preventing the copper pattern <b>14</b>E from being damaged.</li>

<p id="p-0077" num="0085">Next, a second exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The second exemplary embodiment differs from the first exemplary embodiment in the structure of the board holder, while the rest of the arrangement is identical. Accordingly, in the following description of the second exemplary embodiment, the same components as those of the first exemplary embodiment are referenced by the same code to simplify the description thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross section showing an entire arrangement of the second exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an elastic board holder <b>123</b> that holds the flexible board <b>14</b> is disposed adjacent to the cover <b>22</b> within the joint <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the board holder <b>123</b> is provided by filling a recessed space defined by an upper side of the cover <b>22</b> and the inner circumference of the joint <b>10</b> with a heat-conductive molding material. The heat-conductive molding material is a room-temperature curing or heat-curing material, which is flowable before being filled in the space within the joint <b>10</b> (i.e. before being cured) and is cured after being filled in the space within the joint <b>10</b> at a room-temperature or by heating to a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0089">A tube <b>124</b> penetrates through the board holder <b>123</b> for adjusting variable internal pressure within the cover <b>22</b>. The tube <b>124</b> is a rubber-made component that intercommunicates the sensor-interior space adjacent to the diaphragm <b>11</b> and the sensor-interior space on a side remote from the diaphragm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0090">Incidentally, though an end of the board holder <b>123</b> near the circuit board <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> does not reach the periphery of the tapered hole <b>10</b>C, the end of the board holder <b>123</b> may be located at a position adjacent to the circuit board <b>13</b>. In this case, an end of the tube <b>124</b> is also extended toward the neighborhood of the circuit board <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091">Next, how the pressure sensor <b>1</b> according to the second exemplary embodiment is assembled will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0092">Initially, as in the first exemplary embodiment, the cap <b>16</b> and the cover <b>22</b> are adhered with an adhesive and the belt portion <b>14</b>C of the flexible board <b>14</b> is placed on the arc surface <b>22</b>C of the cover <b>22</b> and is bent in an arc. The belt portion <b>14</b>C of the flexible board <b>14</b> is bent substantially at a right angle in a direction reverse to that in the preceding bending. Then, the bent belt portion <b>14</b>C is placed in the interior space of the joint <b>10</b>. Further, in this state, the tube <b>124</b> is inserted into the cover <b>22</b> and the molding material of the board holder <b>123</b> is filled into the interior space of the joint <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">After the joint <b>10</b> and the diaphragm <b>11</b> are airtightly connected in the same manner as in the first exemplary embodiment, the circuit board <b>13</b> is fixed on the flange <b>10</b>E of the joint <b>10</b> and the circuit board <b>13</b> and the flexible board <b>14</b> are soldered.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0095">Accordingly, the following advantages can be obtained in the second exemplary embodiment as well as advantages (1)-(3) and (6)-(9) of the first exemplary embodiment.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0096">(10) Since the board holder <b>123</b> has an elasticity, the flexible board <b>14</b> is pressed onto the cover <b>22</b>, so that the displacement of the flexible board <b>14</b> during the vibration of the sensor can be further effectively restrained.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0097">(11) Since the board holder <b>123</b> is provided by filling a molding material into the interior space of the joint <b>10</b>, the flexible board <b>14</b> can be supported during the formation of the board holder <b>123</b>, so that the flexible board <b>14</b> can be supported with a simple arrangement.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0098">(12) The diaphragm <b>11</b> is airtightly bonded to the joint <b>10</b> while the board holder <b>123</b> allows communication between the inside and the outside of the sensor through the tube <b>124</b> and the air-vent filter <b>19</b>. Accordingly, irrespective of the change in the temperature and humidity, the atmosphere within the sensor does not become excessively humid, so that a sensor that is sufficiently adapted for a change in the environment can be provided.</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0099">Incidentally, the scope of the present invention is not limited to what is disclosed in the above exemplary embodiment, but modifications, improvements and the like are within the scope of the present invention as long as an object of the present invention can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0100">For instance, the board holders <b>23</b>, <b>123</b> may not be provided in the exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0101">When the board holders <b>23</b>, <b>123</b> are provided, the specific construction thereof is not limited to those described in the exemplary embodiments. For instance, the material of the board holder may be hard synthetic resin or metal instead of urethane foam. However, it should be noted that, when metal is used as the board holder, since the board holder is disposed adjacent to or in contact with the copper pattern <b>14</b>E of the flexible board <b>14</b>, it is necessary that at least a part of the board holder to be in contact with the flexible board <b>14</b> is provided with nonconductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0102">The invention is not applied limitatively to the pressure sensor, but may be applied to a differential-pressure sensor, temperature sensor and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0103">Though the cover <b>22</b> is attached to the cap <b>16</b>, the cover <b>22</b> of the invention may alternatively be attached to the diaphragm <b>11</b>.</p>
