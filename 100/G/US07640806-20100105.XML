<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-4790 filed on Jan. 12, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a capacitive physical quantity sensor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,483,322 (corresponding to JP-A-2000-40047) discloses a capacitive acceleration sensor used in an automotive vehicle. In a sensor element of the sensor, a capacitive variation is generated by an acceleration variation. The capacitive variation is converted into an electrical signal by a capacitance-voltage (C-V) conversion circuit. The converted signal is differentially amplified by a signal processing circuit including a sampling and holding circuit and a switched capacitor circuit. Thus, the sensor can output an output signal corresponding to the acceleration variation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to output a sensitive output signal, a high-power C-V conversion circuit and a high-gain amplifying circuit are required in the capacitive acceleration sensor. Therefore, the C-V conversion circuit includes a switched capacitor system, and performs a high-power C-V conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the C-V conversion circuit including the switched capacitor system, an analog switch has a circuitry shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, the analog switch includes a P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (Pch-MOS) transistor <b>101</b> and a N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (Nch-MOS) transistor <b>102</b>. The Pch-MOS transistor <b>101</b> has a back gate potential VG of Vdd, and the Nch-MOS transistor <b>102</b> has a ground potential GND as its back gate potential VG. Then, a potential difference is generated between an input potential from a sensor element and the back gate potential VG of the transistor <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. Therefore, electricity leak may be generated in a semiconductor substrate, on which the transistors <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are formed. Especially, the electricity leak may be large in a high-temperature range. Thus, a temperature characteristic of a zero-point offset or sensitivity may be lowered, especially in the high-temperature range.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing and other problems, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a capacitive physical quantity sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a capacitive physical quantity sensor includes a sensor element and a detecting circuit. The sensor element includes a movable electrode displaceable in accordance with a variation of a physical quantity, and first and second fixed electrodes facing the movable electrode. The first periodic carrier wave voltage is applied to the first fixed electrode and a second periodic carrier wave voltage is applied to the second fixed electrode. The first and second voltages are inverse to each other. The detecting circuit includes a capacitance-voltage conversion circuit, into which an input potential corresponding to a variation of a capacitance between the movable electrode and the first and second fixed electrodes is input, and from which a voltage signal corresponding to the variation of the capacitance is output. The capacitance-voltage conversion circuit includes an operational amplifier, a capacitor and a switch. A signal corresponding to the variation of the capacitance is input into an inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier. The capacitor is connected between the inverting input terminal and an output terminal of the operational amplifier. The switch is connected in parallel to the capacitor, and includes a P-channel MOS transistor and a N-channel MOS transistor, which are connected in parallel to the capacitor. The P-channel MOS transistor and the N-channel MOS transistor have a back gate potential, which is approximately equal to an average voltage of the first periodic carrier wave voltage and the second periodic carrier wave voltage.</p>

An inverting input terminal of the amplifier <b>21</b><i>a </i>is connected to the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b </i>and the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>are connected in parallel to the amplifier <b>21</b><i>a </i>between the inverting input terminal and an output terminal. The switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>is driven by a signal S<b>1</b> from the control signal generating circuit <b>24</b>. A voltage supplied from the center voltage supplying circuit <b>21</b><i>d </i>is input into a non-inverting input terminal of the amplifier <b>21</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>includes a P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (Pch-MOS) transistor <b>21</b><i>ca </i>and a N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (Nch-MOS) transistor <b>21</b><i>cb</i>. The Pch-MOS transistor <b>21</b><i>ca </i>and the Nch-MOS transistor <b>21</b><i>cb </i>are connected in parallel to each other. That is, sources of the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb </i>are connected to each other, and drains of the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb </i>are connected to each other. A constant-voltage source <b>24</b> supplies a constant voltage Vdd. Voltage dividing resistors <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>divide the constant voltage Vdd into the center voltage Vdd/2, and the center voltage Vdd/2 is applied to back gate potentials VG of the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb </i>through a voltage follower <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the signal S<b>1</b> is applied to gates of the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb</i>, and the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb </i>are turned on/off in response to the signal S<b>1</b>. The differential amplification circuit <b>22</b> includes a sampling and holding (SH) circuit <b>22</b><i>a</i>, an amplifying (AMP) circuit <b>22</b><i>b </i>and a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit <b>22</b><i>c</i>. The SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>is driven by a signal S<b>2</b> from the control signal generating circuit <b>23</b>. The SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>samples an output from the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b>, and holds the output for a predetermined period. The amplifying circuit <b>22</b><i>b </i>amplifies the output with a predetermined gain. The LPF circuit <b>22</b><i>c </i>is driven by a signal F<b>1</b> from the control signal generating circuit <b>23</b>. The LPF circuit <b>22</b><i>c </i>selects a signal in a predetermined frequency band component from the outputs of the SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and outputs the signal as an acceleration signal. The control signal generating circuit <b>23</b> outputs the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> with a predetermined period, the signal S<b>1</b> instructing a timing for switching the switch <b>21</b><i>c</i>, the signal S<b>2</b> for the SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the signal F<b>1</b> for the LPF circuit <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Next, an operation of the acceleration sensor will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each of the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> from the circuit <b>23</b> has a predetermined amplitude of a voltage Vdd (5V), and levels of the voltages Vdd of the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> are inverse to each other. The signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> have rectangular-wave shapes with the predetermined amplitude, and vary between a high level (Hi) and a low level (Lo) in four periods T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> in each detection cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the first period T<b>1</b>, the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> set an electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>to Vdd, and an electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>to 0V. Further, the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>is closed by the signal S<b>1</b> from the circuit <b>23</b>. Thus, the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>have a bias voltage Vdd/2 by an operation of the amplifier <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and an electrical charge in the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b </i>is discharged, which will be a feedback capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If a capacitance C<b>1</b> between the movable electrode <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is larger than a capacitance C<b>2</b> between the movable electrode <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>(i.e., C<b>1</b>&#x3e;C<b>2</b>), the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>hold a large amount of negative charges, because of this relation and the voltages applied to the fixed electrodes <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the second period T<b>2</b>, the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> set the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>to Vdd, and the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>to 0V. Further, the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>is opened by the signal S<b>1</b>. Thereby, the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b </i>is charged with electricity corresponding to a state of the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Then, the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b> outputs a voltage signal corresponding to the charge in the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b</i>, and the SH circuit <b>23</b><i>a </i>samples and holds the voltage signal in response to the signal S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the third period T<b>3</b>, the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> set the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>to 0V, and the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>to Vdd. That is, the electrical potentials are interchanged. Further, the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>is kept to be open by the signal S<b>1</b>. At this time, a state of the electrical charge in the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>is inverse to that in the second period T<b>2</b> due to an inversion of the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b>. That is, when the capacitance C<b>1</b> is larger than the capacitance C<b>2</b> (C<b>1</b>&#x3e;C<b>2</b>), the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>hold a large amount of positive charges due to an inversion of the voltages applied to the fixed electrodes <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, at this time, because a circuit between the movable electrode <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b </i>is closed, the electrical charges discharged in the first period T<b>1</b> are stored in the circuit. Therefore, a part of the electrical charges is transferred and stored in the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b </i>for balance. Then, the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b> outputs a voltage signal, which is proportional to the transferred charge, and inversely proportional to a capacitance C of the capacitor <b>21</b><i>b</i>, based on a relation of Q=CV.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the fourth period T<b>4</b>, the signals PW<b>1</b>, PW<b>2</b> set the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>to 0V, and the electrical potential of the fixed electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>to Vdd. After the voltage signal from the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b> becomes sufficiently stable, the SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>samples and holds the voltage signal from the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b> in response to the signal S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>performs a differential calculation between the voltage signal sampled in the second period T<b>2</b> and the voltage signal sampled in the fourth period T<b>4</b>, and outputs the calculated result. Based on the result, an acceleration corresponding to a displacement of the movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The movable electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>have a bias potential Vdd/2, as described above. At this time, the Pch-MOS transistor <b>21</b><i>ca </i>and the Nch-MOS transistor <b>21</b><i>cb </i>have the back gate potential VG of Vdd/2. Therefore, a difference between the movable electrode <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>potential corresponding to an input voltage Vin and the back gate potential VG can be eliminated. Accordingly, electricity is restricted from leaking in a semiconductor substrate, on which the transistors <b>21</b><i>ca</i>, <b>21</b><i>cb </i>are formed, and temperature characteristic of a zero-point offset or sensitivity can be maintained.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>includes a calculation amplifiers <b>22</b><i>aa</i>, <b>22</b><i>ad</i>, a switch <b>22</b><i>ab </i>and a capacitor <b>22</b><i>ac</i>. When the switch <b>22</b><i>ab </i>is turned on at a sampling time, the capacitor <b>22</b><i>ac </i>is charged with the input potential Vin from the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b>. When the switch <b>22</b><i>ab </i>is turned off, the input potential Vin is stored in the capacitor <b>22</b><i>ac. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The switch <b>22</b><i>ab </i>of the SH circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>has a structure, which is similar to the structure of the switch <b>21</b><i>c </i>of the C-V conversion circuit <b>21</b>.
