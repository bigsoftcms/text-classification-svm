<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The use of tinted, or colored, contact lenses to either or both alter the natural color of the iris and to mask ophthalmic abnormalities is well known. Typically, these lenses use either or both opaque and translucent colors to change the color of an iris, as for example, from brown to blue. Additionally, tinted lenses have been manufactured that attempt to enhance the color of a dark-eyed person without changing the color of the iris. These lenses are disadvantageous because either the color enhancement is too subtle to be noticed when the lens is on-eye or the enhancement lends an unnatural appearance to the wearer's iris. Therefore, a need exists for lenses that enhance the color of a dark eye that overcomes these disadvantages.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention provides tinted contact lenses, and methods for their manufacture, that enhance the lens wearer's iris. The lenses of the invention have a pattern that includes a limbal ring that serves to enhance the definition of the wearer's iris resulting in the iris appearing larger to viewer's of the lens wearer. Additionally, the lenses of the invention have additional pattern elements that partially overlie the wearer's iris. The lenses of the invention may find greatest utility as cosmetic lenses for enhancing a dark-eyed individual's iris, but also may be used to enhance the iris of a light-eyed lens wearer as well.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the invention provides a contact lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of a limbal ring and a fibrous dot pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By &#x201c;limbal ring&#x201d; is meant an annular band of color that, when the lens is on-eye and centered, partially or substantially completely overlies the lens wearer's limbal region, or the junction of the sclera with the cornea. Preferably, the limbal ring substantially completely overlies the limbal region. The innermost border, or edge closest to the geometric center of the lens, of the limbal ring may be about 8 mm to about 12 mm, preferably about 9 to about 11 mm, from the lens' geometric center. The ring may be of any suitable width and preferably is about 0.5 to about 2.5 mm in width, more preferably about 0.75 to about 1.25 mm in width.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Adjacent to the limbal ring's innermost edge is a fibrous dot pattern. By &#x201c;fibrous dot pattern&#x201d; is meant a pattern of dots that are arranged such that they appear to form a plurality of fibrous structures in which each of the individual fibrous structures may or may not be intertwined with other of the fibrous structures. The dot pattern used in the lenses of the invention does not extend over the entire iris portion of the lens, meaning the portion of the lens that overlies the iris when the lens is on-eye and centered. Rather, the dot pattern extends inwardly from the innermost edge of the limbal ring so that the innermost border, or edge relative to the geometric center of the lens, of the fibrous dot pattern is located at about 6.5 mm or greater, preferably about 7 mm or greater from the geometric center of the lens. The dots used in the pattern may be of any size and preferably are about 0.060 to about 0.180 mm in diameter, more preferably about 0.0075 to about 0.0125 mm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown limbal ring-fibrous dot pattern <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, limbal ring <b>11</b> is a black opaque band that is approximately 1 mm in width. Beginning at the innermost border <b>14</b> of limbal ring <b>11</b> and extending inwardly towards the geometric center of the lens is fibrous dot pattern <b>12</b> composed of a plurality of substantially intertwined fibrous structures. Preferably, the fibrous structures are random, meaning that no repeating clusters of fibrous structures are included in the fibrous dot pattern. The innermost border <b>15</b> of fibrous dot pattern <b>12</b> lies at a diameter of 7 mm from the geometric center of the lens. Innermost borders <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> as shown are even, regular borders, but either or both may have an uneven, irregularly shape. Also shown is area <b>13</b>, a region in which there are no pattern elements. Area <b>13</b> will overlie part of the iris portion as well as the whole of the pupil portion, which pupil portion will overlie the wearer's pupil, when the lens is on-eye and centered. As shown and preferably, area <b>13</b> is clear. However area <b>13</b> may be an area of translucent or opaque color or any combination of opaque and translucent colors.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts another embodiment, pattern <b>20</b>. Pattern <b>20</b> includes fibrous dot pattern <b>22</b> that begins at the innermost edge <b>24</b> of limbal ring <b>21</b>. An area <b>25</b> also is included in which area a plurality of randomly placed dots overlay a part of fibrous dot pattern <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used in a lens for either enhancing or altering the wearer's eye color, preferably the limbal ring element is a solid band of color that masks the color of the lens wearer's limbal region and more preferably the masking color is an opaque color. The remaining elements, the dots which make up the fibrous and spoke patterns, random dots, dot clusters, and gradient may be translucent or opaque depending on the desired on-eye result. For purposes of the invention, by &#x201c;translucent&#x201d; is meant a color that permits an average light transmittance (% T) in the 380 to 780 nm range of about 60 to about 99%, preferably about 65 to about 85% T. By &#x201c;opaque&#x201d; is meant a color that permits an average light transmittance (% T) in the 380 to 780 nm range of 0 to about 55, preferably 7 to about 50% T.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The color of the limbal ring may be substantially the same as, or complementary to, the color selected for the remaining elements. Preferably, all elements are of the same color. The color selected for each of the limbal ring and remaining pattern elements will be determined by the natural color of the lens wearer's iris and the enhancement or color change desired. Thus, elements may be any color including, without limitation, any of a variety of hues and chromas of blue, green, gray, brown, black yellow, red, or combinations thereof. Preferred colors for the limbal ring include, without limitation, any of the various hues and crhomas of black, brown and gray.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The elements, may be made from any organic or inorganic pigment suitable for use in contact lenses, or combinations of such pigments. The opacity may be controlled by varying the concentration of the pigment and titanium dioxide used, with higher amounts yielding greater opacity. Illustrative organic pigments include, without limitation, pthalocyanine blue, pthalocyanine green, carbazole violet, vat orange # 1, and the like and combinations thereof. Examples of useful inorganic pigments include, without limitation, iron oxide black, iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, titanium dioxide, and the like, and combinations thereof. In addition to these pigments, soluble and non-soluble dyes may be used including, without limitation, dichlorotriazine and vinyl sulfone-based dyes. Useful dyes and pigments are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The dye or pigment selected may be combined with one or more of a pre-polymer, or binding polymer, and a solvent to form the colorant used to produce the translucent and opaque layers used in the lenses of the invention. Other additives useful in contact lens colorants also may be used. The binding polymers, solvents, and other additives useful in the color layers of the invention are known and either commercially available or methods for their making are known.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The elements may be applied to, or printed on, one or more surfaces of a lens or may be printed onto one or more surfaces of a mold into which a lens forming material will be deposited and cured. In a preferred method for forming lenses incorporating the designs of the invention, a thermoplastic optical mold, made from any suitable material including, without limitation, cyclic polyolefins and polyolefins such as polypropylene or polystyrene resin is used. The elements are deposited onto the desired portion of the molding surface of the mold. By &#x201c;molding surface&#x201d; is meant the surface of a mold or mold half used to form a surface of a lens. Preferably, the deposition is carried out by pad printing as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A metal plate, preferably made from steel and more preferably from stainless steel, is covered with a photo resist material that is capable of becoming water insoluble once cured. The elements are selected or designed and then reduced to the desired size using any of a number of techniques such as photographic techniques, placed over the metal plate, and the photo resist material is cured.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The plate is subsequently washed with an aqueous solution and the resulting image is etched into the plate to a suitable depth, for example about 20 microns. A colorant containing a binding polymer, solvent, and pigment or dye is then deposited onto the elements to fill the depressions with colorant. A silicon pad of a geometry suitable for use in printing on the surface and varying hardness, generally about 1 to about 10, is pressed against the image on the plate to remove the colorant and the colorant is then dried slightly by evaporation of the solvent. The pad is then pressed against the molding surface of an optical mold. The mold is degassed for up to 12 hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the mold is filled with lens material. A complementary mold half is then used to complete the mold assembly and the mold assembly is exposed to conditions suitable to cure the lens material used. Such conditions are well known in the art and will depend upon the lens material selected. Once curing is completed and the lens is released from the mold, it is equilibrated in a buffered saline solution.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment, a clear, pre-polymer layer is used, which pre-polymer layer overlays at least the limbal ring and dot patterns and preferably forms the entirety of the lens' outermost surface. The pre-polymer may be any polymer that is capable of dispersing the pigment and any opacifying agent used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention may be used to provide tinted hard or soft contact lenses made of any known lens-forming material, or material suitable for manufacturing such lenses. Preferably, the lenses of the invention are soft contact lenses the material selected for forming the lenses of the invention being any material suitable for producing soft contact lenses.
