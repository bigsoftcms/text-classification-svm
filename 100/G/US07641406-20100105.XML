The disclosures of JP 2007-195031 and JP 2007-195032 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a substrate processing apparatus that subjects substrates to processing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Substrate processing apparatuses are used to subject various types of substrates such as semiconductor substrates, substrates for liquid crystal displays, plasma displays, optical disks, magnetic disks, and magneto-optical disks, photomasks, and other substrates to various types of processing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a substrate processing apparatus generally subjects a single substrate to a plurality of different types of processing successively. A substrate processing apparatus as described in JP 2003-324139 A includes an indexer block, an anti-reflection film processing block, a resist film processing block, a development processing block, and an interface block. An exposure device is arranged adjacent to the interface block as an external device separate from the substrate processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above-mentioned substrate processing apparatus, a substrate carried thereinto from the indexer block is transported to the exposure device through the interface block after being subjected to anti-reflection film formation and resist film coating processing in the anti-reflection film processing block and the resist film processing block. After the resist film on the substrate is subjected to exposure processing in the exposure device, the substrate is transported to the development processing block through the interface block. After the resist film on the substrate is subjected to development processing to form a resist pattern thereon in the development processing block, the substrate is transported to the indexer block.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With recent increases in density and integration of devices, making finer resist patterns has become an important problem. Conventional exposure devices have generally performed exposure processing by reduction-projecting reticle patterns on substrates through projection lenses. In such conventional exposure devices, however, the line widths of exposure patterns are determined by the wavelengths of light sources of the exposure devices. Therefore, making finer resist patterns has had limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, as projection exposure methods allowing for finer exposure patterns, a liquid immersion method is suggested (see, e.g., WO99/49504 pamphlet). In the projection exposure device according to the WO99/49504 pamphlet, an area between a projection optical system and a substrate is filled with a liquid, resulting in a shorter wavelength of exposure light on a top surface of the substrate. This allows for a finer exposure pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the projection exposure device according to the above-mentioned WO99/49504 pamphlet, however, exposure processing is performed with the substrate and the liquid brought into contact with each other. When a contaminant adheres to the substrate before the exposure processing, the contaminant is mixed into the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although the substrate is subjected to various types of film formation processing before the exposure processing, a bevel portion of the substrate or its peripheral portion may, in some cases, be contaminated in the process of the film formation processing.

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the bevel portion or the peripheral portion of the substrate contaminated even during the film formation processing of the substrate, films may not be normally formed on the substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a substrate processing apparatus that can prevent defective processing caused by contamination of a bevel portion of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate processing apparatus that can prevent defective processing caused by contamination of an end portion of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(1) According to an aspect of the present invention, a substrate processing apparatus that is arranged adjacent to an exposure device includes a processing section for subjecting a substrate to processing, an interface provided adjacent to one end of the processing section for receiving and transferring the substrate between the processing section and the exposure device, and a controller that controls the respective operations of the processing section and the interface, in which at least one of the processing section and the interface includes a bevel portion inspection device that inspects the state of a bevel portion of the substrate to determine whether or not the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated, and the controller performs a first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated, while performing a second control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is not contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the substrate processing apparatus, the processing section subjects the substrate to predetermined processing, and the interface receives and transfers the substrate from the processing section to the exposure device. After the exposure device subjects the substrate to the exposure processing, the interface returns the substrate after the exposure processing from the exposure device to the processing section. The controller controls the respective operations of the processing section and the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In at least one of the processing section and the interface, the bevel portion inspection device inspects the state of the bevel portion of the substrate, to determine whether or not the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated. The controller performs the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated, while performing the second control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is not contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first or second control operation is thus performed on the basis of the results of the determination whether or not the bevel portion is contaminated, which can prevent defective processing of the substrate due to the contamination of the bevel portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(2) The bevel portion inspection device may inspect the bevel portion of the substrate before exposure processing by the exposure device, and the controller may control the interface such that the substrate is not transported to the exposure device as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated before the exposure processing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this case, the substrate whose bevel portion has been contaminated is not transported to the exposure device, which prevents contamination in the exposure device. This prevents a defective dimension and a defective shape of an exposure pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(3) At least one of the processing section and the interface may include a cleaning processing unit that subjects the substrate before the exposure processing by the exposure device to cleaning processing, the bevel portion inspection device may inspect the bevel portion of the substrate after the cleaning processing by the cleaning processing unit, and the controller may control at least one of the processing section and the interface such that the substrate is not transported to the exposure device as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated after the cleaning processing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this case, after the cleaning processing unit subjects the substrate to the cleaning processing, the bevel portion inspection device inspects the state of the bevel portion of the substrate. Therefore, the ratio of the substrates whose bevel portions are determined to be contaminated is reduced. This causes the ratio of the substrates that are transported to the exposure device to be increased, resulting in improved yield.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">(4) The controller may control at least one of the processing section and the interface such that the substrate is subjected to the cleaning processing by the cleaning processing unit again as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this case, after the cleaning processing unit removes a contaminant that adheres to the bevel portion of the substrate, the substrate can be transported to the exposure device. This results in further improved yield.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">(5) The cleaning processing unit may include a bevel portion cleaning mechanism for cleaning the bevel portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this case, the cleaning processing unit can sufficiently remove the contaminant that adheres to the bevel portion of the substrate. This causes the ratio of the substrates that are transported to the exposure device to be further increased, resulting in further improved yield.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">(6) The substrate processing apparatus may further include an alarm generation device that generates an alarm in accordance with the control operation of the controller, the bevel portion inspection device may inspect the bevel portion of the substrate after the exposure processing by the exposure device, and the controller may control the alarm generation device so as to generate the alarm as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated after the exposure processing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this case, when the exposure device is contaminated or is not normally operated, the bevel portion of the substrate may be contaminated during the exposure processing. By causing the alarm generation device to generate the alarm when it is determined that the bevel portion of the substrate after the exposure processing is contaminated, therefore, an operator can be made to recognize the timing of maintaining the exposure device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(7) The processing section may include a film formation unit that subjects the substrate before the exposure processing by the exposure device to film formation processing, the bevel portion inspection device may inspect the bevel portion of the substrate before the film formation processing by the film formation unit, and the controller may control the processing section such that the substrate is not subjected to the film formation processing by the film formation unit as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated before the film formation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this case, the film formation unit subjects the substrate whose bevel portion is clean to the film formation processing. This can prevent defective film formation processing caused by the contamination of the bevel portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">(8) The substrate processing apparatus may further include a transport device that transports the substrate between the processing section and a plurality of storing containers in accordance with the control operation of the controller, in which the processing section may include a development processing unit that subjects the substrate after the exposure processing by the exposure device to development processing, the bevel portion inspection device may inspect the bevel portion of the substrate after the development processing by the development processing unit, and the controller may control the transport device such that the substrate is stored in one of the plurality of storing containers as the first control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion of the substrate is contaminated after the development processing, while controlling the transport device such that the substrate is stored in the other one of the plurality of storing containers as the second control operation when the bevel portion inspection device determines that the bevel portion is not contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this case, the substrate whose bevel portion has been contaminated and the substrate whose bevel portion is clean are respectively stored in the separate storing containers, which can prevent the substrate whose bevel portion has been contaminated from being fed as it is to the subsequent processing process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(9) According to another aspect of the present invention, a substrate processing apparatus that is arranged adjacent to an exposure device may include a processing section having a processing unit that subjects a substrate to processing, an interface provided adjacent to one end of the processing section for receiving and transferring the substrate between the processing section and the exposure device, and a controller that controls the respective operations of the processing section and the interface, in which the processing unit has an end portion inspection device that inspects the state of an end portion of the substrate after the substrate is subjected to predetermined processing, and the controller determines whether or not the end portion of the substrate is in a good state on the basis of the results of the inspection by the end portion inspection device, to perform a first control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in the good state, while performing a second control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in a not-good state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the substrate processing apparatus, the processing unit subjects the substrate to the predetermined processing in the processing section, and the interface receives and transfers the substrate from the processing section to the exposure device. After the exposure device subjects the substrate to the exposure processing, the interface returns the substrate after the exposure processing from the exposure device to the processing section. The controller controls the respective operations of the processing section and the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the processing unit, the end portion inspection device inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate after the substrate is subjected to the predetermined processing. The controller determines whether or not the end portion of the substrate is in the good state on the basis of the results of the inspection. The controller performs the first control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in the good state, while performing the second control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in the not-good state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, the first control operation or the second control operation is selectively performed depending on the state of the end portion of the substrate after the processing in the processing unit, which can prevent defective processing of the substrate caused by the state of the end portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">(10) The processing unit may include a film formation processing unit that subjects the substrate before the exposure processing by the exposure device to film formation processing, the film formation processing unit may include a processing liquid supplier that supplies a processing liquid for the film formation processing onto the substrate, and a processing liquid remover that removes the processing liquid supplied onto the substrate by the processing liquid supplier, and the end portion inspection device may inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate after the processing liquid supplier supplies the processing liquid onto the substrate in the film formation processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this case, in the film formation processing unit, the processing liquid supplier supplies the processing liquid onto the substrate, so that the substrate is subjected to the film formation processing. After the film formation processing, the end portion inspection device inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The substrate can be suitably subjected to the film formation processing while keeping the end portion of the substrate clean by controlling the processing liquid supplier and the processing liquid remover depending on the state of the end portion of the substrate after the film formation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(11) The controller may determine whether the processing liquid does not adhere to the end portion of the substrate as the good state or the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate as the not-good state on the basis of the results of the inspection by the end portion inspection device in the film formation processing unit, to control the processing liquid supplier and the processing liquid remover so as to remove the processing liquid supplied onto the substrate and supply the processing liquid onto the substrate again as the second control operation when the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this case, if the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate after the film formation processing, the processing liquid remover removes the processing liquid on the substrate once, and the processing liquid supplier then subjects the substrate to the film formation processing again. This prevents the substrate from being transported from the film formation processing unit to the exposure device with the processing liquid adhering to the end portion. Therefore, the exposure device is prevented from being contaminated by the processing liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate, to prevent a defective dimension and a defective shape of an exposure pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(12) The controller may determine whether the processing liquid does not adhere to the end portion of the substrate as the good state or the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate as the not-good state on the basis of the results of the inspection by the end portion inspection device in the film formation processing unit, to control the processing liquid remover so as to remove the processing liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate as the second control operation when the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, if the processing liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate after the film formation processing, the processing liquid remover removes the processing liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate. This prevents the substrate from being transported from the film formation processing unit to the exposure device with the processing liquid adhering to the end portion. This prevents the exposure device from being contaminated by the processing liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate, to prevent a defective dimension and a defective shape of an exposure pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(13) The film formation processing unit may include a photosensitive film formation unit that forms a photosensitive film on the substrate. In this case, the photosensitive film can be suitably formed on the substrate while keeping the end portion of the substrate clean.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(14) The film formation processing unit may further include an anti-reflection film formation unit that forms an anti-reflection film on the substrate before the photosensitive film formation unit forms the photosensitive film.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, the anti-reflection film can be suitably formed on the substrate while keeping the end portion of the substrate clean. Furthermore, in the photosensitive film formation unit, the film formation processing can be performed with the end portion of the substrate kept clean, which allows the photosensitive film to be satisfactorily formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(15) The film formation processing unit may further include a protective film formation unit that forms on the substrate a protective film for protecting the photosensitive film formed by the photosensitive film formation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this case, the protective film can be suitably formed on the substrate while keeping the end portion of the substrate clean. This allows the photosensitive film to be sufficiently protected, which can more sufficiently prevent defective processing of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">(16) The substrate processing apparatus may further include a transport device that transports the substrate between the processing section and a plurality of storing containers in accordance with the control operation of the controller, in which the processing unit may include a development processing unit that subjects the substrate after the exposure processing by the exposure device to development processing, the end portion inspection device may inspect the end portion of the substrate after the development processing by the development processing unit, and the controller may determine whether or not the end portion of the substrate is in the good state on the basis of the results of the inspection by the end portion inspection device after the development processing, to control the transport device such that the substrate is stored in one of the plurality of storing containers as the first control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in the good state, while controlling the transport device such that the substrate is stored in the other one of the plurality of storing containers as the second control operation when the end portion of the substrate is in the not-good state.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, the substrate whose end portion is in the good state and the substrate whose end portion is in the not-good state are respectively stored in the separate storing containers, which can prevent the substrate whose end portion is in the not-good state from being fed as it is to the subsequent processing process.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">(A-3) Effect of the First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the first embodiment, the substrate W whose bevel portion is determined to be contaminated in the bevel portion inspection unit EE is not carried into the exposure device <b>16</b>. This prevents contamination in the exposure device <b>16</b> due to contamination of the bevel portion of the substrate W. As a result, a defective dimension and a defective shape of an exposure pattern can be prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The substrate W whose bevel portion is determined to be contaminated in the bevel portion inspection unit EE may be carried into the first cleaning/drying unit SD<b>1</b> again. In this case, the substrate W that has been subjected to the cleaning and drying processing in the first cleaning/drying unit SD<b>1</b> is carried into the bevel portion inspection unit EE again, to inspect whether or not the bevel portion is contaminated. That is, the substrate W is repeatedly subjected to cleaning processing in the first cleaning/drying unit SD<b>1</b> until the bevel portion inspection unit EE determines that the bevel portion is not contaminated. This allows the substrate W to be carried into the exposure device <b>16</b> with the bevel portion kept clean.</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The operation of the coating unit BARC having the above-mentioned configuration will be then described using the drawings. The operation of the coating unit BARC is controlled by the main controller <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a schematic flow chart showing a control operation of the main controller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the main controller <b>30</b> selects a coating liquid supplied to the substrate W in accordance with predetermined processing conditions, and selects the corresponding coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> (step S<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">When the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> is selected, the gripper moving mechanisms <b>834</b> and <b>837</b> respectively cause the nozzle gripper <b>820</b> to come closer to the gripper <b>810</b><i>a </i>in the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> selected with the pair of holding arms <b>821</b> opened.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The gripper <b>810</b><i>a </i>in the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> is held between the holding arms <b>821</b>. Furthermore, the held coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> is lifted upward, and the gripper moving mechanisms <b>834</b> and <b>837</b> move the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> to a predetermined position above the center of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Then, the main controller <b>30</b> discharges a coating liquid from the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> onto the substrate W while causing the spin chuck <b>803</b> to rotate the substrate W, to apply the coating liquid onto the substrate W (step S<b>2</b>). At this time, a rinse liquid is discharged toward a lower surface of the substrate W from a back rinse nozzle (not shown) positioned below the substrate W. This can prevent the coating liquid from adhering to the lower substrate of the substrate W. When the discharge of the coating liquid is terminated, the coating liquid supply nozzle <b>810</b> is returned to a predetermined position of the waiting portion <b>850</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Then, the main controller <b>30</b> moves the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b> to the vicinity of a peripheral portion of the substrate W, and discharges the rinse liquid toward the peripheral portion of the substrate W from the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b> (step S<b>3</b>). This causes the coating liquid that adheres to the peripheral portion of the substrate W to be removed by dissolving. After a predetermined time period has elapsed, the discharge of the rinse liquid from the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b> is stopped, to move the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b> outward from the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Then, the main controller <b>30</b> causes the motor <b>864</b> to move the inspection head <b>30</b> to the vicinity of the end portion of the substrate W.

<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Then, the main controller <b>30</b> determines whether or not the coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W on the basis of the results of the inspection by the inspection head <b>863</b> (step S<b>5</b>). That is, it is determined whether or not the coating liquid adheres to a portion where an anti-reflection film should not be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Specifically, when the intensity of the scattered light of the laser light detected by the inspection head <b>863</b> is within a predetermined range, it is determined that the coating liquid does not adhere to the end portion of the substrate W. On the other hand, when the intensity of the scattered light is outside the predetermined range, it is determined that the coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">When the coating liquid does not adhere to the end portion of the substrate W, the main controller <b>30</b> stops the rotation of the substrate W by the spin chuck <b>803</b>, to cause the first central robot CR<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to carry the substrate W out of the coating unit BARC (step S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">When the coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W, the main controller <b>30</b> causes the nozzle gripper <b>820</b> to move any one of the stripping liquid supply nozzles <b>811</b> to a predetermined position above the center of the substrate W. The main controller <b>30</b> discharges the stripping liquid onto the substrate W from the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> with the rotation of the substrate W maintained (step S<b>7</b>). This causes the coating liquid applied on the substrate W to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Thereafter, the main controller <b>30</b> scatters the coating liquid and the stripping liquid on the substrate W by increasing the rotational speed of the substrate W, and applies the coating liquid on the substrate W again upon returning to the step S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">After the coating unit BARC thus applies the coating liquid for the anti-reflection film on the substrate W, the inspection head <b>863</b> inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate W. When the coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W as a result of the inspection, the coating liquid on the substrate W is removed once, and a coating liquid is applied on the substrate W anew. This allows an anti-reflection film to be formed in a suitable region on the substrate W while keeping the end portion of the substrate W clean.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Note that it is difficult to remove the anti-reflection film from the substrate W after the anti-reflection film on the substrate W is subjected to heat treatment in the thermal processing groups <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> for anti-reflection film and resist film (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The coating unit RES has the same configuration as the coating unit BARC except that a coating liquid for a resist film is used in place of the coating liquid for the anti-reflection film and a stripping liquid for a resist film is used in place of the stripping liquid for the anti-reflection film.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In the coating unit RES, a substrate W is subjected to the same processing as that in the coating unit BARC. Specifically, the coating liquid for the resist film is first applied on the substrate W having an anti-reflection film formed thereon. Then, an inspection head <b>863</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) inspects the state of an end portion of the substrate W.

<p id="p-0284" num="0283">On the other hand, if the coating liquid for the resist film adheres to the end portion of the substrate W, the stripping liquid for the resist film is supplied onto the substrate W.

Thereafter, the coating liquid for the resist film is applied anew on the substrate W, and the inspection head <b>863</b> inspects the end portion of the substrate W again.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">This allows the resist film to be formed in a suitable region on the substrate W while keeping the end portion of the substrate W clean.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">(E-2-3) Coating Unit COV</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The coating unit COV has the same configuration as the coating unit BARC except that a coating liquid for a resist cover film is used in place of the coating liquid for the anti-reflection film and a stripping liquid for a resist cover film is used in place of the stripping liquid for the anti-reflection film.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In the coating unit COV, a substrate W is subjected to the same processing as that in the coating unit BARC.

<p id="p-0291" num="0290">(E-3) Development Processing Unit DEV</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The details of the development processing unit DEV will be then described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a plan view showing the configuration of the development processing unit DEV, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line Q-Q of the development processing unit DEV shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, the development processing unit DEV includes a spin chuck <b>901</b> for holding a substrate W in a horizontal attitude by suction. The spin chuck <b>901</b> is secured to a front end of a rotating shaft <b>903</b> in a motor <b>902</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>), and is rotatable around its vertical axis. A circular inner cup <b>904</b> is movable up and down so as to surround the substrate W around the spin chuck <b>901</b>. A square outer cup <b>905</b> is provided around the inner cup <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Waiting pods <b>906</b> and <b>907</b> are respectively arranged on both sides of the outer cup <b>905</b>, and a guide rail <b>908</b> is disposed on the outer side of one surface of the outer cup <b>905</b>. Furthermore, a nozzle arm <b>909</b> is provided so as to be movable in a scanning direction A and a direction opposite thereto along the guide rail <b>908</b> by an arm driver <b>910</b>. A rinse liquid discharge nozzle <b>912</b> for cleaning that discharges pure water as a rinse liquid for cleaning is provided so as to be rotatable in a direction indicated by an arrow RI on the outer side of the other surface of the outer cup <b>905</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Furthermore, an inspection head <b>920</b> is arranged on the outer side of the other surface of the outer cup <b>905</b>. The inspection head <b>920</b> is attached to a front end of a rotating arm <b>922</b> rotated by a motor <b>921</b>. The inspection head <b>920</b> has the same configuration as the inspection head <b>863</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and irradiates laser light onto an end portion of the substrate W held in the spin chuck <b>901</b> and detects its scattered light to inspect the state of the end portion of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">A development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b> having a slit-shaped discharge port <b>915</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) at its lower end is attached to the nozzle arm <b>909</b> perpendicularly to the guide rail <b>908</b>. A development liquid supplying system (not shown) supplies a development liquid to the development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">When the substrate W is subjected to development processing, the development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b> moves to a position within the outer cup <b>905</b> from the position of the waiting pod <b>906</b>. The development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b> passes above the substrate W in a stationary state while discharging the development liquid. This causes the development liquid to be held on the whole surface of the substrate W so that the development processing progresses. The development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b> moves to a position of the waiting pod <b>907</b>, and then returns to the position of the waiting pod <b>906</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">After an elapse of a predetermined time period, the rinse liquid is discharged onto the substrate W from the rinse liquid discharge nozzle <b>912</b>. This causes the development processing on the substrate W to be stopped. Note that the development liquid discharge nozzle <b>911</b> that has returned to the position of the waiting pod <b>906</b> may move above the substrate W while discharging the rinse liquid to stop the development processing on the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Thereafter, the substrate W is rotated at high speed, so that the development liquid and the rinse liquid on the substrate W are scattered, to dry the substrate W. This causes the development processing for the substrate W to be terminated. After the termination of the development processing, the inspection head <b>920</b> moves to the vicinity of the end portion of the substrate W. The inspection head <b>920</b> inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate W with the substrate W rotated. The results of the inspection by the inspection head <b>920</b> are given to the main controller shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thereafter, the substrate W is carried out of the development processing unit DEV.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">As described above, the substrate W carried out of the development processing unit DEV is stored in the carrier C by the indexer robot IR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the indexer block <b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In the present embodiment, the main controller <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) controls the indexer robot IR on the basis of the results of the inspection by the inspection head <b>920</b> in the development processing unit DEV, so that the substrate W whose end portion is determined to be contaminated and the substrate W whose end portion is determined that it is not contaminated are respectively stored within the separate carriers C.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">(E-4) Effect of Fifth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">In the fifth embodiment, the coating units BARC, RES, and COV respectively coat the substrate W with an anti-reflection film, a resist film, and a resist cover film, and the inspection head <b>863</b> then inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate W. The substrate W is subjected to predetermined processing in accordance with the results of the inspection, to prevent the substrate W from being fed to the subsequent process from the coating units BARC, RES, and COV with the end portion of the substrate W contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Therefore, the substrate W can be carried into the exposure device <b>16</b> with the end portion thereof kept clean. This can prevent contamination in the exposure device <b>16</b> due to contamination of the end portion of the substrate W. As a result, a defective dimension and a defective shape of an exposure pattern can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Furthermore, in each of the coating units, the end portion of the substrate W can be subjected to coating processing in a clean state. Therefore, each of the films can be satisfactorily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In the development processing block DEV, the inspection head <b>920</b> inspects the state of the end portion of the substrate W after development processing. The substrate W whose end portion is determined to be contaminated and the substrate whose end portion is determined that it is not contaminated by the inspection are respectively stored in the separate carriers C. This can prevent the substrate W whose end portion is contaminated from being fed as it is to the subsequent processing process from the substrate processing apparatus <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">(E-5) Modification</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">(E-5-1)</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">In the coating units BARC, RES, and COV in the above-mentioned embodiment, when the coating liquid for the anti-reflection film, the resist film, or the resist cover film adheres to the end portion of the substrate W, the whole coating liquid on the substrate W is removed. However, the present invention is not limited to the same. For example, only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Specifically, only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W can be removed with the coating liquid applied to a suitable region on the substrate W left as it is by supplying the stripping liquid to only the end portion of the substrate W from the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b>. Furthermore, the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W can be also removed by supplying the rinse liquid to the end portion of the substrate W again from the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">(E-5-2)</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">A method of removing a coating liquid may be selected depending on the degree of adhesion of the coating liquid to the end portion of the substrate W. For example, as a result of the inspection by the inspection head <b>863</b>, the whole coating liquid on the substrate W is removed by the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> when the coating liquid significantly adheres to the end portion of the substrate W, and only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W is removed by the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> or the edge rinse nozzle <b>804</b> when the coating liquid slightly adheres to the end portion of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Note that the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> for removing the whole coating liquid on the substrate W and the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> for removing only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W may be separately provided to have different configurations in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">For example, the diameter of a discharge port of the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> for removing only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W is set below the diameter of a discharge port of the stripping liquid supply nozzle <b>811</b> for removing the whole coating liquid on the substrate W. In this case, when the whole coating liquid on the substrate is removed, the stripping liquid can be efficiently supplied to the whole surface of the substrate W. On the other hand, when only the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W is removed, the stripping liquid can be supplied to only the end portion of the substrate W more accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">(E-5-3)</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">In each of the coating units BARC, RES, and COV, a plurality of types of coating liquids are used. A plurality of types of stripping liquids may be used so as to respectively correspond to the plurality of types of coating liquids. Specifically, a plurality of types of stripping liquids that differ from one another are respectively supplied to the plurality of stripping liquid supply nozzles <b>811</b>. When the coating liquid on the substrate W is removed, the stripping liquid that can effectively remove the coating liquid is selected. In this case, the coating liquid on the substrate W can be removed reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">(E-5-4)</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">As respective modifications of the coating units BARC, RES, and COV, the coating unit BARC will be described as an example using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a plan view showing the modification of the coating unit BARC. The difference between the coating unit BARC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and the coating unit BARC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The coating unit BARC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is provided with a cleaning brush <b>870</b> for cleaning an end portion of a substrate W. The cleaning brush <b>870</b> is held by a holding arm <b>871</b>, and the holding arm <b>871</b> is driven by a driving mechanism (not shown). This causes the cleaning brush <b>870</b> to move in the direction nearer to or away from the end portion of the substrate W held in a spin chuck <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In the coating unit BARC, when a coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W as a result of inspection by an inspection head <b>863</b>, the cleaning brush <b>870</b> cleans the end portion of the substrate W. This allows the coating liquid that adheres to the end portion of the substrate W to be removed with the coating liquid applied to a suitable region on the substrate W maintained as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Even when the cleaning brush <b>870</b> is provided in the coating units RES and COV, the same function and effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Note that the bevel cleaners <b>530</b>, <b>560</b>, and <b>570</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> may be also respectively provided in the coating units BARC, RES, and COV.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">(E-5-5)</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In the fifth embodiment, when it is determined as a result of the inspection by the inspection head <b>863</b> that the coating liquid adheres to the end portion of the substrate W in the coating units BARC, RES, and COV, only the coating liquid applied within the common coating unit is removed. In the coating units RES and COV, however, all the films formed on the substrate W may be removed. In this case, the substrate W is returned to the coating unit BARC from the coating units RES or COV, and films are formed anew, beginning with an anti-reflection film, on the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">(E-5-6)</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Although in the fifth embodiment, each of the coating units BARC, RES, and COV is provided with the inspection head <b>863</b>, only one or two types of the coating units BARC, RES, and COV may be provided with the inspection head <b>863</b>, provided that the end portion of the substrate W can be kept clean.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">(E-5-7)</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">The removal unit REM may be provided with the same inspection device as the inspection heads <b>865</b> and <b>920</b>. In this case, the state of the end portion of the substrate W is inspected after the substrate W is subjected to resist cover film removal processing, and the substrate W whose end portion is determined to be contaminated is subjected to resist cover film removal processing again.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">This prevents the substrate W from being fed to the subsequent process with a residue of the resist cover film adhering to the end portion thereof. Therefore, the development processing in the development processing unit DEV can be satisfactorily performed.</p>
