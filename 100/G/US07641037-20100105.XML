<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to subject matter contained in Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-225750 filed on Aug. 22, 2006, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bill handling apparatus for feeding a bill inserted from a bill insertion slot, while reading the fed bill to identify the validity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, a bill handling apparatus identifies the validity of a bill inserted from a bill insertion slot by a user, and is incorporated into service apparatuses that provides various kinds of products and service corresponding to the bill value judged as being valid, such as, for example, a game media lending machine installed in a game hole, or an automatic dispenser, ticket-vending machine and the like installed in public areas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The bill handling apparatus is usually provided with operation devices such as a bill feeding mechanism that feeds a bill inserted into a bill insertion slot, bill reading means for executing readout of the fed bill, bill identifying means for identifying the validity (also referred to as authentication judgment) from the read bill information and the like, and control means for driving and controlling the operation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-mentioned bill reading means is provided with a photosensor which applies light to the fed bill and detects the reflected light and/or transmitted light, and the bill identifying means compares a detection signal from the photosensor with beforehand stored authorized bill data to identify the validity. For the above-mentioned photosensor, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. H10-31774, it is known that the sensor unit is configured as a unit, and that the sensor unit is electrically connected to a connector on a control board side via a relay harness. In other words, by such a configuration, it is possible to perform maintenance operation with ease in the event of failure and like, and to cope with bogus bills simply by exchanging only the sensor unit and a microchip computer on the control board side.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, since the conventional bill handling apparatus uses the relay harness and connector in connection between the sensor unit and control board, a problem easily occurs that the relay harness comes into contact with the control board or another component and causes a short and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, to avoid such a problem, the necessity arises for providing footprints of the sensor unit and control board with margins, but as a result, another problem occurs that the entire bill handling apparatus is increased in size.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a bill handling apparatus is required that enables miniaturization of the entire apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above-mentioned object, a bill handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterized by having a bill insertion slot into which a bill is inserted, a bill feeding mechanism for feeding the bill inserted from the bill insertion slot, a sensor for reading the fed bill, and a bill identifying section for identifying authentication of the bill read by the sensor, and further comprising a sensor board on which the sensor is installed, a control board for controlling each operation of the bill feeding mechanism, the sensor and the bill identifying section, a first connector installed on the sensor board, and a second connector installed on the control board, where the first connector and the second connector are fitted with each other for electrical continuity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</p>

The bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> is comprised of, for example, an optical type sensor, more specifically, a regression reflective photosensor, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, formed of a prism <b>18</b><i>a </i>installed on the upper frame <b>2</b>A side and a sensor body <b>18</b><i>b </i>installed on the lower frame <b>2</b>B side. More specifically, the prism <b>18</b><i>a </i>and sensor body <b>18</b><i>b </i>are arranged in such a manner that light emitted from a light-emitting portion <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the sensor body <b>18</b><i>b </i>is detected by a light-receiving portion <b>18</b><i>d </i>of the sensor body <b>18</b><i>b </i>thorough the prism <b>18</b><i>a</i>. When a bill is passed through the bill feeding path <b>5</b> positioned between the prism <b>18</b><i>a </i>and sensor body <b>18</b><i>b </i>and the light is not detected in the light-receiving portion <b>18</b><i>d</i>, the sensor <b>18</b> generates a detection signal.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the downstream side of the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> is installed the bill reading means <b>20</b> for reading the bill information on the bill in a fed state. The bill reading means <b>20</b> is only required to have a configuration for irradiating the bill with the light to read the bill information when the bill is fed by the bill feeding mechanism <b>8</b>, and generating a signal to enable the validity (authentication) of the bill to be judged, and in this embodiment, is configured to perform readout of the bill by applying the light from the opposite sides, and detecting the transmitted light and reflected light by a light-receiving device such as a photodiode or the like. Then, the optical signal on the read bill information undergoes photoelectric transformation, and is compared with the beforehand stored data of the authorized bill in the bill identifying section, and the authentication of the fed bill is thus judged.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the downstream side of the bill insertion slot <b>6</b> is disposed the shutter mechanism <b>50</b> that blocks the bill insertion slot <b>6</b>. The shutter mechanism <b>50</b> is configured to be normally in a state for opening the bill insertion slot <b>6</b>, closed when a bill is inserted and the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> detects a rear end of the bill (the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> is OFF), and thus prevent fraud and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, the shutter mechanism <b>50</b> has the rotating pieces <b>52</b> that are rotatably driven to appear at predetermined intervals in the direction perpendicular to the bill feeding direction in the bill feeding path <b>5</b>, and a solenoid (pull-type) <b>54</b> that is a driving source that rotatably drives the rotating pieces <b>52</b>. In this case, the rotating pieces <b>52</b> are installed in two locations in the width direction of a spindle <b>55</b>, and long holes <b>5</b><i>c </i>extending in the bill feeding direction are formed in the bill feeding face <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the lower frame <b>2</b>B constituting the bill feeding path <b>5</b> to cause respective rotating pieces <b>52</b> to appear.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, on the downstream side of the bill reading means <b>20</b> is provided a bill passage detecting sensor <b>60</b> that detects passage of the bill. The bill passage detecting sensor <b>60</b> is to generate a detection signal when the bill judged as being valid is further fed to the downstream side, and the sensor <b>60</b> detects the rear end of the bill. Based on the occurrence of the detection signal, the energization of the solenoid <b>54</b> is released (the solenoid is OFF), and the driving shaft <b>54</b><i>a </i>moves in the protruding direction by the biasing force of the biasing spring provided in the driving shaft <b>54</b><i>a</i>. By this means, the rotating pieces <b>52</b> constituting the shutter mechanism are rotatably driven to open the bill feeding path via the spindle <b>55</b> synchronized with the driving shaft <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bill passage detecting sensor <b>60</b> is, as in the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b>, comprised of an optical type sensor (regression reflective photosensor), and formed of a prism <b>60</b><i>a </i>installed on the upper frame <b>2</b>A side and a sensor body <b>60</b><i>b </i>installed on the lower frame <b>2</b>B side.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the vicinity of the bill insertion slot <b>6</b> is provided an informing device that informs that the bill is being inserted in a visible manner. Such an informing device can be comprised of, for example, an LED <b>70</b> that blinks, is lit when a user inserts a bill in the bill insertion slot <b>6</b>, and informs the user of the bill being handled. It is thereby possible to prevent the user from erroneously inserting a next bill.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref> and <b>7</b>, described below is the configuration of the bill reading means <b>20</b> installed in the upper frame <b>2</b>A and lower frame <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The bill reading means <b>20</b> has a light-emitting unit <b>24</b> provided with a first light-emitting portion <b>23</b> that is disposed on the upper frame <b>2</b>A side and that is capable of emitting slit-shaped light over the feeding path width direction on the upper side of the fed bill, and a line sensor <b>25</b> disposed on the lower frame <b>2</b>B side.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The line sensor <b>25</b> installed on the lower frame <b>2</b>B side has a light-receiving portion <b>26</b> disposed opposite to the first light-emitting portion <b>23</b> in a manner of sandwiching the bill, and second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> that are disposed adjacent to opposite sides of the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> on the bill feeding direction and that are capable of emitting slit-shaped light.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first light-emitting portion <b>23</b> disposed opposite to the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> of the line sensor <b>25</b> functions as a light source for transmission. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first light-emitting portion <b>23</b> is formed as the so-called light guide member <b>23</b><i>b </i>made of a synthetic resin formed in the shape of a rectangle rod, and preferably, has functions of receiving emitted light from the light-emitting device <b>23</b><i>a </i>such as an LED and the like installed at the end portion, and emitting the light while guiding the light along the longitudinal direction. By this means, it is possible to apply the slit-shaped light uniformly to the entire region in the width direction of the feeding path of the fed bill with a simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> of the line sensor <b>25</b> is disposed in the shape of a line in parallel with the first light-emitting portion <b>23</b> that is the light guide member, and formed in the shape of a thin plate which extends in the direction of intersecting the bill feeding path <b>5</b>, and which is formed in the shape of a band having a width to the extent of not affecting the sensitivity of a light-receiving sensor, not shown, provided in the light-receiving portion <b>26</b>. More specifically, the portion <b>26</b> has a configuration where a plurality of CCDs (Charge Coupled Device) is provided in the shape of a line in the center in the thickness direction of the light-receiving portion <b>26</b>, and a Selfoc lens array <b>26</b><i>a </i>is arranged in the shape of a line in a position above the CCDs to gather the transmitted light and reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> of the line sensor <b>25</b> function as light sources for reflection. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> is formed, as in the first light-emitting portion <b>23</b>, as the so-called light guide member <b>27</b><i>b </i>made of a synthetic resin formed in the shape of a rectangle rod, and preferably, has functions of receiving emitted light from the light-emitting device <b>27</b><i>a </i>such as an LED and the like installed at the end portion, and emitting the light while guiding the light along the longitudinal direction. By this means, it is possible to apply the slit-shaped light uniformly to the entire region in the width direction of the feeding path of the fed bill with a simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, each of the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> is capable of applying the light to the bill at an elevation angle of 45 degrees, and is disposed so that the reflected light from the bill is received in the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> (light-receiving sensor). In this case, the light emitted from the second light-emitting portion <b>27</b> is input to the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> at an angle of 45 degrees, but the incident angle is not limited to 45 degrees, and can be set as appropriate in ranges capable of reliably receiving the reflected light. Therefore, an arrangement of the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> and second light-receiving portion <b>26</b> can be modified in design as appropriate corresponding to the configuration of the bill handling apparatus. Further, the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> are installed on the opposite sides with the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> sandwiched therebetween to emit the light from the opposite sides respectively at an angle of 45 degrees. This is because when a tear, crease and the like are present on the bill surface and the light is applied to a concavo-convex portion caused by a portion of the tear, crease or the like from only one side, a shaded area may be caused in the concavo-convex portion by shielding the light. Therefore, by emitting the light from the opposite sides, it is possible to prevent the concavo-convex portion from being darkened, and to obtain image data with higher accuracy than in emission from one side. Naturally, the second light-emitting portion <b>27</b> may be configured to be installed on only one side.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The line sensor <b>25</b> is exposed to the bill feeding path <b>5</b>, and is thereby provided with concavo-convex portions <b>25</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, on opposite ends of its surface portion (that is substantially the same plane as the feeding face <b>3</b><i>a</i>) in the bill feeding direction to catch the fed bill hardly. Further, as in the line sensor <b>25</b>, the light emitting unit <b>24</b> is provided with concavo-convex portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, on opposite ends of its surface portion in the bill feeding direction to catch the fed bill hardly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The line sensor <b>25</b> is provided with the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> extending in the width direction of the bill feeding path and the light-receiving portion <b>26</b>, and is mounted on a sensor board <b>25</b>A installed with a circuit that causes the second light-emitting portions <b>27</b> to emit light, a detecting circuit that detects the light incident upon the CCDs provided in line-shape to constitute the light-receiving portion <b>26</b>, an amplifier that amplifies an output of the detecting circuit, an A/D converter that converts the amplified output signal into a digital signal, a control section that controls these kinds of devices, and the like. The sensor board <b>25</b>A is attached to a hold frame <b>25</b>B in the shape of a substantially rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sensor board <b>25</b>A is electrically connected to a control board <b>100</b> that controls the entire apparatus. In this case, both the boards are arranged opposite to each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, and the sensor board <b>25</b>A is fixed to a predetermined position in the lower frame <b>2</b>B by screwing screws <b>80</b> into screw holes respectively formed in four corner portions of the hold frame <b>25</b>B, while being attached to the hold frame <b>25</b>B. Meanwhile, the control board <b>100</b> is fixed to a predetermined position in the lower frame <b>2</b>B by screwing screws <b>82</b> into screw holes respectively formed in four corner portions, while causing a predetermined clearance with the sensor board <b>25</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sensor board <b>25</b>A and control board <b>100</b> are respectively provided with the first connector <b>25</b>C and second connector <b>100</b>C to electrically connect both the boards. The connectors <b>25</b>C and <b>100</b>C are concave and convex connectors protruding in the perpendicular direction to the board plane to be fitted with each other in installing both the boards, and more specifically, are comprised of stacking connectors so as to increase the number of connection poles. In other words, with the sensor board <b>25</b>A fixed to the predetermined position of the lower frame <b>2</b>B, the second connector <b>100</b>C of the control board <b>100</b> is fitted into the first connector <b>25</b>C of the sensor board <b>25</b>A, the control board <b>100</b> is fixed to the lower frame <b>2</b>B in this state, and both the connectors are thereby electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, in the above-mentioned configuration, an opening <b>3</b>D is formed in the side wall portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>constituting the frame so that the line sensor <b>25</b> slides into the opening and is capable of being installed inside. This opening <b>3</b>D is configured in a similar shape to that of the side face portion of the sensor board <b>25</b>A installed with the line sensor <b>25</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is formed in a substantially convex shape. In other words, it is made possible to cause the sensor board <b>25</b>A installed with the line sensor <b>25</b> to slide to be installed in a predetermined position of the lower frame <b>2</b>B, as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, through the opening <b>3</b>D while being attached to the hold frame <b>25</b>B in the shape of a substantially rectangle. Then, the size of the opening <b>3</b>D is configured to enable the connection state of the first connector <b>25</b>C and the second connector <b>100</b>C to be visually identified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in electrically connecting the sensor board <b>25</b>A and control board <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ROM <b>112</b> stores operation programs for driving apparatuses such as the driving motor <b>10</b>, solenoid <b>54</b>, LED <b>70</b> and the like, various kinds of programs such as an authentication judgment program and the like, and permanently data. The CPU <b>110</b> operates according to the programs stored in the ROM <b>112</b>, inputs and outputs signals to/from the driving apparatuses as described above via an I/O port <b>120</b>, and controls the operation of the bill handling apparatus. In other words, the CPU <b>110</b> is connected to a driving motor driving circuit <b>125</b> (driving motor <b>10</b>), solenoid <b>54</b>, and LED <b>70</b> via the I/O port <b>120</b>. The driving apparatuses are controlled in operation by control signals from the CPU <b>110</b> according to the operation programs stored in the ROM <b>112</b>. Further, the CPU <b>110</b> receives a detection signal from the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b>, and a detection signal from the bill passage detecting sensor <b>60</b> via the I/O port <b>120</b>, and based on these detection signals, controls forward/reverse driving of the driving motor <b>10</b>, blinking of the LED <b>70</b>, and driving of the solenoid <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The RAM <b>114</b> stores the data and programs used for the CPU <b>110</b> to operate, and acquires the received light data of a bill targeted for judgment to temporarily store. The data is compared with the reference data stored in the reference data storage section <b>116</b>, and the authentication judgment processing is thereby performed. In addition, in this embodiment, the reference data is stored in the dedicated reference data storage section <b>116</b>, but may be stored in the ROM <b>112</b>. Further, although the reference data of the genuine bill may be stored beforehand in the reference data storage section <b>116</b>, for example, the genuine bill is fed through the bill feeding mechanism <b>8</b> to acquire the received light data, and the data may be stored as the reference data.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the CPU <b>110</b> is connected to the first light-emitting portion (light guide member) <b>23</b> in the light-emitting unit <b>24</b>, and the light-receiving portion <b>26</b> and second light-emitting portions (light guide members) <b>27</b> in the line sensor <b>25</b> via the I/O port <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the CPU <b>110</b> is connected to a control section of the game media lending apparatus into which the bill handling apparatus <b>1</b> is incorporated, and an upper apparatus <b>200</b> such as a host computer and the like of an external apparatus, via the I/O port <b>120</b>, and transmits various kinds of signals (such as information of the bill, alarm signal and the like) to the upper apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the bill handling apparatus configured as described above, when the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> detects insertion of a bill and becomes ON, the driving motor <b>10</b> is forward driven, and the LED <b>70</b> is lit. The feeding roller pairs <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are thereby driven to rotate in the bill insertion direction to feed the bill inside the apparatus, and the user is notified of the bill being handled to prevent insertion of an additional bill.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The bill is fed inside the apparatus, the bill reading means <b>20</b> thereby reads the information, and the control means <b>30</b> executes the authentication judgment processing. At this point, in this embodiment, when the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> detects the rear end of the bill (the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b> is OFF), the solenoid <b>54</b> is energized, and the rotating pieces <b>52</b> are thereby driven to rotate and block the bill insertion slot <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the bill is judged as being genuine in the above-mentioned authentication judgment processing, the bill is further fed to the downstream side. At this point, to be able to support money-back processing and the like that would occur due to some reason, the processing for causing the bill to temporarily wait may be performed. Then, in the stage where the rear end of the bill further fed to the downstream side is detected by the bill passage detecting sensor <b>60</b>, the driving of the driving motor <b>10</b> is halted. With the halt, the driving of the solenoid <b>54</b> is made OFF (energization is canceled) to withdraw the rotating pieces <b>52</b> from the bill feeding path <b>5</b>, the bill insertion opening <b>6</b> is opened, and the LED <b>70</b> is extinguished.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, when the bill is judged being not genuine in the above-mentioned authentication judgment processing, the processing for driving the driving motor <b>10</b> reversely is executed in this stage, the shutter mechanism <b>50</b> is opened, and the bill is sent back toward the bill insertion opening side. In this send-back processing, in the stage where the rear end of the bill is detecting by the bill detecting sensor <b>18</b>, the LED <b>70</b> is extinguished.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the bill handling apparatus <b>1</b> configured as described above, the sensor board <b>25</b>A installed with the line sensor <b>25</b> for reading the bill is connected electrically to the control board <b>100</b> side by the first connector and second connector (stacking connectors) when arranged opposite to the control board <b>100</b> without through the relay harness unlike in the conventional apparatus, the need is thereby eliminated of providing unnecessary occupied space between both the boards, and it is possible to miniaturize the bill handling apparatus <b>1</b>. In other words, the need is eliminated of providing a clearance (to the extent that the relay harness does not come into contact with the boards and mounted parts) corresponding to the relay harness in between both the board, the boards can be brought into closer to each other corresponding to the eliminated clearance, and it is thereby possible to miniaturize the entire apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in the above-mentioned configuration, the opening <b>3</b>D is formed in the side wall portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the lower frame <b>2</b>B to enable the line sensor <b>25</b> and sensor board <b>25</b>A to be slid and installed therein and further enable the first connector <b>25</b>C and second connector <b>100</b>C to be identified visually, and it is made possible to easily perform the operating for electrically connecting the sensor board <b>25</b>A to the control board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, it is preferable that the first connector <b>25</b>C and second connector <b>100</b>C are installed in the positions near the opening <b>3</b>D as close as possible, in other words, in the positions enabling the connection state to be visually identified with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In such as configuration, since the connection part of the connectors can be visually identified, it is possible to connect the connectors between the control board <b>100</b> and the sensor board <b>25</b>A with easy, and since the connector parts are installed in a portion near the opening <b>3</b>D, it is possible to prevent dust from entering from the opening <b>3</b>D. Further, both the boards can be seen hardly from the opening <b>3</b>D, and it is thus possible to improve security.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the foregoing, the embodiment of the invention is described, but it is a feature of the invention making electrical connection between the sensor board of the sensor constituting the bill reading means and the control board for controlling the entire apparatus by the first connector and the second connector without using the relay harness unlike in the conventional apparatus, and the other configurations are capable of being modified as appropriate. For example, the configuration and arrangement pattern of the reading means (sensor) for reading a bill, method of reading the bill, method of performing the bill authentication judgment processing and the like are not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and are capable of being carried into practice with various modifications thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The bill handling apparatus of the invention is capable of being incorporated into various kinds of apparatuses that provide products and/or service by inserting a bill, while being not limited to a game media lending apparatus. Further, this embodiment describes the apparatus for handling bills as an example, but the invention is applicable to apparatuses for making an authentication judgment on gold certificates, securities and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
