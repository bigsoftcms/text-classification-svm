<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a spot welding inspecting apparatus which is mounted in a spot welding gun and capable of inspecting a welded portion by an ultrasonic sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">In spot welding, a weld metal molten and solidified at a contact portion of, for example, two sheets of steel plates after welding is referred to as a nugget. A bonding strength of a welded portion is evaluated by a nugget diameter indicating a size of the nugget.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In inspecting after welding, as an apparatus of measuring the nugget diameter utilizing a nondestructive inspection method, there is proposed an electrode including an ultrasonic probe at inside thereof (refer to, for example, Patent Reference 1).</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">[Patent Reference 1] JP-T-2005-527374 (FIG. 1, FIG. 2)</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Patent Reference 1 will be explained in reference to the following drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">FIG. 15 is a view for explaining a basic constitution of a related art. A welding electrode 100 is constituted by a shaft 102, an ultrasonic probe 106, a probe holder 107, a cooling water pipe 108, and a signal line 109. The shaft 102 has a hollow shape and is attached with a welding cap 101 at a front end thereof. The ultrasonic probe 106 is mounted in the welding cap 101 and a front end portion 105 of the shaft 102 by way of a connection pad 104 placed at an inner bottom portion 103 of the welding cap 101. The probe holder 107 holds the ultrasonic probe 106 from a rear side and is inserted into the shaft 102.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">The cooling water pipe 108 extends from the probe holder 107 and is inserted into the shaft 102. The signal line 109 extends from a rear end of the ultrasonic probe 106 to an upper side of the drawing and is inserted into the probe holder 107 and the cooling water pipe 108.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">According to the welding electrode 100 of Patent Reference 1, as shown by arrow marks, cooling water flows from a rear end portion 111 of the cooling water pipe 108. The cooling water passes a periphery of the ultrasonic probe 106 by way of an inner portion of the probe holder 107. The cooling water changes a flowing direction at the inner bottom portion of the welding cap 101. Then, the cooling water flows along the periphery of the ultrasonic probe 106 and a partition plate 112 attached to a lower portion of the probe holder 107. Finally, the cooling water flows out from a rear end portion 113 of the shaft 102 in the hollow shape as indicated by arrow marks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The welding electrode 100 can be cooled by the flow of the cooling water.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The inventors have carried out spot welding by using a welding electrode having a structure of the welding electrode 100 of Patent Reference 1, and tried to inspect a bonding portion immediately thereafter. As a result thereof, the cooling water flowing at an inner portion of the welding electrode 100 flows deviatedly in a constant direction to be along the partition plate 112. Therefore, it has been found that cooling of the welding cap 101 is deviated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The cooling water at the inner portion of the welding electrode 100 is divided in two to a side (cool water side) in which cooling is positively carried out by passing the cooling water and a side (warm water side) in which the cooling water is not supplied sufficiently and cooling becomes insufficient by receiving heat from the welded portion. Therefore, the ultrasonic probe 106 is dipped to both sides of the cool water side and the warm water side. So, there is a concern of bringing about a deterioration in a measurement accuracy and a reduction in a durability by thermal shock in the ultrasonic probe 106 by heat transmitted from the warm water side.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In addition thereto, in FIG. 2 of Patent Reference 1, according to the welding electrode, a pad 16 and a welding cap 12 are brought into close contact with each other by pressing a probe 14 by a spring element. However, there is a case in which the pad 16 and the welding cap 12 are insufficiently brought into close contact with each other to hamper transmission of an ultrasonic signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">one or more embodiments of the invention provide a spot welding inspecting apparatus capable of nondeviatedly cooling a gun chip and capable of realizing to stabilize measurement of an ultrasonic sensor and a reduction in thermal shock to the ultrasonic sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">Moreover, one or more embodiments of the invention provide a spot welding inspecting apparatus capable of promoting a stability of transmission of an ultrasonic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, a spot welding inspecting apparatus is provided with: a gun chip fitted to one end of an outer cylinder of a spot welding gun; a signal transmitting part mounted in the gun chip and configured to transmit a signal; an ultrasonic sensor having a cylindrical shape, one end of the ultrasonic sensor being brought into contact with the signal transmitting part; an inner cylinder inserted to the outer cylinder and holding the ultrasonic sensor; a through hole provided on the inner cylinder; a partitioning cylinder surrounding the through hole and inserted into a gap between the ultrasonic sensor and the outer cylinder, a front end of the partitioning cylinder reaching the signal transmitting part; a first flow path formed between the inner cylinder and the partitioning cylinder by passing the through hole from an inner portion of the inner cylinder; a second flow path formed at the gun chip to be circulated around a front end of the partitioning cylinder; and a third flow path formed between the outer cylinder and the partitioning cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">In the spot welding inspecting apparatus, the first, second and third flow paths are configured so that a cooling agent flows in an order of the first flow path, the second flow path and the third flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">In the embodiments, the spot welding inspecting apparatus is constituted such that the cooling agent can be made to flow in an order of the first flow path, the second flow path and the third flow path. The first flow path is formed between the inner cylinder and the partitioning cylinder. The second flow path is formed at the gun chip in the cap-like shape to be circulated around a front end of the partitioning cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">The third flow path is formed between the outer cylinder and the partitioning cylinder. As a result, there is not present a large obstacle for disturbing a flow in circumferential directions and longitudinal directions of the first flow path, the second flow path and the third flow path.

<p id="p-0048" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the spot welding inspecting apparatus of the first exemplary embodiment. The spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> is constituted by the outer cylinder <b>12</b> constituting an outlook constituting member of a spot welding gun and including a first male screw portion <b>11</b> formed by, for example, a taper screw at an outer face of a front end portion, the gun chip <b>16</b> in a cap-like shape including a first female screw portion <b>13</b> formed by, for example, a taper screw capable of being screwed to the first male screw portion <b>11</b> at an inner face of a rear end portion, including a second female screw portion <b>14</b> at a middle portion of the inner face and including a heat conducting groove <b>15</b> formed in a lower direction of the drawing from the second female screw portion <b>14</b>, the signal transmitting part <b>19</b> (details of which will be described later) made of a resin mounted to a projected portion <b>17</b> provided at a middle portion of the inner face of the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape and including a second male screw portion <b>18</b> capable of being screwed to the second female screw portion <b>14</b>, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape a front end <b>22</b> of which is brought into close contact with a rear end face <b>21</b> of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b> by way of, for example, an adhering agent, the inner cylinder <b>26</b> inserted to the outer cylinder <b>12</b> for holding the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> having a cylindrical shape and including a plurality of pieces of fixing projections <b>25</b> . . . ( . . . designate a plurality of pieces. The same as follows) at a middle portion and a rear end portion to be brought into contact with an inner face <b>24</b> of the outer cylinder <b>12</b>, a plurality of through holes <b>27</b> . . . (details of which will be described later) provided at a front end portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b> made of glass which surrounds the through holes <b>27</b> . . . and in which a front end <b>28</b> inserted to a gap between the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> of the cylindrical shape and the outer cylinder <b>12</b> reaches the signal transmitting part <b>19</b> and a rear end portion <b>29</b> is fitted to a projected portion <b>31</b> provided at a front end portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">Further, the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> is constituted to include a first flow path <b>35</b> passing the through holes <b>27</b> . . . from an inner portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and formed between the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, a second flow path <b>36</b> formed at the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape to circular around the front end <b>28</b> of the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, and a third flow path <b>37</b> formed between the outer cylinder <b>12</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b> to be able to make the cooling water as, for example, a cooling agent flow in an order of the first flow path <b>35</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b>, and the third flow path <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">Numeral <b>38</b> designates a cable extended from the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> of the cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">Further, although the first male screw portion <b>11</b> and the first female screw portion <b>13</b> are formed by the taper screws, the first male screw portion <b>11</b> and the first female screw portion <b>13</b> may be constituted by parallel screws, and therefore, the first male screw portion <b>11</b> and the first female screw portion <b>13</b> may be changed to other kinds of screws.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">Further, although the adhering agent is used for integrating the signal transmitting part <b>19</b> and the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> of the cylindrical shape, a contact portion thereof may be constituted to be coupled by a screw, and therefore, the integration may be changed to other coupling method.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the signal transmitting portion <b>19</b> includes three pieces of support portions <b>39</b> . . . lower portions of which are formed by a cylindrical shape and upper portions of which are trifurcated. Upper faces of three pieces of the support portions <b>39</b> . . . are respectively formed with fixing grooves <b>41</b>, and the fixing screws <b>41</b> are fitted with the front end <b>28</b> of the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">The inner cylinder <b>26</b>, the holding cylinder <b>34</b> and the cable <b>38</b> are inserted to the outer cylinder <b>12</b>. The inner cylinder <b>16</b> includes, for example, 3 piece of fixing projections <b>25</b> . . . projected from an outer face of the inner cylinder <b>26</b> to an inner face of the outer cylinder <b>12</b>. Therefore, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor (notation <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the cylindrical shape can stably be held without being moved in an up and down direction and in a left and right direction of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">Thereby, a positional shift of the reflection type ultrasonic sensor in the cylindrical shape can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">Further, although an explanation has been given by constituting a number of pieces of the fixing projections <b>25</b> . . . by three pieces, the number of pieces may be changed by outer diameters of the outer cylinder <b>12</b> and the inner cylinder <b>16</b> and the number of pieces is not limited to three pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">Further, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, also with regard to the fixing projections <b>25</b> . . . provided at a middle portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, a similar effect can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">The partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and the cable <b>38</b> are inserted to the outer cylinder <b>12</b>. The inner cylinder <b>26</b> includes, for example, three pieces of the through holes <b>27</b> . . . constituted by penetrating a wall thickness of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>. Therefore, when the cooling water flows in from a head direction to a tail direction of the drawing of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, the cooling water can be made to flow to be dispersed from three pieces of the through holes <b>27</b> . . . to the first flow path <b>35</b>. Thereby, the cooling water can be prevented from flowing deviatedly in a constant direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">Further, although an explanation has been given by constituting a number of pieces of the through holes <b>27</b> . . . by three pieces, the number of pieces may be changed by outer diameters of the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b> and the number of pieces are not limited to three pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory view of attaching the spot welding inspecting apparatus according to the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">A spot welding gun <b>42</b> is constituted by a C type frame <b>44</b> attached to a front end of a robot arm <b>43</b>, a fixing side holder <b>46</b> provided to a lower side finger portion <b>45</b> of the C type frame <b>44</b>, a fixing side electrode chip <b>47</b> attached to the fixing side holder <b>46</b>, a cylinder unit <b>49</b> provided to an upper side finger portion <b>48</b> of the C type frame <b>44</b>, a movable side holder <b>52</b> attached to a cylinder rod <b>51</b> of the cylinder unit <b>49</b>, and the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> attached to the movable side cylinder <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">In the drawing, a nugget diameter after welding is measured by the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> in a state of squeezing two sheets of steel plates <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> laminated by the fixing side electrode chip <b>47</b> and the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">Numeral <b>55</b> designates a support member of the cylinder unit, numerals <b>56</b>, <b>56</b> designate work holders.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">An operation of the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> constituted by the above-described constitution will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view enlarging portion <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A nugget <b>57</b> is formed at a contact face of the steel plate <b>53</b> and the steel plate <b>54</b> laminated together after finishing to weld. By continuously supplying cooling water to the inner cylinder <b>26</b> as shown by arrow marks, the cooling water flows from the inner portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, passes the through holes <b>27</b> . . . , flows in an order of the first flow path <b>36</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b> and the third flow path <b>37</b> and continuously flows out from the outer cylinder <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">When the nugget diameter is measured under the state, an ultrasonic signal is shot from the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape to the nugget <b>57</b> by way of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>. The ultrasonic signal is reflected by a reflecting face provided at the fixed side electrode chip <b>47</b> and a reflecting wave is received by the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">The nugget diameter can be predicted from information of the provided reflecting wave.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">In measuring the nugget diameter, a flow of cooling water is not deviated by the first flow path <b>35</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b> and the third flow path <b>37</b>, and therefore, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape can always be dipped in the cooling water. Therefore, stable measurement can be realized without bringing about an erroneous operation or the like in measuring.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">Further, when the cooling water flows through the second flow path <b>36</b>, the cooling water passes the heat conducting groove <b>15</b>. The heat conducting groove <b>15</b> is formed in a ring-like shape in view of a section provided by cutting the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape in head and tail direction of the drawing, and therefore, the flow of the cooling water is not deviated. Further, the heat conducting groove <b>15</b> is formed to be dug down deeply to the inner face of the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape, and therefore, cold by the cooling water is made to be easy to be conducted to the front end portion of the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape. Thereby, two sheets of the steel plates <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> can firmly be cooled, and therefore, the cold amounts to stabilize to form the nugget <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">Therefore, the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b> is constituted to be able to make the cooling water flow in the order of the first flow path <b>35</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b> and the third flow path <b>37</b>. The first flow path <b>35</b> is formed at the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape to circulate between the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b> is formed to circulate around the front end <b>28</b> of the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, the third flow path <b>37</b> is formed between the outer cylinder <b>12</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b>, respectively, and there is not present a large obstacle of disturbing the flow in circumferential directions and longitudinal directions of the first flow path <b>35</b>, the second flow path <b>36</b> and the third flow path <b>37</b>. The flow of the cooling water is not deviated in a constant direction, and therefore, the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape can undeviatedly cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0071">Further, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape is held by the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, and the cooling water is made to flow from the inner portion of the inner cylinder <b>26</b> to the first flow path <b>35</b> formed between the inner cylinder <b>26</b> and the partitioning cylinder <b>32</b> by passing the through holes <b>27</b> . . . . That is, the cooling water flowing through the first flow path <b>35</b> is always brought into contact with the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> provided below the inner cylinder <b>26</b>, and therefore, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> does not undergo a temperature change by warm water. Therefore, the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape is stabilized in the measurement and is less deteriorated by thermal shock.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0072">As described above, the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like can undeviatedly cooled, and stabilization of measurement by the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape and a reduction in thermal shock to the ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0073">Next, an example of changing a material of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b> included in the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view of an modified example of the first exemplary embodiment. Notations are also used for constitutions common to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and an explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">In a spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b>B, a flat face <b>58</b> is provided at an inner face of a gun chip <b>16</b>B in a cap-like shape. A signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B made of copper is mounted to the flat face <b>58</b>. Since the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B is made of copper, cold of the cooling water is facilitated to be transmitted to the gun chip <b>16</b>B in the cap-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076">Further, the gun chip <b>16</b>B in the cap-like shape does not need to be grooved in contrast to the gun chip <b>16</b> in the cap-like shape since the flat face <b>58</b> is provided. Therefore, working expense can be reduced, and therefore, the constitution contributes to low price formation of the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view enlarging the gun chip in the cap-like shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, notations are used for constitutions common to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and an explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0078">The signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B made of copper is provided with a second male screw portion <b>18</b>B to be engaged with a screw portion <b>14</b>B provided at an inner peripheral face of the gun chip <b>16</b>B in the cap-like shape at an outer peripheral face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0079">Therefore, a degree of bringing the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B and the gun chip <b>16</b>B into close contact with each other is promoted, and therefore, there can be provided the spot welding inspecting apparatus <b>16</b>B capable of promoting a stability of transmitting the ultrasonic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0080">Further, the signal transmitting part <b>10</b>B does not hamper transmission of the ultrasonic signal transmitted from the reflection type ultrasonic sensor <b>23</b> in the cylindrical shape since a rear end face <b>21</b>B is formed in a flat face shape and a front end face <b>59</b> is attached to be brought into contact with the flat face <b>58</b> of the gun chip <b>16</b>B in the cap-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0081">Numeral <b>61</b> designates a ring-like flow path provided at an inner bottom portion of the gun chip in the cap-like shape, numeral <b>62</b> designates a cylindrical portion of the signal transmitting part, and numeral <b>63</b> designates an outer peripheral face of the cylindrical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line <b>9</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and a second flow path <b>36</b>B is constituted by an inner peripheral face <b>64</b> of the gun chip <b>16</b>B in the cap-like shape, three pieces of support portions <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B projected from the cylindrical portion (notation <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B to an outer side in a diameter direction and, for example, three pieces of grooves portions <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>65</b> formed at the outer peripheral face (notation <b>63</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the cylindrical portion, and a ring-like flow path (notation <b>61</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) formed in a tail direction of the drawing of the support portions <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0083">That is, the second flow path <b>36</b>B is constituted by, for example, three pieces of the groove portions <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>65</b> notched to be formed at an outer peripheral face <b>66</b> of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B by constituting outer peripheral faces of the support portions <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>B as the outer peripheral face <b>66</b> of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0084">Further, although a number of the groove portions <b>65</b> is constituted by three pieces in the above-described, the number is arbitrary and the number is not limited to three pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">A cooing agent always flows in the groove portions <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>65</b>, and therefore, the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B can sufficiently be cooled. Therefore, thermal deformation of the signal transmitting part <b>19</b>B can be prevented in a spot welding operation.</p>
