<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus are disclosed that permit multi-directional fiber optic connections to a device. The multi-directional aspect of the fiber optic connections permit the connections to be aligned closely with the direction of travel of the fiber optic cables that interface with the device. Closely aligning the fiber optic connections on the device with the fiber optic cables' direction of travel maximizes the bend radius of the fiber optic cable near the point of connection or eliminates the bend altogether and reduces the likelihood of a broken fiber or signal attenuation.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to fiber optics used for signal transfer. More particularly, the present invention is based on multi-directional fiber optic connections for devices with fiber optic inputs and/or outputs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fiber optic cables are useful for signal transfer. Light pulses representing data travel through the cables over very long distances and with great immunity to noise and other interference. However, fiber optic cables are more fragile than cables having electrical conductors. The fibers in the cable can be broken if the cable is bent beyond a certain amount. Once fibers are broken, signal transmission that is dependent upon those fibers terminates. Also, signal transfer in optical fibers is more susceptible to attenuation caused by bends in the fiber than is signal transfer through wires.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, broken fibers and attenuation are not a problem in the median regions of the fiber optic cables. However, fiber at the ends of the cables can be troublesome because the cable must often bend where the connector attaches to a device. This is especially true when in confined spaces, such as when the device is mounted in a wall and the fiber connections to the device are made within the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ordinarily in walls, the fiber optic cable is routed parallel to the plane of the wall and within a gap separating panes of the wall. The fiber connections on the device are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the wall. Therefore, the cable must bend to account for the right angle between the direction of the fiber connector and the direction the cable is routed. If this bend forms a radius less than the minimum bend radius for the cable, a fiber break can result or the signal may become too attenuated for proper communication. For relatively narrowly gapped walls, a fiber break or attenuation is more likely to occur because the cable must form a bend with a relatively smaller radius.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses these and other problems by providing multi-directional fiber connections. The fiber connections on the device are movable in relation to the housing so that the fiber optic cables can interface with the fiber connections on the device while forming a greater bend radius than would result had fixed fiber connections been used. The greater bend radius reduces the likelihood of broken fibers or signal attenuation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is embodied in a device for coupling a first signal line to a fiber optic cable. The device includes a main housing and also includes at least one connector receptacle that is movably supported by the main housing. The connector receptacle is for interfacing with the fiber optic cable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is also embodied in a method for providing a device that couples a first signal line to a fiber optic cable. The method involves providing a main housing having a connector receptacle mount and providing a connector receptacle that is configured to movably attach to the connector receptacle mount and receive the fiber optic cable. The method also involves movably affixing the connector receptacle to the main housing by attaching the connector receptacle to the connector receptacle mount.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another device embodying the present invention includes a main housing. The device also includes means for movably supporting a connector receptacle within the main housing. The connector receptacle interfaces with a fiber optic cable and transfers the signal being carried by the fiber optic cable.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views. Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the invention, which is limited only by the scope of the claims attached hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides multi-directional connections for fiber optic cable to devices with fiber optic inputs and/or outputs referred to as connector receptacles. The multi-directional connections can take various forms including pivotal connections, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>, that limit the connection's movement to rotation about one axis. Other multi-directional connections are possible as well such as orbital type connections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> allowing movement of the connections in a virtually unlimited number of axes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Devices utilizing the present invention allow the connections to be oriented in a direction that more closely aligns the connector receptacle with the direction of travel of the fiber optic cable. This alignment allows the fiber optic cable to interface with the device with a relatively large bend radius or no bend at all. Maximizing the bend radius reduces the likelihood that fiber breaks will occur or that the light pulse signal will be too greatly attenuated for proper signal transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are front and rear perspective views and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are top and front views of one embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>100</b> in this embodiment is a media converter that receives a signal in one media and outputs the signal in another media. As shown, the media converter <b>100</b> is setup to establish two-way communication using two fiber optic cables, one for transmitting and one for receiving, and a single RJ-45 jack supporting bi-directional communication. The media converter <b>100</b> receives light signals through one fiber optic receptacle <b>106</b> that interfaces with a fiber optic cable (not shown) that carries the received light signal. The media converter <b>100</b> outputs an electrical signal corresponding to the light signal through an RJ-45 jack <b>116</b> which has a plurality of electrically conductive pins <b>116</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment shown, the media converter also receives electrical signals through the RJ-45 jack <b>116</b> and converts the electrical signal to light signals that are output through connector receptacle <b>108</b>. Another fiber optic cable (not shown) interfaces with connector receptacle <b>108</b> and carries the light signal being transmitted by the media converter <b>100</b>. Other devices in addition to media converters may utilize the present invention, and the number and types of connector receptacles and jacks employed by the device may vary from those shown.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The device <b>100</b> in this embodiment has a main housing <b>101</b> consisting of two joined hulls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The hulls <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are held together by assembly connections <b>120</b> formed by tabs and nubs. The hulls <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> provide mounting catches <b>114</b> that hold the device in place when mounted in a wall frame. The hulls <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> form a semi-cylindrical end <b>118</b> where the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are located. The connector receptacles <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of this embodiment are unified by a second housing <b>110</b> that is cylindrical. The second housing <b>110</b> fits within the semi-cylindrical end of the main housing <b>101</b> formed by hulls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second housing <b>110</b> provides end shafts <b>112</b> that protrude through holes <b>113</b> in the semi-cylindrical end of the device <b>100</b>. The end shafts <b>112</b> secure the second housing <b>110</b> within the main housing <b>101</b> but allow the second housing <b>110</b> to rotate about the axis formed by the end shafts <b>112</b>. The second housing <b>110</b> supports the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The semi-cylindrical end <b>118</b> of the main housing <b>101</b> is provided with slots <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> from which the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> protrude. Because the second housing <b>110</b> is able to rotate and the slots are provided in the main housing, the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are able to pivot about the axis formed by the endshafts <b>112</b>. Some friction results from the endshafts <b>112</b> located within the holes <b>113</b>, and this friction holds the receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> in a given position when they are not otherwise being pivoted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An exploded view of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The top hull <b>102</b> of the device <b>100</b> has mounting tabs <b>114</b> that allow the device to be inserted into a wall mount and fixed in place. The top hull <b>102</b> also has housing assembly tabs <b>134</b> for securing the top hull <b>102</b> to the bottom hull <b>104</b>. The top hull <b>102</b> also is provided with a quarter cylindrical end <b>119</b> with a semi-circular hole <b>113</b>&#x2032; that supports the endshafts <b>112</b> of the second housing <b>110</b> along with a semi-circular hole <b>113</b>&#x2033; in the bottom hull <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bottom hull <b>104</b> similarly has mounting tabs <b>114</b> for mounting the device to a wall mount. The bottom hull <b>104</b> also provides nubs <b>136</b> that provide a catch for the assembly tabs <b>134</b> located on the top hull <b>102</b>. The top hull <b>102</b> and bottom hull <b>104</b> are secured together by the assembly tabs <b>134</b> and nubs <b>136</b>. The media converter components of the exemplary embodiment are housed within the main housing <b>101</b> created by the attachment of the top hull <b>102</b> and the bottom hull <b>104</b>. The bottom hull <b>104</b> also provides a quarter cylindrical end <b>117</b> that forms a semi-cylindrical end <b>118</b> when mated with the quarter cylindrical end <b>119</b> of the top hull <b>102</b>. Slots <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> are also provided in the bottom hull <b>104</b> and are aligned with slots <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the top hull <b>102</b> to permit connector receptacle movement relative to the main housing <b>101</b> formed by the joined top and bottom hulls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The media converter components within the main housing <b>101</b> include a circuit board <b>132</b> supporting jack <b>116</b>. A circuit board <b>130</b> is also included and supports transformers <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and an integrated circuit chip <b>128</b>. These components are discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a perspective view of an embodiment utilizing a transformer configuration different than that of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The top hull <b>102</b> has been removed so that the fit of the components within the bottom hull <b>104</b> can be seen. In this embodiment, the transformers <b>124</b>&#x2032; and <b>126</b>&#x2032; are mounted side-by-side with their longitudinal direction extending side-to-side rather than front-to-back. The transformers <b>124</b>&#x2032; and <b>126</b>&#x2032; are mounted to a circuit board <b>130</b>&#x2032; having a space <b>128</b>&#x2032; for mounting the integrated circuit chip <b>128</b>. The circuit board <b>130</b>&#x2032; mounts to a circuit board <b>133</b> supporting the jack <b>116</b>. The circuit board <b>133</b> is supported by the bottom hull <b>104</b> that also supports the second housing <b>110</b> with receptacles <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The media converter components, partially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, are well known in the art and include the RJ-45 jack <b>116</b> mounted to a circuit board <b>132</b>. Also included in the standard media converter components are the integrated circuit <b>128</b> and transformers <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. As shown, the integrated circuit <b>128</b> and transformers <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> are mounted on circuit board <b>130</b> that is connected to circuit board <b>132</b> by header connector <b>131</b>. The circuit board <b>132</b> permits transfer of electrical signals from the RJ-45 jack <b>116</b> to circuit board <b>130</b> and from circuit board <b>130</b> to a flex circuit <b>142</b> that electrically communicates with receptacle circuit board <b>123</b>. Receptacle circuit board <b>123</b> supports converter circuitry (not shown) that communicates with the integrated circuit <b>128</b> through the flex circuit <b>142</b>. The converter circuitry (not shown) and receptacle board <b>123</b> are mounted within the second housing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The converter circuitry (not shown) supported by the receptacle circuit board <b>123</b> and housed by the second housing <b>110</b> has a photodetector fixed relative to the connector receptacle <b>106</b> for receiving light that has transferred from the fiber optic cable that is connected to the connector receptacle <b>106</b>. The photodetector converts the light pulses into electrical signals that are passed to the integrated circuit <b>128</b> through the flex circuit <b>142</b>. The integrated circuit <b>128</b> takes the electrical data signals from the photodetector and conditions the signal, as is well known in the art, for transmission through electrical wires that contact the pins <b>116</b>&#x2032; of the RJ-45 jack <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The converter circuitry supported by the receptacle circuit board <b>123</b> and housed by the second housing <b>110</b> also has a light emitter fixed relative to the connector receptacle <b>108</b>. The emitter is for applying light pulses to the fiber optic cable interfaced with the connector receptacle <b>108</b>. The emitter converts electrical signals that were passed through the RJ-45 jack <b>116</b> and conditioned by the integrated circuit <b>128</b> into the light pulse signals that can be transmitted by the fiber optic cable. The emitter receives the electrical signal through the flex circuit <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As is known in the art, the flex circuit <b>142</b> is a flexible piece of material that has individual, isolated conductors passing through it. The flex circuit <b>142</b> allows the emitter and the photodetector to remain in electrical communication with the circuit board <b>130</b> even though the emitter and photodetector move in relation to the circuit board <b>130</b> when the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> move in relation to the main housing <b>101</b>. In this embodiment, the flex circuit <b>142</b> allows the bend in the signal transfer media to occur in wires of the flex circuit <b>142</b> rather than in the fiber. Wires generally are not damaged by a relatively small bend radius, and electrical signal attenuation does not occur in wire bends. Therefore, signal transfer is unaffected by the movement of the connector receptacles <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> in relation to the main housing <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the embodiment shown illustrates a main housing <b>101</b> supporting the connector receptacles <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> such that they may pivot, the connector receptacles <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be movably supported in other ways. For example, the connector receptacles may be orbitally supported by the main housing <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> and discussed below. Furthermore, the connector receptacles may vary in number for a given device and may be independently movable with respect to one another. For instance, each connector receptacle may have its own independent orbital support.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also, the connector receptacles may movably attach to the main housing directly, rather than through the secondary housing. The main housing may provide connector receptacle mounts other than a second housing. For example, the connector receptacles could mount to the main housing with pins that rotate within mounting holes provided by the main housing. Other methods for mounting the connector receptacles to the main housing without using secondary housings are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The range of movement of the connector receptacles can be restricted if necessary. Limiting the size of the slot that the connector receptacle protrudes from is one way to provide such a restriction. An example of where a limited range of movement is desirable is where the opening in the secondary housing that allows the flex circuit to pass through can be partially exposed to the outside by the slot for the connector receptacle's protrusion. If a restriction is not imposed and the connector receptacle is moved to an extreme position, such exposure may occur. Therefore, it may be desirable to prevent the opening for the flex circuit to be exposed to prevent debris from entering the second housing and/or the main housing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a side view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a perspective view of two media converter units <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> being positioned in a wall mount configuration. The units <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> are horizontally mounted and the ends opposite the fiber optic cable connectors <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> typically mount flush with the wall's surface. Often the wall is double paned with a gap between each pane. The units <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> mount within the gap to remain out of view.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fiber optic cables generally pass between the panes and approach the units <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> from above or below. The connector receptacles <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> can be angled toward the approach direction of the fiber optic cables <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. The fiber optic cables <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> can be aligned with and inserted into the connector receptacles <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> with a minimum amount of bending. Because the connector receptacles <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> are directed toward the cable's direction of travel, the bend radius of the fiber optic cable near the cable connectors <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> is maximized or eliminated altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> show an alternative embodiment of the present invention employing orbital connections to the main housing <b>300</b> for each connector receptacle <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>. The orbital or ball-and-socket type connections allow the connector receptacles to move in many directions relative to the main housing, and to move independently of one another. Thus, the fiber cable providing a signal to the device may approach from one direction and the fiber cable transmitting a signal from the device may approach from another direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The housing <b>300</b> includes a top hull <b>302</b> and a bottom hull <b>304</b> attached to one another with assembly connections <b>320</b>. The housing <b>300</b> includes mounting tabs <b>314</b> for fixing the device in place within a wall mount. The bottom hull <b>304</b> supports a circuit board <b>332</b>. The circuit board <b>332</b> supports a jack <b>316</b> and a header connector <b>331</b>. A circuit board <b>330</b> is mounted to the header connector <b>331</b> and supports transformers <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> and an integrated circuit chip (not shown) that may be mounted in chip area <b>328</b>. The circuit board <b>332</b> provides electrical connections between the jack <b>316</b> and the chip. The circuit board <b>332</b> also provides electrical connections between the chip and two flex circuits (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One flex circuit carries electrical signals between the circuit board <b>332</b> and a photoelectric circuit board <b>323</b>. The photoelectric circuit board <b>323</b> is connected to the connector receptacle <b>308</b>. The other flex circuit carries electrical signals between the circuit board <b>332</b> and a photoelectric circuit board <b>325</b>. The photoelectric circuit board <b>325</b> is connected to the connector receptacle <b>306</b>. The photoelectric circuit board <b>323</b> is mounted within an orb <b>309</b> including a top orb hull <b>310</b> and a bottom orb hull <b>310</b>&#x2032;. Likewise, the photoelectric circuit board <b>325</b> is mounted within an orb <b>312</b> including a top orb hull <b>311</b> and a bottom orb hull <b>311</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The orb <b>309</b> is supported by the main housing <b>300</b>, but the connector receptacle <b>308</b> remains movable in many directions due to the semi-circular recess <b>324</b> in the top hull <b>302</b> and the semi-circular recess <b>340</b> in the bottom hull <b>304</b> that form a circular hole of the main housing <b>300</b> that is slightly smaller in diameter than the orb <b>309</b>. Likewise, the orb <b>312</b> is supported by the main housing <b>300</b>, but the connector receptacle <b>306</b> remains movable in many directions due to the semi-circular recess <b>322</b> in the top hull <b>302</b> and the semi-circular recess <b>338</b> in the bottom hull <b>304</b>. The circular holes of the main housing <b>300</b> are formed on a semi-cylindrical end <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The two orbs <b>309</b> and <b>312</b> are independently movable with respect to the housing <b>300</b>. Thus, an input fiber cable (not shown) may approach the main housing <b>300</b> from one direction while the output fiber cable (not shown) may approach the main housing <b>300</b> from another direction, and each orb <b>309</b>, <b>312</b> can be moved to point toward the direction from which the corresponding fiber cable approaches. For example, the input fiber cable may approach from above the housing <b>300</b> while the output cable approaches from below the housing <b>300</b>. Orb <b>309</b> can be directed upward while orb <b>312</b> is directed downward. Similarly, the input cable may approach from the left while the output cable approaches from the right. Orb <b>309</b> can be directed to the left while orb <b>312</b> is directed to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other changes in the form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
