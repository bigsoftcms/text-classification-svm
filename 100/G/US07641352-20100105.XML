<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a backlight usable in a display device, and more particularly, to a light emitting diode (LED) backlight unit with deviated LED pitch usable in a display device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are commonly used as display devices for compact electronic apparatuses because of their capability of displaying images with good quality while using little power. However, the liquid crystals in an LCD do not emit any light themselves. The liquid crystals have to be lit up by a light source so as to clearly and sharply display text and images. Usually, a backlight device is employed as such a light source.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, a backlight device comprises a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are arranged in the form of a matrix. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a conventional LED backlight device <b>700</b>, where a plurality of LEDs <b>710</b> are arranged along a row direction <b>770</b> and a column direction <b>772</b> such that any two adjacent rows have an identical pitch, P<sub>row</sub>, therebetween and any two adjacent columns have an identical pitch, P<sub>col</sub>, therebetween. Such an arrangement of the backlight device needs more LEDs, thereby increasing the cost of the backlight device. Simply reducing the number of LEDs, however, is not a solution because it may affect the uniformity of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention, in one aspect, relates to a backlight unit usable in a liquid crystal display. In one embodiment, the backlight unit comprises a substrate. The substrate is formed with a first edge, a second edge, a third edge and a fourth edge, and wherein the first edge is opposite to the second edge, the third edge is opposite to the fourth edge, and the first edge is connected to the third edge.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The backlight unit further comprises a first plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a plurality of rows such that two neighboring rows define a first pitch therebetween, and a second plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a row such that the row of the second plurality of light emitting elements is separated from the closest neighboring row of the first plurality of light emitting elements by a second pitch. The second pitch is greater than the first pitch. Additionally, the row of the second plurality of light emitting elements is positioned between its closest neighboring row of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the first edge of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the backlight unit comprises a third plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a row, where the row of the third plurality of light emitting elements is positioned between its closest neighboring row of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the second edge of the substrate. The row of the third plurality of light emitting elements is separated from the closest neighboring row of the first plurality of light emitting elements by a third pitch. The third pitch is greater than the first pitch. The row of the second plurality of light emitting elements and the first edge of the substrate define a first distance therebetween, and the row of the third plurality of light emitting elements and the second edge of the substrate define a second distance therebetween. In one embodiment, the first distance is less than the second pitch, and the second distance is less than the third pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the backlight unit comprises a fourth plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a first column and a second column, where the first column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements is positioned between its closest neighboring column of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the third edge of the substrate, and the second column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements is positioned between its closest neighboring column of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the fourth edge of the substrate. In one embodiment, the first column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements is separated from the closest neighboring column of the first plurality of light emitting elements by a fourth pitch, and the second column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements is separated from the closest neighboring column of the first plurality of light emitting elements by a fifth pitch. Each of the fourth pitch and the fifth pitch is greater than the first pitch, but less than three times of the first pitch. In one embodiment, the first column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements and the third edge of the substrate define a third distance therebetween, and the second column of the fourth plurality of light emitting elements and the fourth edge of the substrate define a fourth distance therebetween. The third distance is less than the fourth pitch, and the fourth distance is less than the fifth pitch, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, each of the first plurality of light emitting elements, the second plurality of light emitting elements, the third plurality of light emitting elements and the fourth plurality of light emitting elements comprises at least three LED chips. The at least three LED chips comprise at least a first LED chip capable of emitting light in a red color, a second LED chip capable of emitting light in a blue color, and a third LED chip capable of emitting light in a green color. In another embodiment, each of the first plurality of light emitting elements, the second plurality of light emitting elements, the third plurality of light emitting elements, and the fourth plurality of light emitting elements comprises a LED chip capable of emitting light in a white color.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the present invention relates to a backlight unit for use in a liquid crystal display. In one embodiment, the backlight unit includes a substrate having a first zone and a second zone; a first plurality of light emitting elements positioned in the first zone of the substrate and arranged in a plurality of rows, where two neighboring rows define a first pitch therebetween; and a second plurality of light emitting elements positioned in the second zone of the substrate, where the first zone and the second zone are at least partially separated by a second pitch. The second pitch is greater than the first pitch. The second plurality of light emitting elements are arranged in at least one row, substantially parallel to an edge of the substrate and separated by a distance therebetween, and wherein the distance is less than the second pitch. In one embodiment, the distance is less than 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, each of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the second plurality of light emitting elements comprises at least three LED chips, where the at least three LED chips comprise at least a first LED chip capable of emitting light in a red color, a second LED chip capable of emitting light in a blue color, and a third LED chip capable of emitting light in a green color. In another embodiment, each of the first plurality of light emitting elements and the second plurality of light emitting elements comprises a LED chip capable of emitting light in a white color.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a light emitting diode (LED) package structure for use in a liquid crystal display. In one embodiment, the LED package structure comprises a substrate; a first plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a plurality of columns such that two neighboring columns define a first pitch therebetween; a second plurality of light emitting elements positioned on the substrate and arranged in a column such that the column of the second plurality of light emitting elements is separated from the closest neighboring column of the first plurality of light emitting elements by a second pitch, where the first pitch is less than the second pitch; a sidewall formed on the edges of the substrate; and an optical film supported by the sidewall and positioned to face the first plurality of light emitting elements and the second plurality of light emitting elements.</p>
