<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to operations performed and equipment utilized in conjunction with subterranean wells and, in an embodiment described herein, more particularly provides a fiber optic splice housing and integral dry mate connector system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical connections between sections of optical fiber can be used in well completions, such as gravel pack completions. Unfortunately, each optical connection will result in some optical transmission loss. For this reason, the use optical connections should be minimized, or avoided, if possible.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While running a completion string into a well, with an optical fiber in a conduit strapped to the completion string, a mishap may cause the conduit and/or the optical fiber to become damaged. If a considerable length of the conduit has already been run into the well when the damage occurs, then this may be a situation in which it would be preferable to use an optical connection between sections of the optical fiber, with the resultant optical transmission loss, rather than go to the expense of pulling the considerable length of conduit out of the well and replacing it.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Where an optical distributed temperature sensing system includes an optical connection between sections of optical fiber, the optical connection also results in an effective &#x201c;blinding&#x201d; of the system to temperature determinations in a significant length of the optical fiber below the optical connection. Therefore, it would be desirable to be able to store the significant length of the optical fiber below the optical connection in a convenient location downhole, so that the inability of the system to sense temperature in this length of optical fiber would not impair the system's ability to sense temperature along an interval in the well.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typical optical distributed temperature sensing systems use estimations of a characteristic of an optical fiber known as &#x201c;differential attenuation&#x201d; in calculating temperature along the optical fiber based on optical signals returned by the optical fiber. It would be desirable to be able to directly determine a value for the differential attenuation of an optical fiber downhole, or to calibrate a distributed temperature sensing system by adjusting the value of differential attenuation used by the system in calculating temperature, in order to accurately calibrate the system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide improved optical connections and connection systems which will reduce the optical transmission loss due to such connections, enhance the convenience in making such connections, increase the reliability of such connections, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In carrying out the principles of the present invention, in accordance with one of multiple embodiments described below, improved optical connections and connection systems are provided. Methods are also provided for calibrating distributed temperature sensing systems, and for storing substantial lengths of optical fiber downhole.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the invention, a fiber optic connection system is provided which includes optical fiber sections in respective conduit sections. Each of the conduit sections is received in the housing assembly. An optical connection between the optical fiber sections is positioned within the housing assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the invention, a method of optically connecting optical fiber sections to each other is provided. The method includes the steps of: positioning each of the optical fiber sections within a respective conduit section; optically connecting the optical fiber sections to each other using an optical connection; and containing the connection within a housing assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the invention, a fiber optic connection apparatus is provided which includes optical fiber sections in respective conduit sections. Each of the conduit sections is received in a respective one of opposite ends of a housing assembly, so that the housing assembly is reciprocably displaceable over the conduit sections. An optical connection is formed between the optical fiber sections.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A fiber optic connection is provided by the present invention. The fiber optic connection includes a fiber optic connector having an optical fiber section therein. A conduit is attached to the fiber optic connector, with the optical fiber section extending through the conduit. In another aspect of the invention, the fiber optic connector is sealed so that fluid flow through the fiber optic connector is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An optical fiber storage apparatus is also provided by the present invention. The apparatus includes a generally tubular body having at least one circumferentially extending recess formed thereon. At least one optical fiber section is received in the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect of the invention, a method of calibrating an optical distributed temperature sensing system for differential attenuation includes the steps of: positioning an optical fiber in a wellbore; and storing a substantial length of the optical fiber in a storage apparatus in the well, so that the substantial length of the optical fiber is at a same temperature in the well.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a still further aspect of the invention, an optical distributed temperature sensing system is provided. The system includes an optical fiber extending along an interval, so that portions of the optical fiber are exposed to different temperatures in the interval. A storage apparatus has a substantial length of the optical fiber stored therein, so that the substantial length of the optical fiber is at a same temperature in the storage apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the invention, the optical distributed temperature sensing system may include a temperature sensing element positioned so that the temperature sensing element is at the same temperature as the substantial length of the first optical fiber. The temperature sensing element may be internal or external to the storage apparatus, independent of the optical fiber, and may be an optical, electrical or mechanical device. The temperature sensing element may be formed on another optical fiber of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other features, advantages, benefits and objects of the present invention will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon careful consideration of the detailed description of representative embodiments of the invention hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an application <b>10</b> for a fiber optic connection system <b>12</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which embodies principles of the present invention. In the following description of the system <b>12</b> and other apparatus and methods described herein, directional terms, such as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, etc., are used for convenience in referring to the accompanying drawings. Additionally, it is to be understood that the various embodiments of the present invention described herein may be utilized in various orientations, such as inclined, inverted, horizontal, vertical, etc., and in various configurations, without departing from the principles of the present invention. The embodiments are described merely as examples of useful applications of the principles of the invention, which are not limited to any specific details of these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a tubular string <b>14</b>, such as a production tubing string, is being lowered into a wellbore <b>16</b>. The tubular string <b>14</b> has a conduit <b>18</b> externally attached thereto, such as by strapping the conduit to the tubular string as it is lowered into the wellbore <b>16</b>. It should be understood, however, that the principles of the invention are not limited to use with a production tubing string or with conduit strapped externally to a tubing string. The tubular string <b>14</b> could instead be a casing, liner, coiled tubing or other type of tubular string, the conduit <b>18</b> could be internal to, or in a sidewall of, the tubular string, use of a tubular string or conduit is not required, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the application <b>10</b>, the conduit <b>18</b> is a tubular string, such as a type known to those skilled in the art as &#x201c;control line,&#x201d; which typically has a diameter of approximately &#xbc; inch. At least one, and preferably multiple, optical fiber(s) extend through the conduit <b>18</b> for uses such as communication, control, sensing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Due to a mishap during the lowering of the tubular string <b>14</b> into the wellbore <b>16</b>, the conduit <b>18</b> has become damaged, such as by severing the conduit into two separate sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Instead of completely severing the conduit <b>18</b>, it could be merely crushed or pierced, so that its pressure-holding or -transmitting capability is questionable. The optical fiber(s) within the conduit <b>18</b> could also be damaged at the time the conduit <b>18</b> is damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If a considerable length of the tubular string <b>14</b> and conduit <b>18</b> has already been lowered into the wellbore <b>16</b> at the time the conduit is damaged, it may be very expensive to pull the tubular string and conduit out of the wellbore, replace the conduit, and run the tubular string and conduit back into the wellbore. Using the principles of the present invention, the decision can be made to instead repair the damaged conduit <b>18</b> and/or optical fibers therein by means of the connection system <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the two conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> have been removed, at least partially, from the tubular string <b>14</b>. Preferably, ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are taken to a work area a safe distance from the rig floor in a non-hazardous environment. The ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are secured to a work surface <b>24</b> (such as a shop table), using clamps, vises or other gripping devices <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If an optical fiber <b>30</b> within the conduit <b>18</b> has been damaged, it will be spliced using a fusion splicer <b>32</b>. To allow access to the optical fiber <b>30</b> by the fusion splicer <b>32</b>, approximately 12 inches of space may be needed between the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. The fusion splicer <b>32</b> is preferably mounted using a device <b>34</b>, such as a telescoping or otherwise translating base, which enables the fusion splicer to be smoothly and accurately moved between a position about the optical fiber <b>30</b> and intermediate the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and a position distanced from the conduit sections as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Prior to using the fusion splicer <b>32</b> to form a fusion splice connection <b>36</b> in the optical fiber <b>30</b>, a housing assembly <b>38</b> is slid over the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. The housing assembly <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a generally tubular housing <b>40</b> and two gripping and sealing devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. Many other configurations of housing assemblies may be used in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing assembly <b>38</b> is used in the connection system <b>12</b> to secure the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to each other, protect the optical fiber <b>30</b> and fusion splice <b>36</b> therein, and to isolate the optical fiber and interior of the conduit <b>18</b> from well pressure and well fluids. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>40</b> and one of the devices <b>44</b> has been installed over the conduit section <b>22</b> and displaced to a position near the gripping device <b>28</b>. The other device <b>42</b> has been installed over the conduit section <b>20</b> and displaced to a position near the gripping device <b>26</b>. In these positions, the housing assembly <b>38</b> is out of the way of use of the fusion splicer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fusion splicer <b>32</b> can now be displaced by the device <b>34</b> to a position in which the optical fiber <b>30</b> is received in the fusion splicer, so that the splice <b>36</b> can be formed. Note that it is not necessary for the fusion splice <b>36</b> to be used, since other types of fiber optic connections can be used in keeping with the principles of the invention. For example, a dry mate type of connection, such as the connection depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> and described below, may be used in place of the fusion splice <b>36</b>. However, the fusion splice <b>36</b> is presently preferred, due to its relatively low optical transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the fusion splice <b>36</b> is formed in the optical fiber <b>30</b>, the fusion splicer <b>32</b> is displaced back out of the way to allow the housing assembly <b>38</b> to be displaced over the splice. At this point, it may be desirable to remove any slack in the optical fiber <b>30</b>, so that tight radius bends in the optical fiber are avoided. To accomplish this, the gripping device <b>26</b> may be displaced away from the other gripping device <b>28</b> to thereby increase the distance between the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. For example, a laterally translating base <b>46</b> may be used to displace the gripping device <b>26</b> away from the other gripping device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the slack in the optical fiber <b>30</b> has been removed, the housing <b>40</b> is displaced to a position in which the splice <b>36</b> is within the housing, and the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are received in respective opposite ends of the housing. An enlarged cross-sectional view showing this position is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this view, multiple optical fibers <b>30</b>, <b>48</b> are shown extending through the conduit <b>18</b>, with the splice <b>36</b> operatively connecting sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of the optical fiber <b>30</b>, and another fusion splice <b>58</b> operatively connecting sections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> of the optical fiber <b>48</b>. Thus, it will be appreciated that multiple optical fibers can be used in a conduit in the connection system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After positioning the housing <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are used to grip the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and seal off the interior of the housing. The devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be conventional tube fittings, for example, of the type sold by Swagelock Company of Solon, Ohio. Alternatively, the devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be special proprietary fittings, such as FMJ fittings available from WellDynamics, Inc. of Spring, Tex., which fittings utilize multiple metal-to-metal seals to ensure long term reliability in downhole environments.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the housing <b>40</b> has an internal dimension ID (such as an internal diameter) between its opposite ends <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> which is greater than an internal dimension id (such as an internal diameter) at one or both of the ends. In this manner, the interior of the housing <b>40</b> can accommodate deformed ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> (such as may result from damage to the conduit <b>18</b>) without requiring time-consuming straightening of the ends of the conduit sections received in the housing. The opposite ends <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of the housing <b>40</b> may be reduced in size to form the internal dimensions id by, for example, swaging the ends, cold working, hot forging, or any mechanical deforming process, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The reduced internal dimensions id are preferred for use with the WellDynamics FMJ fittings discussed above. However, it should be understood that the reduced internal dimensions id are not necessary in keeping with the principles of the invention. Furthermore, it is not necessary for both of the opposite ends <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> to have the reduced internal dimensions id. For example, only one of the ends <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> could have the reduced internal dimension id, while the other end could have an internal dimension equal to, or greater than, the internal dimension ID.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The housing assembly <b>38</b>, conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and fusion splice connection <b>108</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprise a fiber optic connection apparatus <b>69</b> which may also be used in fiber optic connection systems other than the system <b>12</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another fiber optic connection <b>70</b> which may be used in the system <b>12</b> is representatively illustrated. The connection <b>70</b> could also be used in other systems and/or in other applications, without departing from the principles of the invention. Since some of the elements of the connection <b>70</b> are similar to those described above, the same reference numbers are used to indicate these elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Instead of using a fusion splice to join sections of optical fiber, the connection <b>70</b> is of the type known to those skilled is the art as a &#x201c;dry mate&#x201d; connection. Ends of the optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are precisely aligned, so that light may be transmitted therebetween. For this purpose, the connection <b>70</b> includes two fiber optic connectors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> which, when operatively connected to each other, align the respective optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The connector <b>72</b> has the optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> extending therein from within the conduit <b>20</b> to ferrules <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> positioned in a body <b>80</b> of the connector. The optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> may be attached to the ferrules <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> by, for example, bonding each optical fiber section within the respective ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The ferrule <b>76</b> is recessed inwardly from an end <b>82</b> of the body <b>80</b> of the connector <b>72</b>. The ferrule <b>76</b> is received in an alignment sleeve <b>84</b>, which is also recessed in the end <b>82</b> of the body <b>80</b>. However, the ferrule <b>76</b> is recessed further than the alignment sleeve <b>84</b>, so that the alignment sleeve can also receive therein another ferrule <b>86</b> of the other connector <b>74</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ferrule <b>78</b> extends outwardly from the body <b>80</b> at a recessed shoulder <b>88</b> formed on the body. The shoulder <b>88</b> is recessed inward relative to the end <b>82</b> of the body <b>80</b>. In this manner, the ferrule <b>78</b> can be received in another alignment sleeve go recessed in an end <b>92</b> of a body <b>94</b> of the other connector <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another ferrule <b>96</b> in the body <b>94</b> of the connector <b>74</b> is received in the alignment sleeve go. The ferrule <b>96</b> is recessed further into the end <b>92</b> of the body <b>94</b> than the alignment sleeve go to allow insertion of the ferrule <b>78</b> into the alignment sleeve. The optical fiber section <b>56</b> is attached to the ferrule <b>96</b>, for example, by being bonded therein. When the ferrules <b>78</b>, <b>96</b> are both received in the alignment sleeve go, they are precisely aligned with each other, so that the optical fiber sections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are also precisely aligned end-to-end, thereby permitting optical transmission therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The ferrule <b>86</b> extends outwardly from the body <b>94</b> at a recessed shoulder <b>98</b> formed on the body. The shoulder <b>98</b> is recessed relative to the end <b>92</b> of the body <b>94</b>. The optical fiber section <b>52</b> is attached to the ferrule <b>86</b>, for example, by bonding the optical fiber section within the ferrule. When the connectors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are operatively connected, the ferrule <b>86</b> is received in the alignment sleeve <b>84</b>, which precisely aligns the ferrules <b>76</b>, <b>86</b>, thereby precisely aligning the optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> end-to-end and permitting optical transmission therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, the ferrule <b>86</b> does not extend outward from the body <b>94</b> beyond the end <b>92</b>, and the ferrule <b>78</b> does not extend outward from the body <b>80</b> beyond the end <b>82</b>, so that the ferrules are protected by the ends of the connectors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> prior to connecting the connectors to each other. More preferably, the ferrules <b>78</b>, <b>86</b> are recessed relative to the respective ends <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> for enhanced protection of the ferrules.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A biasing device <b>100</b>, such as a coiled compression spring, may be used to bias the ferrule <b>76</b> into very close proximity, or actual contact, with the ferrule <b>86</b> when the connectors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are connected. Similarly, another biasing device <b>102</b> may be used to bias the ferrule <b>96</b> into very close proximity, or actual contact, with the ferrule <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A seal <b>104</b> may be used to prevent fluid flow through the body <b>80</b> of the connector <b>72</b>. The seal <b>104</b> preferably prevents any well fluid or pressure which might enter the connector <b>72</b> from passing into the conduit section <b>20</b>. The seal <b>104</b> could be entirely disposed within the body <b>80</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or it could be partially or entirely disposed within the end of the conduit section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The seal <b>104</b> could be a hardenable fluid which is flowed about the optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> in the body <b>80</b>, and is then allowed to harden. A material such as epoxy could be used for this purpose. Other materials, such as elastomers, non-elastomers, etc., could be used in addition, or as an alternative. A similar seal <b>106</b> may be used in the body <b>94</b> of the connector <b>74</b> and/or in the end of the conduit section <b>22</b> to prevent fluid flow through the body <b>94</b>, and to prevent passage of well fluid and pressure into the conduit section.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The body <b>80</b> may be attached to the end of the conduit section <b>20</b> using any of a variety of methods. For example, the body <b>80</b> could be welded to the end of the conduit section <b>20</b>, the body could be threaded into the conduit section, a fastener (such as a pin, dowel, screw, rivet, etc.) could be used to fasten the body to the conduit section, the body could be molded onto or into the end of the conduit section, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Any means of attaching or connecting the body <b>80</b> to the conduit section <b>20</b> may be used in keeping with the principles of the invention. Preferably, this attachment prevents fluid from flowing between the body <b>80</b> and the conduit section <b>20</b>. The body <b>94</b> may be similarly attached to the end of the conduit section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the bodies <b>80</b>, <b>94</b> are molded parts, then the seals <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be formed integrally with the bodies in the molding process. It is not necessary for the seals <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> to be elements separate from the bodies <b>80</b>, <b>94</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the connection <b>70</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as being used to connect two pairs of optical fiber sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, it should be understood that any number of optical fiber sections may be connected in keeping with the principles of the invention. Three pairs of optical fiber sections may be connected using a connection similar to the connection <b>70</b>, without exceeding the outer diameter of a conventional control line tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the connection <b>70</b> is depicted as it may be used in the system <b>12</b>. The connection <b>70</b> is positioned within the housing assembly <b>38</b>. The devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> grip and seal to the respective conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> on either side of the connection <b>70</b>. In this manner, the connection <b>70</b> is isolated from well fluids and pressures by the housing assembly <b>38</b>. If, however, the housing assembly <b>38</b> should become damaged or leak, the seals <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in the connectors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> will prevent the well fluids and pressures from entering the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If the connection <b>70</b> is used in the system <b>12</b> in place of the fusion splice connection <b>108</b> (fusion splices <b>36</b>, <b>58</b>) described above, then of course the fusion splicer <b>32</b> would not be used. The housing <b>40</b> may also be made somewhat shorter, since there is no need to accommodate the fusion splicer <b>32</b> between the ends of the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. It is believed that the fusion splice connection <b>108</b> would be most suitably used for repairs or otherwise unanticipated connections, whereas the dry mate connection <b>70</b> would be most suitably used for pre-planned connections, but either connection could be used in either situation in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing assembly <b>38</b>, conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and dry mate connection <b>70</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> comprise a fiber optic connection apparatus <b>109</b> which may also be used in fiber optic connection systems other than the system <b>12</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another connection system <b>110</b> is representatively illustrated. The system <b>110</b> is similar in some respects to the system <b>12</b> described above, and so elements which are similar to those described above are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> using the same reference numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The system <b>110</b> includes both a fusion splice connection <b>108</b> and a dry mate connection <b>70</b> positioned within a housing assembly <b>112</b>. Unlike the housing assembly <b>38</b> described above, the housing assembly <b>112</b> includes multiple generally tubular housings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. The fusion splice connection <b>108</b> is positioned within the housing <b>114</b>, and the dry mate connection <b>70</b> is positioned within the housing <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The housings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are connected to each other at a pressure-tight connection <b>118</b>, which may include one or more metal-to-metal seals. The connection <b>118</b> could, for example, be configured similar to a WellDynamics FMJ fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The connection system <b>110</b> permits the connector <b>72</b> of the dry mate connection <b>70</b> to be connected to optical fibers in the conduit section <b>20</b> in the field. This may be advantageous where a well tool, such as a packer, valve, etc., is supplied to the field with the dry mate connector <b>74</b> already installed, and optical fibers in the conduit section <b>20</b> are to be connected to optical fibers in the well tool. In that situation, the housing <b>116</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be considered as the well tool having the connector <b>74</b> pre-installed therein. The housing <b>116</b> could alternatively be attached to the conduit <b>22</b> external or internal to a well tool.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To make the optical connection, the housing <b>116</b> would be secured, such as by using the device <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The connector <b>72</b> would be connected to the connector <b>74</b>. The conduit section <b>20</b> would be secured, such as by gripping it with the device <b>26</b>. The housing <b>114</b> and device <b>42</b> would be slid over the conduit section <b>20</b>. The fusion splicer <b>32</b> would then be used to form the splices <b>36</b>, <b>58</b> between the optical fibers in the conduit section <b>20</b> and the optical fibers in the connector <b>72</b>. The translating base <b>46</b> would be used to displace the device <b>26</b> away from the device <b>28</b> to remove slack from the optical fibers. The housing <b>114</b> would be attached and sealed to the housing <b>116</b> at the connection <b>118</b>. The device <b>42</b> would be used to attach and seal the housing <b>114</b> to the conduit section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This is similar to the method described above for forming the fusion splice connection <b>108</b> in the system <b>12</b>. A main difference in the system <b>110</b> is that the housing <b>116</b> and dry mate connection <b>70</b> are interposed to one side of the fusion splice connection <b>108</b>. Note that in the system <b>110</b> it is not necessary for the conduit section <b>22</b> to be used, since the optical fibers therein could instead terminate in the housing <b>116</b>, or could be otherwise positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The housing assembly <b>112</b>, conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, dry mate connection <b>70</b>, and fusion splice connection <b>108</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> comprise a fiber optic connection apparatus <b>119</b> which may also be used in fiber optic connection systems other than the system <b>110</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a fiber storage apparatus <b>120</b> is representatively illustrated. In situations where a connection is made between optical fibers used downhole, it may be desirable to store a substantial length of optical fiber. For example, in a distributed temperature sensing system, the temperature of approximately 1 meter of optical fiber might not be effectively sensed beyond a fusion splice connection, and the temperature of at least approximately 10 meters of optical fiber might not be effectively sensed beyond a dry mate connection.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus, it would be beneficial to be able to store at least one meter, and preferably 10-50 meters or more, of optical fiber beyond an optical connection in a distributed temperature sensing system. In such a system, it would be desirable to store the substantial length of optical fiber after the optical connection in the fiber without causing any sharp radius bends in the fiber, which might lead to premature failure of the fiber. Note that the fiber storage apparatus <b>120</b> could be used in applications other than distributed temperature sensing systems, in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The fiber storage apparatus <b>120</b> includes a generally tubular body <b>122</b> and a generally tubular outer housing <b>124</b>. The body <b>122</b> and housing <b>124</b> are configured for interconnection in a tubular string, such as the tubular string <b>14</b> described above, so that a flow passage <b>126</b> of the tubular string extends through the body and housing. Any type of tubular string could be used with the apparatus <b>120</b> (such as production tubing, casing, liner or coiled tubing strings, etc.), but it is not necessary for the body <b>122</b> and housing <b>124</b> to be interconnected in a tubular string in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The body <b>122</b> has gripping and sealing devices <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> installed at an upper end thereof for attaching conduit sections <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> to the body. The devices <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> could be similar to, or the same as, the devices <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> described above. The conduit sections <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> could be similar to, or the same as, the conduit sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An optical fiber section <b>136</b> extends through the conduit section <b>132</b> and into the body <b>122</b> via a passage <b>140</b>. Another optical fiber section <b>138</b> extends through the conduit section <b>134</b> and into the body <b>122</b> via another passage <b>142</b>. The optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> may be separate sections of an optical fiber which are connected via a fusion splice connection (such as the fusion splices <b>36</b>, <b>58</b> described above) or a dry mate connection (such as the connection <b>70</b> described above), or the optical fiber sections could be connected in another manner. Alternatively, the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> could be the same, i.e., a continuous length of optical fiber, instead of being separate sections of an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are separate connected sections of an optical fiber, then the connection between the optical fiber sections may be contained within the storage apparatus <b>120</b>, as described below. However, it should be understood that it is not necessary for any connection between the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, if any, to be contained within the storage apparatus <b>120</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Each of the passages <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> intersects an annular circumferentially extending recess <b>144</b> formed externally on the body <b>122</b>. Another similarly configured recess <b>146</b> is formed on the body <b>122</b> spaced apart from the recess <b>144</b>. Prior to installing the housing <b>124</b> on the body <b>122</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are wound about the body in the recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> to thereby store a substantial length of optical fiber in the recesses. The housing <b>124</b> is then installed over the recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> and sealed to the body <b>122</b> above and below the recesses, preferably using one or more metal-to-metal seals and/or elastomeric or non-elastomeric seals <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>. Preferably, the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> and the interior of the apparatus <b>120</b> are thus maintained at atmospheric pressure when the apparatus is installed in a well.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a manner in which the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> may be wound about the body <b>122</b> is representatively illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the body <b>122</b> and optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are shown apart from the remainder of the apparatus <b>120</b> for illustrative clarity. The body <b>122</b> is also rotated somewhat about its vertical axis, so that the manner in which the optical fiber section <b>136</b> extends through the passage <b>140</b> and recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> can be clearly viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that the optical fiber section <b>136</b> extends downwardly through the passage <b>140</b> to the recess <b>144</b>. The optical fiber section <b>136</b> then extends in another curved recess <b>152</b> which interconnects the recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. The optical fiber section <b>136</b> extends only briefly in the recess <b>146</b> before extending in another curved recess <b>154</b> which also interconnects the recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. The recess <b>154</b> permits the optical fiber section <b>136</b> to extend back up to the recess <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this manner, the optical fiber section <b>136</b> is directed through the passage <b>140</b> and recesses <b>152</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>154</b> to the recess <b>144</b>. The optical fiber section <b>136</b> is thus received in the upper recess <b>144</b> without making any sharp radius bends which might break, otherwise damage or cause long term reliability problems. The other optical fiber section <b>138</b> is similarly directed through the passage <b>142</b> and another curved recess (similar to the recess <b>152</b>) to the lower recess <b>146</b> without making any sharp radius bends.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With the optical fiber section <b>136</b> received in the upper recess <b>144</b> and the optical fiber section <b>138</b> received in the lower recess <b>146</b>, the optical fiber sections can now be simultaneously wound multiple times about the body, thereby storing multiple wraps of the optical fiber section <b>136</b> in the upper recess <b>144</b>, and multiple wraps of the optical fiber section <b>138</b> in the lower recess <b>146</b>. Thus, this configuration of the body <b>122</b> permits a substantial length of the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> to be stored in the apparatus <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An equal or greater length of either of the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> relative to the other of the optical fiber sections could be stored in the apparatus <b>120</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a greater length of the optical fiber section <b>136</b> is wrapped about the body <b>122</b> as compared to the length of the optical fiber section <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">An optical connection <b>156</b>, such as a fusion splice, between the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> is received in the lower recess <b>146</b>. At the completion of the process of wrapping the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> about the body <b>122</b>, the optical fiber section <b>136</b> is received in another curved recess <b>158</b> interconnecting the upper and lower recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. If the lengths of the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> wrapped about the body <b>122</b> were approximately equal, then the connection <b>156</b> could be received in the recess <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although the apparatus <b>120</b> has been illustrated as including the body <b>122</b> on which the optical fiber sections <b>136</b> are externally wrapped, and the housing <b>124</b> which outwardly contains and protects the optical fiber sections received in the external recesses <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>158</b> formed on the body, it should be clearly understood that many other configurations are possible in keeping with the principles of the invention. For example, the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> could be received internally on the body <b>122</b> (in which case the housing <b>124</b> could inwardly contain and protect the optical fiber sections), or the optical fiber sections could be received in a sidewall of the body (in which case a separate protective housing may not be used), etc. It is also not necessary for the devices <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and passages <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to be positioned at one end of the body <b>122</b>. One of the devices <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and the respective one of the passages <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> could instead be positioned at an opposite end of the body <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, additional optical fibers and/or optical fiber sections could be received or stored in a single storage apparatus <b>120</b>. For example, if the optical fiber sections <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are part of a distributed temperature sensing system, then they may be of the type known to those skilled in the art as multi-mode optical fibers. It may be beneficial to also position an optical fiber of the type known to those skilled in the art as a single mode optical fiber in the apparatus <b>120</b> to provide an independent temperature sensing capability, to provide information for calibrating the distributed temperature sensing system, or for other purposes. Thus, multiple single mode and/or multi-mode optical fibers, and any combination of these, may be received in the storage apparatus <b>120</b> in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a schematic depiction of a method of calibrating an optical distributed temperature sensing system <b>160</b> is representatively illustrated. The temperature sensing system <b>160</b> includes multiple storage apparatuses <b>120</b>. Each of the storage apparatuses <b>120</b> has a substantial length <b>166</b> of a multi-mode optical fiber <b>162</b> stored therein. Also received in each storage apparatus <b>120</b> is a single mode optical fiber <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The optical fiber <b>162</b> may comprise multiple optical fiber sections <b>184</b>, and the optical fiber <b>164</b> may comprise multiple optical fiber sections <b>186</b>. Alternatively, the optical fibers <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> could each be a single length of optical fiber, without being divided into sections.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> are each located below a respective one of multiple optical connections <b>168</b> interconnecting the sections <b>184</b>. As discussed above, an optical distributed temperature sensing system is effectively &#x201c;blinded&#x201d; for a substantial length beyond an optical connection. Thus, by compactly storing the substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> below each connection <b>168</b> in the storage apparatuses <b>120</b>, this blinding of the system <b>160</b> below each connection does not significantly compromise the ability of the system to detect temperature along an interval below the connection.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">However, it should be understood that the apparatuses <b>120</b> can be used whether or not the connections <b>168</b> are formed in the optical fiber <b>162</b>. There are other reasons why it may be beneficial to store the substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the system <b>160</b>, or in systems other than optical distributed temperature sensing systems. For example, the compact storage of a substantial length of the optical fiber <b>162</b> can provide valuable information for calibrating an optical distributed temperature sensing system.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the system <b>160</b>, a parameter known to those skilled in the art as a differential attenuation value used in calculating temperature along the optical fiber <b>162</b> may be accurately adjusted using the substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber stored in the storage apparatuses <b>120</b>, so that the system is more precisely calibrated. Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an idealized graph of temperature (T) versus length (L) along the optical fiber <b>162</b> for the system <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is representatively illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this idealized graph <b>170</b>, for clarity it is assumed that the connections <b>168</b> are not present in the optical fiber <b>162</b>, and the upper storage apparatus <b>120</b> is located at the surface at the beginning of the optical fiber. Surface temperature is at T=0. A horizontal line <b>172</b> extends from the origin (L=0, T=0) on the graph <b>170</b>, indicating that the temperature of the entire substantial length <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the storage apparatus <b>120</b> at the surface is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A positively sloped line <b>174</b> indicates that the temperature of the optical fiber <b>162</b> increases gradually between the storage apparatus <b>120</b> at the surface and the next deeper storage apparatus. Another horizontal line <b>176</b> indicates that the temperature of the entire substantial length <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the storage apparatus <b>120</b> below the surface storage apparatus is at a same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another positively sloped line <b>178</b> on the graph <b>170</b> again indicates that the temperature of the optical fiber <b>162</b> increases gradually between the two storage apparatuses <b>120</b> below the surface storage apparatus. Yet another horizontal line <b>180</b> indicates that the entire substantial length of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the deepest storage apparatus <b>120</b> is at a same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If one of the horizontal lines <b>172</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> is not horizontal in actual practice, then this is an indication that the differential attenuation value used to calculate temperature along the length of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the system <b>160</b> is in error and should be adjusted. When the differential attenuation value used in the system <b>160</b> is properly adjusted, the lines <b>172</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> should be horizontal, since the entire substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b> in the storage apparatuses <b>120</b> should be at respective same temperatures in the well.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the past, the differential attenuation value used in an optical differential temperature sensing system was based on experience, empirical testing of an optical fiber, etc. In contrast, the system <b>160</b> allows the differential attenuation value to be directly evaluated for accuracy in each particular installation. Furthermore, since the differential attenuation value can be evaluated for accuracy at multiple locations in a well (i.e., by using multiple storage apparatuses <b>120</b>), adjustments in the differential attenuation value may be made for different portions of the optical fiber <b>162</b>. For example, in the system <b>160</b>, a first differential attenuation value may be used for the optical fiber <b>162</b> near the storage apparatus <b>120</b> at the surface, a second differential attenuation value may be used for the optical fiber to either side of the next deeper storage apparatus, and a third differential attenuation value may be used for the optical fiber to either side of the deepest storage apparatus. By using separately adjusted differential attenuation values in the system <b>160</b> for respective separate lengths of the optical fiber <b>162</b>, each of the lines <b>172</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> on the graph <b>170</b> can be independently made horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The single mode optical fiber <b>164</b> can have independent temperature sensing elements <b>182</b> located in each of the storage apparatuses <b>120</b>. One or more temperature sensing elements <b>182</b> could be located in each storage apparatus <b>120</b>. By positioning the elements <b>182</b> in the apparatuses <b>120</b>, they will preferably be at the same temperature as the respective substantial lengths <b>166</b> of the optical fiber <b>162</b>. The elements <b>182</b> are schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as being fiber Bragg gratings, but any other type of temperature sensing elements may be used, such as interferometric temperature sensors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The independent temperature indications provided by the elements <b>182</b> can be used to calibrate the system <b>160</b> so that the horizontal lines <b>172</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> occur at the respective appropriate temperatures on the graph <b>170</b> (i.e., at the temperatures indicated by the respective elements <b>182</b>). The differential attenuation value adjustments described above should also position each of the lines <b>172</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> so that they each indicate the same temperature as indicated by the respective temperature sensing elements <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the connections <b>168</b> are used in the optical fiber <b>162</b>, then the graph <b>170</b> will also show that the system <b>160</b> is effectively blinded for a substantial length beyond each connection. For this reason, each storage apparatus <b>120</b> may have stored therein substantially more than the length of the optical fiber <b>162</b> for which the system <b>160</b> is blinded, so that the enhanced calibration benefits described above may also be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although the elements <b>182</b> have been described above as being positioned in the storage apparatuses <b>120</b>, and as being formed on the optical fiber <b>164</b>, other configurations and other types of temperature sensing elements may be used without departing from the principles of the invention. For example, the elements <b>182</b> could be positioned internal or external to the apparatuses <b>120</b>. The elements <b>182</b> could be optical, electrical, mechanical or other types of temperature sensing devices. Preferably, however, the elements <b>182</b> provide an indication of temperature which is independent of the distributed temperature sensing which is performed using the optical fiber <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Of course, a person skilled in the art would, upon a careful consideration of the above description of representative embodiments of the invention, readily appreciate that many modifications, additions, substitutions, deletions, and other changes may be made to these specific embodiments, and such changes are contemplated by the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as being given by way of illustration and example only, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited solely by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
