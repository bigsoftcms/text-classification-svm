<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a camera module, and more specifically to a camera module that can be used in small-sized electronic apparatuses such as digital cameras, camera-equipped cellular phones and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A camera module having a function of displacing a lens unit in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit is used in relatively small-sized digital cameras, camera-equipped cellular phones and the like. This function is used for providing an autofocus function and/or zoom function and the like, and is achieved by an interaction between a magnetic field generated by an electrical current flowing in a coil and a magnetic field generated by a yoke and magnets provided on the yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a camera module includes a barrel which holds the lens unit, a holder which houses the barrel therein, and a pair of leaf springs for supporting the holder so that the holder is displaceable in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit. Further, the camera module also includes lead wires (that is, both end portions of a wire of the coil) for supplying an electrical current to the coil provided around the holder which is displaceable in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an autofocus actuator assembly <b>100</b> used in a conventional camera module for displacing a lens unit (not shown) in a direction of an optical axis thereof. It is to be noted that an imaging element (not shown) is provided below a base <b>111</b> of the actuator assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A holder <b>108</b> that houses a barrel (not shown) holding the lens unit is provided in a space between a cover <b>101</b> and the base <b>111</b> so that the holder <b>108</b> is displaceable in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit together with the lens unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A ring-shaped inner annular portion <b>104</b><i>b </i>of an upper leaf spring <b>104</b> and a ring-shaped inner annular portion <b>110</b><i>b </i>of a lower leaf spring <b>110</b> are attached to the upper and lower cylindrical end portions of the holder <b>108</b>, respectively, using an adhesive. Further, an outer annular portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>104</b> is attached to a top surface of a yoke <b>105</b> and an outer annular portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>110</b> is provided on a lower end of the yoke <b>105</b>, respectively. Furthermore, on the upper surface of the inner annular portion <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the upper spring <b>104</b> which is attached to the upper cylindrical end portion of the holder <b>108</b>, a stopper denoted by the reference numeral <b>102</b> is attached using an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Three bridge portions <b>104</b><i>c </i>are coupled between the outer annular portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the inner annular portion <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>104</b>. As is the same with the upper leaf spring <b>104</b>, three bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c </i>are coupled between the outer annular portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the inner annular portion <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>110</b>. By resilient deformation of the respective three bridge portions <b>104</b><i>c </i>and <b>110</b><i>c, </i>the holder <b>108</b> can be displaced in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A plurality of magnets <b>106</b> are provided on the yoke <b>105</b> so as to produce a magnetic field. The yoke <b>105</b> has an axial bore <b>105</b><i>a </i>for receiving the holder <b>108</b>. Further, a coil <b>107</b> is provided around an outer periphery of the holder <b>108</b> so that the coil <b>7</b> is disposed in the magnetic field produced by the magnets and the yoke <b>105</b> in a state that the holder <b>108</b> is received in the axial bore <b>105</b><i>a. </i>By supplying a current to the coil <b>107</b> to generate a magnetic field, the holder <b>108</b> can be displaced in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit by a driving force generated by the interaction of the magnetic fields. In this regard, it is to be noted that a component donated by the reference numeral <b>109</b> is a ring-shaped plate provided between the lower leaf spring <b>110</b> and the lower end of the yoke <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A flexible printed circuit board <b>103</b> for supplying an electrical current to the coil <b>107</b> is provided below the outer annular portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>110</b>, and two lead wires (that is, both end portions of a wire of the coil) <b>103</b><i>a, </i><b>103</b><i>b </i>are extended from the coil <b>107</b> through notches <b>110</b><i>d, </i><b>110</b><i>d </i>formed on the inner periphery of the inner annular portion <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>110</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>). Tip ends of the lead wires <b>103</b><i>a, </i><b>103</b><i>b </i>are connected to pads <b>103</b><i>c, </i><b>103</b><i>d </i>of the flexible printed circuit board <b>103</b>, respectively. In more details, these lead wires <b>103</b><i>a, </i><b>103</b><i>b </i>are arranged below the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c </i>so as to extend through a predetermined space below the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c. </i>As described above, the outer annular portion <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the lower spring <b>110</b> is attached to the yoke <b>105</b> through the plate <b>109</b>, and the yoke <b>105</b> is electrically connected to a cover of a substrate (not shown) on which the camera module is to be mounted to thereby provide a ground therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is to be noted that an actuator assembly similar to the actuator assembly <b>100</b> described above is disclosed in JP-A-No. 2004-280031.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, the lead wires <b>103</b><i>a, </i><b>103</b><i>b </i>are arranged below the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c </i>so as to extend through a predetermined space below the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c. </i>In the camera module having the above structure, in the event that the electronic apparatus equipped with the camera module is dropped by accident and thus the holder <b>108</b> is abruptly displaced due to the shock, there is a case that the bridge portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>is largely deformed toward the corresponding lead wire to make severely contact with the lead wire to thereby damage an insulation coating of the lead wire. If such a damage of the insulation coating of the lead wire occurs and thereby the bridge portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>makes direct contact with a conductor of the lead wire, momentary shunt is caused between the lead wire and the ground through the lower leaf spring <b>110</b> and the yoke <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the conventional camera module described above, in order to prevent such undesirable damage of the lead wire, regions of the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c </i>which correspond to the lead wires <b>103</b><i>a, </i><b>103</b><i>b </i>are coated with an insulating resin such as silicone resin so that the insulation coating is not damaged by the deformed bridge portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>even in the case where the bridge portion makes severely contact with the lead wire.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the method mentioned above, it is necessary to carry out an application of the silicone resin or the like onto the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions <b>110</b><i>c </i>in the manufacturing process of the camera module. However, since the width of each bridge portion is extremely narrow, the application of the resin must be carried out carefully. Therefore, there is a problem in that it takes a relatively long time in manufacturing the camera module. Further, a cost of the synthetic resin must be included in a manufacturing cost of the camera module, thus leading to an increased manufacturing cost of the camera module.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been made in view of the problem described above, and therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a camera module which can be manufactured easily and in which a damage to a lead wire by a deformed bridge portion of a leaf spring can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to achieve the object, the present invention is directed to a camera module, which comprises: a lens unit which constitutes an optical system of the camera module; a holder which houses the lens unit and is displaceable along an optical axis direction of the lens unit, the holder having a cylindrical shape having upper and lower cylindrical end portions; a coil provided on the holder, the coil being formed from a wound wire having both end portions used as lead wires for supplying an electrical current to the coil; a yoke and magnets provided on the yoke for providing a magnetic field to the coil; a flexible printed circuit board to which the lead wires are connected for supplying an electrical current to the lead wires, the flexible printed circuit board having an insulating sheet portion and a pattern portion; upper and lower leaf springs for supporting the holder so that the holder is displaceable along an optical axis direction of the lens unit, each of the upper and lower springs including an outer annular portion, an inner annular portion provided inside the outer annular portion and attached to one of the cylindrical end portions of the holder, and a plurality of bridge portions coupled between the outer annular portion and the inner annular portion for displaceably supporting the inner annular portion with respect to the outer annular portion; and an imaging element provided below the lens unit. In the camera module described above, a part of the insulating sheet portion of the flexible printed circuit board is formed into a tongue part which extends in a tongue-shaped manner. The tongue part is arranged in a space between one of the bridge portions of the upper or lower leaf spring and the lead wires so that the bridge portion does not make contact with the lead wires even in the event that the bridge portion is hardly deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the camera module of the present invention having the above structure, even in the event that the holder is largely displaced and thus the bridge portion is deformed due to shock applied to the camera module, since the tongue part is arranged below the bridge portion, it is possible to prevent the deformed bridge portion from making direct contact with the lead wires. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the insulating coating of the lead wires from being damaged by the deformed bridge portion. Further, a process for applying a synthetic resin onto the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions of the lower leaf spring can be omitted, a time required for manufacturing the camera module can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the camera module of the present invention, it is preferred that the flexible printed circuit board is arranged below the lower leaf spring so that the tongue part extends substantially along with a predetermined bridge portion of the lower leaf spring.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in the camera module of the present invention, it is preferred that the tongue part is formed so as to cover almost of the lead wires.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention by way of example.</p>

On the base part of one of the three coil support portions <b>8</b><i>c, </i>an aperture <b>8</b><i>b </i>described later is formed. Further, on the bottom surface of each of the coil support portions <b>8</b><i>c, </i>there is formed a boss <b>8</b><i>b. </i>These bosses <b>8</b><i>b </i>extend through a space between the outer annular portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the inner annular portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>10</b>, and abut on the base <b>12</b> for applying a predetermined back tension to the upper and lower leaf springs <b>4</b> and <b>10</b>. As described above, the inner annular portion <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>4</b> is attached the upper cylindrical end portion of the holder <b>8</b> and the inner annular portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>10</b> is attached to the lower cylindrical end portion of the holder <b>8</b>, respectively. Further, the outer annular portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>4</b> is attached to a top surface of the yoke <b>5</b> provided on the base <b>12</b> and the outer annular portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>10</b> is attached to a lower end portion of the yoke <b>5</b> through an annular plate <b>19</b> (which will be described below in more detail). Furthermore, on the upper surface of the inner annular portion <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the upper spring <b>4</b> which is attached to the upper cylindrical end portion of the holder <b>8</b>, a stopper <b>3</b> is attached using an adhesive. This stopper <b>3</b> is provided for restricting upwardly excessive displacement of the holder <b>8</b> by the abutment with the bottom surface of the cover <b>2</b> when the holder <b>8</b> is largely displaced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each of the upper and lower leaf springs <b>4</b>, <b>10</b> is formed from a thin metal plate made of beryllium copper through a punching process, and has the ring-shaped outer annular portion <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>a </i>and the ring-shaped inner annular portion <b>4</b><i>b, </i><b>10</b><i>b </i>which is concentrically provided inside the outer annular portion <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>a </i>through an annular spacing. The inner annular portion <b>4</b><i>b, </i><b>10</b><i>b </i>is displaceably supported by the outer annular portion <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>a </i>through the bridge portions <b>4</b><i>c, </i><b>10</b><i>c. </i>Each of the bridge portions <b>4</b><i>c, </i><b>10</b><i>c </i>has an elongated arc-shape which extends along the inner periphery of the outer annular portion <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>a </i>and the outer periphery of the inner annular portion <b>4</b><i>b, </i><b>10</b><i>b </i>through a predetermined angle. By resilient deformation of the respective three bridge portions <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>10</b><i>c, </i>the holder <b>8</b> can be displaced in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The plurality of magnets <b>6</b> are bonded to the inner surface of the yoke <b>5</b> so as to produce a magnetic field. Further, the coil <b>7</b> is provided around an outer periphery of the holder <b>8</b> so that the coil <b>7</b> is disposed in the magnetic field generated by the magnets <b>6</b> and the yoke <b>5</b>. The yoke <b>7</b> has an axial bore <b>8</b><i>a </i>for receiving the holder <b>8</b>. The holder <b>8</b> can be displaced through the axial bore <b>8</b><i>a </i>in a direction of an optical axis of the lens unit by supplying an electrical current to the coil <b>7</b>. Further, the annular plate <b>9</b> made of a magnetic metal material is provided between the lower leaf spring <b>10</b> and the bottom surface of the yoke <b>5</b> for reducing leakage of magnetic fluxes from the magnets <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, the flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b> which supplies an electrical current to the coil <b>7</b> is provided below the outer annular portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the outer leaf spring <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the two lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>which are both end portions of the wire of the coil <b>7</b> are connected to pads <b>11</b><i>d, </i><b>11</b><i>c </i>of the flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b>, respectively. Note that the lead wire <b>11</b><i>a </i>is a lead wire for a positive side of the coil and the lead wire <b>11</b><i>b </i>is a lead wire for a negative side of the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">These lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>are extended from the coil <b>7</b> through an aperture <b>8</b><i>b </i>formed in the coil support portion <b>8</b><i>c, </i>and arranged below the bridge portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>so as to extend through a predetermined space between the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b. </i>Tip ends of the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>are connected to the pads <b>11</b><i>d, </i><b>11</b><i>e </i>of the flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b>. In this regard, please note that the outer annular portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the lower spring <b>10</b> is attached to the yoke <b>5</b> through the annular plate <b>9</b>, and the yoke <b>5</b> is electrically connected to a cover of a substrate (not shown) on which the camera module is mounted to thereby provide a ground therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b> is formed from a flexible printed circuit board having an insulating sheet portion and a pattern portion, and formed into a roughly L-shape. Such a flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b> is arranged below the lower leaf spring <b>10</b>. The flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the substrate on which the camera module is mounted so that an electrical current is supplied from the substrate to the coil <b>7</b> through the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A part of the insulating sheet portion of the flexible printed circuit board <b>11</b> is formed into a tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>which extends in a tongue-shaped manner. The tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>is arranged in a space between the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>so that the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>does not make contact with the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>even in the event that the bridge portion is largely deformed. Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>is provided so as to extend below the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>which is positioned in a region where the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>are arranged. In other words, the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>is provided so as to cover most of the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b. </i>In this regard, it is to be noted that a space is created between the bottom surface of the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the top surface of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>due to the back tension applied to the upper and lower leaf springs <b>4</b> and <b>10</b> as described above. Further, the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>extend in a space below the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>with a predetermined space being left with respect to the bottom surface of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c. </i>The space between the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the space between the bottom surface of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the lead wires <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b </i>are respectively set so that the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>does not make contact with the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>does not make contact with the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>when the holder <b>8</b> is displaced by supplying an electrical current to the coil <b>7</b>. Further, in the event that the holder <b>8</b> is largely displaced and thus the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>is deformed due to shock applied to the camera module. However, in such a case, since the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>is arranged below the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c, </i>it is possible to prevent the deformed bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>from making direct contact with the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b. </i>Therefore, it is possible to prevent the insulating coating of the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>from being damaged by the deformed bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the camera module having the above structure, an application of the silicone resin to the bridge portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>that was carried out in the manufacturing process of the conventional camera module becomes unnecessary, thereby leading to a reduced manufacturing cost of the camera module. Further, a process for applying the silicone resin onto the bottom surfaces of the bridge portions of the lower leaf spring can be omitted, a time required for manufacturing the camera module can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>extends only in a region where the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>are arranged. This makes it possible to design the tongue part <b>11</b> so as to have a minimum area necessary for preventing direct contact between the deformed bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b. </i>This reduced area of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>makes it possible to further reduce manufacturing cost of the camera module.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the above embodiment is directed to the case where the bridge portion <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the lower leaf spring <b>10</b> is insulated from the lead wires <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b </i>by means of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c, </i>the present invention is not limited thereto. The present invention may be applied to the case where lead wires are arranged near the bridge portion <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the upper leaf spring <b>4</b>. Further, the shape and size of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>described above is mere one example, and thus it goes without saying that the shape and size of the tongue part <b>11</b><i>c </i>may be changed appropriately according to the structure of a camera module and the shape of a bridge portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, it is also to be understood that the present disclosure relates to subject matter contained in Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-249708 (filed on Sep. 14, 2006) which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
