<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase Application under 35 USC 371 of International Application PCT/SE2004/001896 filed Dec. 16, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a device simulating a screw joint and intended for repeated test running power nut runners and comprises a screw, a main body with a nut, and a spring unit to be compressed when rotating the screw in the tightening the tightening direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Power nut runner test devices of the above type have been used for a long time but have an inherent weakness, namely that when running a number of test tightening operations of the screw will end up in the very same angular position each time the power nut runner reaches the set final torque level. This is a drawback, because the gear transmission of the nut runner will also be in the very same position each time the final torque level is reached. Due to the fact that the transmission gears, angle gears in particular, always involve some irregularities and that, accordingly, the torque output from the nut runner is not perfectly even over a full output shaft revolution, and the actually obtained torque magnitude varies with the angular position of the output shaft at the attainment of the set final torque level. This means in turn that when setting the final torque on the nut runner the torque level might be too high or too low.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The main object of the invention is to provide a nut runner test device where the angular end position of the screw and, hence, the angular position of the output shaft of the nut runner will vary randomly from one test run to another, thereby making it possible to determine a mean value of the obtained output torque which will be more accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further objects and advantages of the invention will appear from the following specification.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The test device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a main body <b>10</b> with a nut <b>11</b>, a screw <b>12</b> with a nut runner engaging hexagonal head <b>13</b>, a clamping element <b>14</b> engaged by the screw head <b>13</b> via a washer <b>16</b>, and a spring unit <b>17</b>. The spring unit <b>17</b> comprises a number of stacked Belleville-type spring washers <b>18</b> which are kept together by a sleeve shaped cage <b>19</b> and supported on the main body <b>10</b> via number of axially directed dogs <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The main body <b>10</b> has a central bore <b>21</b> for receiving the screw <b>12</b> and a co-axial socket portion <b>22</b> in which the nut <b>11</b> is received. In the socket portion <b>22</b>, between the nut and the main body <b>10</b>, there is provided a roller-type one-way clutch <b>24</b>. This one-way clutch <b>24</b> is arranged to lock the nut <b>11</b> against rotation in a step-less manner when the screw <b>12</b> is rotated in its tightening direction and permit rotation of the nut <b>11</b> when the screw <b>12</b> is rotated in its loosening direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The clamping element <b>14</b> is formed with an annular shoulder <b>26</b> for engaging the spring unit <b>17</b> and having a tubular extension <b>27</b> which forms a radial support for the spring unit <b>17</b>. Between the clamping element <b>14</b> and the main body <b>10</b> and in parallel with the spring unit <b>17</b> there is inserted an auxiliary spring <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A friction brake <b>30</b> is arranged between the nut <b>11</b> and the main body <b>10</b> and comprises an axially facing contact surface <b>31</b> on the main body <b>10</b> and an oppositely facing contact surface <b>32</b> on the nut <b>11</b>. These two contact surfaces <b>31</b>,<b>32</b> are biassed into engagement with each other by the auxiliary spring <b>28</b> and also by the spring unit <b>17</b>, as long as the latter is compressed by the screw <b>12</b>. The screw <b>12</b> carries a lock element <b>34</b> in the form of a lock ring the purpose of which is to engage the nut <b>11</b> and lock together the screw <b>12</b> and the nut <b>11</b> in a position where the compression of the spring unit <b>17</b> has ceased.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The operation order of the device is described as follows. A nut runner test running process is started in that the screw <b>12</b> is rotated in its tightening direction by means of the nut runner applied on the head <b>13</b>. By its co-operation with the nut <b>11</b> the screw <b>12</b> starts to move downwards in the drawing figure, whereby the head <b>13</b> gets into contact with the clamping element <b>14</b> via the washer <b>16</b>. Due to the locking action of the one-way clutch <b>24</b> the nut <b>11</b> is kept stationary relative to the main body <b>10</b>. At continued rotation of the screw <b>12</b> in the tightening direction the clamping element <b>14</b> starts compressing the spring unit <b>17</b>, whereby an increasing reaction torque in the screw <b>12</b> is generated. The tightening process is continued until a pre-set final torque level is reached. The nut runner is shut off, and the torque magnitude actually obtained is detected by a non-illustrated torque sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The test running cycle is completed by the screw <b>12</b> being rotated in its opposite direction to relieve the clamping load on the spring unit <b>17</b>. However, as long as the spring unit <b>17</b> is compressed it accomplishes a contact force between the contact surfaces <b>31</b>,<b>23</b> of the friction brake <b>30</b>, which means that the nut <b>11</b> is frictionally locked to the main body <b>10</b> during the loosening rotation of the screw <b>12</b>. In other words, it is of no significance that the one-way clutch <b>24</b> permits rotation of the nut <b>11</b> in the loosening direction of the screw <b>12</b>, because the friction brake <b>30</b> still locks the nut <b>11</b> relative to the main body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At continued rotation of the screw <b>12</b> in the loosening direction the spring unit <b>17</b> becomes unloaded and ceases to exert a contact pressure on the friction brake <b>30</b>. Due to the action of the auxiliary spring <b>28</b>, however, there is still a contact pressure acting on the friction brake <b>24</b> such that the screw <b>12</b> can be rotated some more in its loosening direction without the nut <b>11</b> starts rotating. When at last the screw <b>12</b> reaches a position where the lock ring <b>34</b> engages the nut <b>11</b> the screw <b>12</b> becomes rotationally locked relative to the nut <b>11</b> with a force that overrules the friction force of the brake <b>24</b>. This means that the nut <b>11</b> will start rotating relative to the main body <b>10</b> together with the screw <b>12</b> until the nut runner is shut off.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this position the head <b>13</b> has separated from the clamping element <b>14</b> and a new test run may be started. When starting a new test running process, the screw <b>12</b> is rotated in its tightening direction, and the one-way clutch <b>24</b> will immediately lock the nut <b>11</b> relative to the main body <b>10</b> and enabling tightening of the screw <b>12</b> with compression of the spring unit <b>17</b> as a consequence. Due to the fact that the nut <b>11</b> was locked to the screw <b>12</b> during the final rotation of the screw <b>12</b> in the loosening direction the nut <b>11</b> was brought to rotate a certain angle relative to the main body <b>10</b>. When starting the new tightening operation the one-way clutch will re-engage a random angular position relative to the main body <b>10</b>, which means that the final position of the screw <b>12</b> when reaching the final torque level will not be the same as the final position in the foregoing tightening operation. This means that the final torque level is reached with the rotating parts of the nut runner transmission in different positions, and the actually obtained torque magnitude will most probably be somewhat different from the magnitude of the previous tightening process. After a number of test runs it is possible to determine the deviation range of the obtained output torque, and a mean value of all test results may be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The test device illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> is quite similar to the one described above and comprises main body <b>50</b> with a cup-shaped section <b>51</b> fixed to its lower end, a screw <b>52</b> extending through a central bore <b>53</b> in the main body <b>50</b> and co-operating with a nut <b>54</b>. The screw <b>52</b> has a hexagonal head <b>55</b> for engaging a clamping element <b>56</b> via a steel washer <b>57</b>. A number of stacked Belleville-type spring washers <b>58</b> form a spring unit <b>59</b> which is inserted between a shoulder <b>61</b> on the clamping element <b>56</b> and a support ring <b>62</b> on the main body <b>10</b>. A sleeve shaped cage <b>60</b> maintains the spring washers together. Between the clamping element <b>56</b> and the main body <b>50</b> there is also provided an auxiliary spring <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the cup-shaped end section <b>51</b> of the main body <b>50</b> there is arranged a step-less one-way clutch <b>64</b> comprising a circular leaf spring element <b>66</b> with a bent end portion <b>67</b> received in a slot <b>68</b> in the end section <b>51</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The leaf spring element <b>66</b> is provided with a number of friction shoes <b>69</b> for co-operation with the outer surface of the nut <b>54</b>. This clutch <b>64</b> is arranged to lock the nut <b>54</b> against rotation when rotating the screw <b>52</b> in the tightening direction, but permit rotation of the nut <b>54</b> when rotating the screw <b>52</b> in the loosening direction. The locking action of the clutch <b>64</b> is accomplished by a self tightening action of the leaf spring element <b>66</b> when the nut <b>54</b> is rotated, or is attempted to be rotated, in the tightening direction of the screw <b>52</b>, i.e. clock-wise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The spring element <b>66</b> is wrapped tight onto the nut <b>54</b> and generates a locking action via the friction shoes <b>69</b>. When rotating the nut <b>54</b> in the opposite direction the spring element <b>66</b> opens up and unlocks the nut <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At its lower end, the screw <b>52</b> is provided with a stop member <b>70</b> which will co-operate with the nut <b>54</b> and limits the axial movement of the screw <b>52</b> in the loosening direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As in the above described embodiment a friction brake <b>71</b> including contact surfaces <b>72</b>,<b>73</b> is provided on the nut <b>54</b> and the main body <b>50</b> to prevent rotation of the nut <b>54</b> until the stop member <b>70</b> positively locks the nut <b>54</b> to the screw <b>52</b>. During the first part of the screw rotation in the loosening direction, the axial load of the spring unit <b>59</b> generates a friction force locking the nut <b>54</b> to the main body <b>50</b>. When the spring unit <b>59</b> is completely unloaded, the auxiliary spring <b>63</b> generates a friction force strong enough to prevent the nut <b>54</b> from rotating, but as soon as the stop member <b>70</b> engages the nut <b>54</b> the latter is forced to rotate in the loosening direction of the screw <b>52</b>.</p>
