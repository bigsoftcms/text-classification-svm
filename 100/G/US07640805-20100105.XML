<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are integrated sensors, actuators, and electronics fabricated with processes similar to those used for integrated circuits. They integrate mechanical elements (such as sensors and actuators) with electronics on a common substrate through microfabrication technology. They convert physical parameters to or from electrical signals, and depend on mechanical structures or parameters in important ways for their operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">MEMS devices use a sensor with sensing circuitry and/or an actuation device with drive circuitry to detect or produce physical phenomenon. MEMS sensors gather information by measuring any combination of mechanical, thermal, biological, chemical, optical, and magnetic phenomena. Electronics then process the information derived from the sensors, and through some decision making capability can direct the actuators to respond. Non-limiting responses include moving, positioning, regulating, pumping, and filtering, thereby controlling the environment for some desired outcome or purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Early MEMS devices were used as accelerometers for automobile crash airbag deployment systems. Now, MEMS accelerometers are quickly replacing conventional accelerometers for crash airbag deployment systems in automobiles. The conventional approach uses several bulky accelerometers made of discrete components mounted in the front of the car with separate electronics near the airbag. MEMS made it possible to integrate the accelerometer and electronics onto a single silicon chip. MEMS accelerometers are therefore much smaller, more functional, lighter, more reliable, and are produced for a fraction of the cost of the conventional macroscale accelerometer elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">MEMS can now be used in many other ways. Other non-limiting examples include pressure sensors, microvalves, and gyroscopes. They have applications in many areas, including health care, industrial automation (including automated semiconductor manufacturing), automotive systems (both vehicles and smart highways), global environmental monitoring, environmental controls, defense, and a wide variety of consumer products.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">MEMS devices can also be used as switches in fiber optic networks. A MEMS optical switch includes at least one input port in optical communication with the proof-mass and at least one output port in optical communication with the proof-mass. The proof-mass directs light from at least one input port to at least one output port. When an electrostatic potential is applied to the at least one top and bottom electrodes, an electrostatic force is generated which causes the proof-mass to move and direct the light from at least one input port to at least one output port. The proof-mass then remains static until the light path needs to be redirected. In certain embodiments the proof-mass may form at least one mirror, at least one partially reflective mirror, and/or at least one diffraction grating. The proof-mass may be transparent to at least one wavelength of light. In other embodiments the device further contains at least one optical coating disposed on the proof-mass. The at least one optical coating may form at least one mirror, at least one partially reflective mirror, and/or at least one diffraction grating. The at least one optical coating can be conductive or non-conductive, and can be transparent to at least one wavelength of light. In certain embodiments the input and output ports may be fiber optic lines. These mirror-based switches can be two-dimensional, where they move up and down or left and right, or three-dimensional, where they can swivel in a broad range of movement. In other embodiments, the optical switch can be employed in an array, with up to thousands on a single chip. The result is an end-to-end photonic network which is more reliable and cost-effective, and has minimal performance drop-off. Additional applications include active sources, tunable filters, variable optical attenuators, and gain equalization and dispersion compensation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">MEMS devices are manufactured using batch fabrication techniques similar to those used for integrated circuits. Micro-mechanical components are fabricated using processes that selectively etch away parts of the silicon wafer or add new structural layers to form the mechanical and/or electromechanical devices. MEMS devices may contain a sensor device that makes use of a proof-mass suspended structure, and sensing circuitry that is commonly formed using typical semiconductor-type fabrication processes.

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Fabrication processes for existing MEMS devices are inefficient and costly due to the combination of individual steps required to fabricate a single device. Additionally, while electronic signal processing is increasingly being used in MEMS&#x2014;in sensors, actuators, and integrated electronics, existing MEMS applications are limited in that they have relatively low levels of electromechanical integration and little interaction with mechanical components working alone or together to enable a complex action. For example, in a typical integrated circuit, the circuitry and the proof-mass suspended structure are formed on separate semiconductor layers. While the electronics are fabricated using integrated circuit (IC) process sequences (e.g., CMOS, Bipolar, or BICMOS processes), the micro-mechanical components are fabricated using compatible &#x201c;micromachining&#x201d; processes that selectively etch away parts of the silicon wafer or add new structural layers to form the mechanical and electromechanical devices. Therefore, the integration of on-chip circuits and proof-mass suspended structures usually require additional deposited layers or are built on a separate die.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a need exists for MEMS products with greater levels of electrical-mechanical integration. To satisfy this need for increasing levels of integration in MEMS devices, monolithic chips or multichip modules need to be developed. These monolithic devices would integrate sensing, driving, controlling, and signal processing electronics into fewer layers on a substrate. This integration promises to improve the performance of micro-mechanical devices, as well as reduce the cost of manufacturing, packaging, and instrumentation for these devices, by combining the micro-mechanical devices with an electronic sub-system in the same manufacturing and packaging process.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a proof-mass <b>120</b> supported by springs <b>130</b> containing a mechanical layer <b>132</b> which further contains a conductive layer <b>136</b> and an insulating layer <b>134</b>. At least one bottom conductive electrode <b>150</b> beneath the at least one spring <b>130</b> can be used to actuate the proof-mass <b>120</b> or sense movement of the proof-mass <b>120</b> in response to an external force or motion. The drive/sense circuitry <b>112</b> is located on the substrate <b>110</b> and fabricated at the same time as the at least one spring <b>130</b>. The proof-mass system <b>100</b> can be any shape and can be sub-divided into any number of regions. In the embodiment shown, the proof-mass system <b>100</b> has four unique sets of top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> defining four regions (A, B, C, and D). Regions A and C are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The proof-mass <b>120</b> is formed by separating from a substrate <b>110</b> a region made entirely or in part of silicon, polysilicon, semiconductor dielectric material(s), or metal. In certain embodiments, the proof-mass <b>120</b> has a thickness no greater than the substrate <b>110</b>. The proof-mass <b>120</b> may be released from the substrate <b>110</b> using standard MEMS etch techniques. Two etching techniques are wet etching and dry plasma etching. MEMS etch techniques may include the removal of material from the substrate <b>110</b> until the desired structure of the proof-mass <b>120</b> is achieved. Once released, no further process etching is applied to the proof-mass <b>120</b>. The proof-mass <b>120</b> can be formed in any shape. The proof-mass <b>120</b> may be shaped either before or during the release process. In certain embodiments, the shape of the proof-mass <b>120</b> is defined by the release process. The top surface <b>122</b> and/or other surfaces of the proof-mass <b>120</b> may have a combination of metal and oxide layers, and may have additional coatings depending upon the specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the proof-mass <b>120</b> is suspended by at least one elastic device. The at least one elastic device contains at least one conductive layer <b>136</b>. Some or all of the material surrounding the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> is removed. The remaining material surrounding the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> forms at least one insulating layer <b>134</b>. Once the material beneath the at least one elastic device is removed, the at least one elastic device is free to move in at least one of the x-, y-, and z-directions. At least one anchor <b>128</b> establishes a mechanical connection between the at least one elastic device and the proof-mass <b>120</b>. The mechanical connection between the at least one anchor <b>128</b> and the at least one elastic device is established by forming the at least one anchor <b>128</b> in the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> of the at least one elastic device using standard MEMS etching techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In certain embodiments, springs <b>130</b> can be used as elastic devices. In certain other embodiments, springs <b>130</b> form a network of spring supports. The springs <b>130</b> may contain but are not limited to serpentine loops, mesh patterns, crab-leg flexures, folded flexures, or simple beams. Regions of springs <b>130</b> may be designed to respond to a force or movement in a specific direction. The springs <b>130</b> may contain a mechanical layer <b>132</b> and at least one conductive layer <b>136</b>. The mechanical layer <b>132</b> includes any or all of the following: an insulating layer <b>134</b>, such as silicon oxide and/or silicon nitride, or other semiconductor dielectric material(s), to prevent shorting between the top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>; and a conductive layer <b>136</b> made of metal or polysilicon that may be electrically isolated from the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. The mechanical layer <b>132</b> connects the proof-mass <b>120</b> to the die (not shown) while suspending the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b> above the at least one bottom conductive electrode <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b> is located beneath the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b>. The top conductive electrode <b>140</b> may be encased in an insulating material (not shown). In other embodiments, the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> may function as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. In still other embodiments, the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b> is not present at all. The top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> can be made of metal and/or polysilicon, or may be formed as a doped region within the substrate <b>110</b>. An air gap separates the springs <b>130</b> and the at least one bottom electrode <b>150</b>. The air gap may be created by etching silicon, polysilicon, and/or semiconductor dielectric material(s) beneath the springs <b>130</b>. The at least one bottom conductive electrode <b>150</b> is located beneath the springs <b>130</b>. An initial capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>is generated between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>. The initial capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> can increase or decrease depending on the direction of applied force.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">This capacitance is sensed differentially with on-chip electronics (not shown). The on-chip electronics and the MEMS drive/sense circuitry are fabricated in the same layers to reduce parasitic capacitance. Parasitic capacitance reduces the effectiveness of capacitive sensor/actuator conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy and vice versa. By fabricating the on-chip electronics and MEMS drive/sense circuitry in the same layers, the electro-mechanical interface is more tightly coupled than if the mechanical structure were fabricated on a separate die, or with layers not used in the drive/sense circuitry. This tighter coupling reduces the parasitic capacitance between the MEMS drive/sense circuitry and the on-chip electronics input/output to levels below what is achievable using separate dies or additional layers to form the mechanical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a plan view of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> with the anchor <b>128</b>, springs <b>130</b>, and the at least one top electrode <b>140</b> omitted for clarity. It shows the proof-mass <b>120</b>, the proof-mass top surface <b>122</b>, regions A, B, C, and D of the at least one bottom electrode <b>150</b> separated by portions of the substrate <b>110</b>. Even though the proof-mass system <b>100</b> shown has four unique sets of top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> defining four regions (A, B, C, and D), the proof-mass system <b>100</b> can be any shape and can be sub-divided into any number of regions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a spring-supported proof-mass <b>120</b> moving in response to an external force F<sub>z </sub>or acceleration in the negative z-direction. In the embodiment shown, the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> functions as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. The initial capacitances C<sub>0 </sub>between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> can increase or decrease depending on the direction of applied force. The suspended proof-mass <b>120</b> and springs <b>130</b> move away from the substrate <b>110</b>. As the distance between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> increases, the capacitance between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> decreases in all four regions. These changes can be sensed by electronics (not shown) located on the substrate <b>110</b>. The common mode sum of these capacitance changes represents the z-component of the force F<sub>z</sub>. No differential signal is produced in the x- and y-directions, as the differential term that represents the x- and y-components cancel out to zero. The arrangement of the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> is exemplary only, and not limited to the arrangement shown. In another embodiment, a force F<sub>z </sub>in the negative z-direction can be sensed by an increase in the capacitance in all four regions using an arrangement where the distance between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> decreases in response to a force in the negative z-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a spring-supported proof-mass <b>120</b> moving in response to an external force F<sub>x </sub>or acceleration in the positive x-direction, with the proof-mass <b>120</b> center of mass located in a plane defined by the springs <b>130</b>. In the embodiment shown, the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> functions as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. With the proof-mass <b>120</b> center of mass located in a plane defined by the springs <b>130</b>, a force F<sub>x </sub>or acceleration in the positive x-direction produces a lateral movement of the proof-mass <b>120</b> in the positive x-direction. The initial capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>generated between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> increases or decreases depending on the direction of the applied force. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> the capacitance decreases in region A as the area between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region A decreases, and the capacitance in increases region C as the area between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region C increases. These changes can be sensed differentially by electronics (not shown) located on the substrate <b>110</b>. As there is no y-component or z-component to the force F<sub>x </sub>shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B, any changes to the capacitances in regions B and D (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) differentially cancel out to zero. The arrangement of the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> is exemplary only, and not limited to the arrangement shown. In another embodiment, movement in the positive x-direction can be sensed by an increase in the capacitance in region A and a decrease in the capacitance in region C, using an arrangement where a movement in the positive x-direction causes the area between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region A to increase and the area between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region C to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a spring-supported proof-mass <b>120</b> moving in response to an external force F<sub>x </sub>or acceleration in the positive x-direction, with the proof-mass <b>120</b> center of mass located outside a plane defined by the springs <b>130</b>. In the embodiment shown, the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> functions as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. With the proof-mass <b>120</b> center of mass located outside a plane defined by the springs <b>130</b>, a force F<sub>x </sub>or acceleration in the positive x-direction produces a rotation of the proof-mass <b>120</b>, as well as a lateral movement of the proof-mass <b>120</b> in the positive x-direction. The initial capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>generated between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> decreases in region A and increases in region C. These changes can be sensed differentially by electronics (not shown) located on the substrate <b>110</b>. The arrangement of the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> is exemplary only, and not limited to the arrangement shown. In another embodiment, movement in the positive x-direction can be sensed by an increase in the capacitance in region A and a decrease in the capacitance in region C. As there is no y- or z-component to the force shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, any changes to the capacitances in regions B and D (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) differentially cancel out to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a spring-supported proof-mass <b>120</b> moving in response to an electrostatic force generated between the at least one top and bottom conductive electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region C. In the embodiment shown, the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> functions as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. The electrostatic force can be used to move the suspended proof-mass <b>120</b>. The electrostatic force is generated by creating an electrostatic potential between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>. In the embodiment shown the at least one conductive layer <b>136</b> also functions as the at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b>. The at least one top conductive electrode <b>140</b> is encased in an insulating mechanical layer <b>132</b> to avoid shorting when the at least one top electrode <b>140</b> is attracted toward the at least one bottom electrode <b>150</b>. In the embodiment shown the electrostatic potential created between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in region C generates an electrostatic force in the negative z-direction, rotating the suspended proof-mass <b>120</b> and moving it laterally in the positive x-direction. The movement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is exemplary only, and not limited to what is shown. An electrostatic potential can be created between the at least one top and bottom electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> in other combinations to generate an electrostatic force that can rotate and/or move the proof-mass <b>120</b> in any direction. In certain embodiments, the rotation and/or movement can include a direction along at least one of the x-, y-, and z-axes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may function as an optical switch to direct light <b>200</b> from one fiber to another. At least one optical coating <b>124</b> disposed on the proof-mass <b>120</b> directs light <b>200</b> for optical applications. The at least one optical coating <b>124</b> can be conductive or non-conductive. The at least one optical coating <b>124</b> can form a reflective mirror, a partially reflective mirror, or contain slits to form a diffraction grating. The at least one optical coating <b>124</b> can be optically transparent to specific light wavelengths. Though shown with the at least one optical coating <b>124</b> disposed on the proof-mass <b>120</b> top surface <b>122</b>, the at least one optical coating <b>124</b> can be disposed on only a portion of the top surface <b>122</b>, on another surface of the proof-mass, or on a portion of another surface of the proof-mass <b>120</b>. In other embodiments the proof-mass <b>120</b> may be used in combination with an optical coating <b>124</b> to direct light <b>200</b>. In still other embodiments, the proof-mass <b>120</b> itself directs light <b>200</b>, and an optical coating <b>124</b> is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The optical switch further includes at least one input port <b>210</b> in optical communication with the proof-mass <b>120</b>, and at least one output port <b>220</b> in optical communication with the proof-mass <b>120</b>. When the proof-mass <b>120</b> moves, it directs light <b>200</b> to at least one output port <b>220</b>. The proof-mass <b>120</b> then remains static until the light <b>200</b> need to be redirected. The proof-mass <b>120</b> then moves again to redirect the light <b>200</b>. The number and location of the at least one input port <b>210</b> and the at least one output port <b>220</b> are exemplary only, and can vary in other embodiments as long as they remain in optical communication with the proof-mass <b>120</b> and/or at least one optical coating <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the at least one input and at least one output ports <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be fiber optic lines in optical communication with the proof-mass <b>120</b> and/or at least one optical coating <b>124</b>. These optical switches can be two-dimensional, where they move up and down or left and right, or three-dimensional, where they can swivel in a broad range of movement. In other embodiments, the optical switch can be employed in an array, with up to thousands on a single chip. The result is an end-to-end photonic network that is more reliable and cost-effective, and has minimal performance drop-off.</p>

In this embodiment, the springs <b>130</b> in regions A and C of the proof-mass <b>120</b> are designed to respond to forces along the x- and z-directions, while the springs <b>130</b> in regions B and D respond to forces in the y- and z-directions.

The springs <b>130</b> can be distributed and grouped in other ways depending on the specific application. In certain embodiments, the proof-mass <b>120</b> includes at least one spring <b>130</b> on each side. In other embodiments, two or more springs can be used on each side.
