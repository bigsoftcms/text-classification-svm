<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to automated banking machines that are activated responsive to user cards. Specifically exemplary embodiments relate to a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automated banking machines are known in the prior art. Popular automated banking machines often used by consumers are automated teller machines (ATMs). ATMs are increasingly used by consumers to conduct banking transactions. Common banking transactions conducted by consumers at ATMs include deposits, withdrawals, account transfers, and balance inquiries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most ATMs include a secure enclosure which is also referred to as a chest portion. The secure enclosure is used to hold currency and other valuable items inside the machine. Deposits made by customers into an ATM are also preferably held within a secure enclosure until they can be removed by authorized personnel. The secure enclosure also preferably houses portions of the mechanisms used for receiving deposits and dispensing currency. The secure enclosure also preferably houses electronic components of the ATM which may be subject to attack by someone attempting to compromise the security of the ATM or the electronic communications network in which it is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Secure enclosures for automated banking machines include, in connection with a moveable door, a locking bolt work apparatus. The locking bolt work is generally in a secure, locking condition when the door is closed. When authorized personnel act to open the door of the secure enclosure, such as by inputting a proper combination to a lock, the locking bolt work is moveable to a second unsecured condition. In the second condition of the bolt work, the door is enabled to be opened so that components within the secure enclosure can be accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Automated banking machines, and particularly the secure enclosures thereof, may benefit from improvements.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there exists a need for a secure enclosure and a method of manufacturing a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that is more reliable and economical.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There also exists a need for a locking bolt work apparatus for a door of an automated banking machine that provides enhanced security, but which is also economical with low complexity and which can be quickly opened by authorized personnel. There further exists the need for a method of assembling the locking bolt work apparatus to a secure enclosure that can be readily accomplished in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There also exists a need for a system and method for mounting a door on a secure enclosure of an automated banking machine that more readily accomplished. There further exists a need for a system and method for mounting a door on a secure enclosure of an automated banking machine in which a hinge does not pose a weak point that is vulnerable to attack by burglars. There further exists a need for a system and method for mounting a door on a secure enclosure of an automated banking machine that can be done despite misalignment of hinges which support the door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There also exists a need for an automated banking machine with a secure chest portion that includes a chest door that is more resistant to being opened if criminals successfully compromise the hinges and attempt to deform the chest housing and/or chest door.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that is more readily accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that is more accurate and reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that can provide enhanced security.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that includes a more secure bolt work apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that includes a bolt work apparatus that may be more readily installed in the secure enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that includes a moveable door mounted on multiple hinges that enable the door to be properly mounted and positioned despite misalignment of the hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further object of an exemplary embodiment to provide a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine in which the hinges, which are used to mount the moveable door on the enclosure, are less vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosures of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/453,647 filed Mar. 10, 2003 and 60/453,667 filed Mar. 10, 2003 and 60/494,614 filed Aug. 11, 2003 are incorporated herein by reference as are the disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,063,254; 7,062,464; 7,032,245; 7,025,255; and 7,021,529.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further objects of exemplary embodiments will be made apparent in the following Best Modes for Carrying Out Invention and the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing objects are accomplished in an exemplary embodiment by a secure enclosure for an automated banking machine that includes a bolt work apparatus. In the exemplary embodiment the automated banking machine is an ATM; For purposes of this description an automated banking machine shall be considered to include any device that accomplishes transfers of value. Precisely positioned openings extend through the secure enclosure. The openings enable cooperation between devices and mechanisms inside and outside of the enclosure, which enables the conducting of banking transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The exemplary secure enclosure comprises a safe chest portion including panels and a moveable chest door. The chest includes a front panel. The front panel is connected to a hinge side panel and a parallel spaced striker or lock side panel. The striker side panel further includes a plurality of vertically aligned apertures therethrough. The chest further includes a top panel and a parallel, spaced bottom panel. An opening to the chest extends on a side opposite the front panel when the door is in an open position. Each of the panels preferably includes precisely positioned access openings for cooperating with the components which make up the ATM.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The door and secure chest portion have corresponding hinge portions. The construction of the hinge assemblies enables the door to be mounted on the chest despite minor misalignment of the hinge pins. Components of the hinge assemblies are adjustable to correct alignment of the door relative to the chest. The hinge assembly components enable the door to be adjusted in both up-down and right-left directions. Vertical adjustment of the door can be accomplished by adjusting an up-down set screw in the door hinge portion to move the door in an up-down direction. Horizontal adjustment of the door can be accomplished by adjusting right-left set screws in the chest hinge portion to pivot the hinge pin and move the door in a right-left direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The door has mounted thereon a locking bolt work apparatus or mechanism. The locking bolt work mechanism is moveable responsive to the condition of a lock, between a secure and an open condition. The bolt work mechanism includes a moveable locking bolt with a plurality of locking bolt projections. In the secure condition of the locking bolt, the locking bolt projections extend in the apertures in the striker side panel of the chest. In the open condition the locking bolt projections are retracted from the apertures enabling movement of the door to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The exemplary locking bolt is moveable in response to an actuating mechanism. The actuating mechanism includes a drive cam. The drive cam is operative to be secured by the lock and is operative to be moved by a door handle when the lock is in an open condition. The drive cam is connected by a generally vertically extending long link to an idler cam. The drive cam and the idler cam are each rotatably moveable and positioned adjacent to a respective vertical end of the locking bolt. The locking bolt is connected to the drive cam by a generally horizontally extending short link. The locking bolt is also connected to the idler cam by another generally horizontally extending short link.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the secure condition of the locking bolt, the drive cam and the idler cam are in adjacent abutting position with the locking bolt. In addition, an alignment device is operative to rotatably align the drive cam with the lock to enable locking of the drive cam. The alignment device can act as a stop to prevent further movement of the drive cam in a first rotational direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In response to unlocking the lock by authorized personnel, the drive cam of the actuating mechanism is enabled to be rotated. The drive cam can be rotated to cause rotation of the idler cam through the long link. The drive cam and the idler cam can be rotated together in a direction that results in the short links moving the locking bolt in an inward unlocking direction. The locking bolt is enabled to move sufficiently to disengage from the apertures in the striker side panel of the chest which enables opening of the door. Thus, the exemplary locking bolt work mechanism when arranged with a secure chest door enables the drive cam to be rotated in a first direction and a second direction to move the locking bolt relative to the door between an extended door-secured position and a retracted door-open position, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an exemplary embodiment the chest door further includes in supporting connection therewith a dead bolt portion. The dead bolt portion extends on an opposed side of the chest door from the striker side. An exemplary dead bolt in the closed position of the door extends within an aperture in supporting connection with the hinge side of the chest. In exemplary embodiments the door includes a plurality of dead bolt portions, each of which extend in an respective aperture in the closed position of the chest door. When the door is rotationally moved from the closed position to the open position, after the locking bolt has been retracted, the bolt portions on the hinge side of the door each rotate out of their respective apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the closed and locked position of the chest door the dead bolt portions each extend inwardly and behind an engaging surface which in exemplary embodiments bound the aperture. Attempted deformation of the door outwardly such as by a criminal who has compromised the hinges, is resisted by engagement of the dead bolt portion and the engaging surface. Exemplary embodiments include angled face portions on the dead bolt portion and engaging surface. The angled face portions are configured so that if the chest door and/or engaging surface are deformed in a manner which results in engagement of the surfaces, the angled face portions engage and resist separation of the bolt portion and the engaging surface. Various approaches may be used to facilitate a locking engagement of adjacent components so as to resist forced removal of the chest door and better secure the cash and other valuable items housed in an interior area of the chest portion of the ATM.</p>

No. 10/688,619 filed Oct. 17, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The exemplary secure enclosure <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a generally rectangular chest portion <b>12</b> and a moveable chest door <b>14</b>. The chest portion <b>12</b> bounds an interior area <b>16</b> which has an opening <b>18</b> at a rear side of the chest. Door <b>14</b> is sized for closing opening <b>18</b>. The chest door <b>14</b> is movably mounted to the chest <b>12</b>. Door <b>14</b> is removably attached to chest <b>12</b> by an upper hinge assembly <b>20</b> and a lower hinge assembly <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Door <b>14</b> has mounted thereon a locking bolt mechanism <b>23</b>. Door <b>14</b> further includes a dead bolt portion <b>26</b>. The locking bolt mechanism <b>23</b> and the dead bolt portion <b>26</b> are operative to secure the door in position closing opening <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> the chest portion of the exemplary secure enclosure includes a front panel <b>28</b>. Front panel <b>28</b>, in the embodiment shown, faces the customer side of the ATM. The front panel <b>28</b> includes openings <b>30</b>. The openings <b>30</b> are sized for cooperating with mechanisms in the ATM. These mechanisms include, for example, a cash dispenser mechanism that delivers cash or other valuable items to a customer. For example, a supply of cash may be maintained within the secure enclosure in the ATM, and a picker mechanism may be provided for delivering the currency bills or notes that have been properly requested by a customer. The bills are delivered out of the secure enclosure through one of the openings <b>30</b> to a mechanism in the ATM which delivers the money to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Other openings in the front panel <b>28</b> are used in connection with a mechanism that receives deposits from customers. Customers may insert deposits through an opening in a fascia of the ATM, and a mechanism delivers the deposit envelopes through an opening in the front panel <b>28</b> to another mechanism within the chest portion. Generally the mechanism places the deposit envelopes in a secure removable container within the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The exemplary chest portion <b>12</b> further includes a hinge side panel <b>36</b> and a striker or lock side panel <b>38</b>. The hinge side and striker side panels extend generally parallel from front panel <b>28</b>. Striker side panel <b>38</b> includes a plurality of vertically aligned locking bolt apertures <b>46</b>. Locking bolt apertures <b>46</b> preferably extend through the striker side panel at a position that is somewhat disposed inwardly from a front surface <b>48</b> of the panel which bounds the opening <b>18</b>. Locking bolt apertures <b>46</b> are sized for accepting therein projections on a locking bolt in a manner later explained.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Chest portion <b>12</b> further includes a top panel <b>66</b>. Top panel <b>66</b> includes an opening <b>72</b> for providing access between the components within the secure enclosure and other components of the ATM of which the enclosure is a part. Opening <b>72</b> in panel <b>66</b> provides access for electronic cabling which communicates with the components inside the chest. Such cabling may be used to transmit signals from at least one processor that controls operation of the cash dispensing and depository mechanisms. In addition, wiring harnesses and other cabling provide connections to alarm devices and other equipment that are housed within the secure enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Chest portion <b>12</b> further includes a bottom panel <b>76</b>. Bottom panel <b>76</b> includes access openings <b>77</b> for purposes of providing connections to the items within the secure chest. In addition, bottom panel <b>76</b> may include plural foot mounting openings (e.g., four openings). Foot mounting openings can accept adjustable feet <b>88</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Adjustable feet <b>88</b> may be adjusted vertically for purposes of leveling and positioning the ATM of which the secure enclosure <b>10</b> is a part.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Exemplary chest door <b>14</b> also has a lock <b>34</b> mounted thereto. Lock <b>34</b> includes a lock bolt member <b>35</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Lock bolt member <b>35</b> is a member that is moveable between extended and retracted positions. Lock bolt member <b>35</b> extends from the case of lock <b>34</b> when the lock <b>34</b> is in the closed condition. Lock bolt member <b>35</b> is retracted into the case of lock <b>34</b> when the lock is in the open condition. The lock is operative to be opened from outside of the door <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An exemplary embodiment of a locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> includes a locking linkage arrangement. A drive cam <b>40</b> is connected to an idler cam <b>50</b> by a connector (e.g., cam link or lever or long link or L-Link) <b>52</b>. Further exemplary embodiments of cam links <b>134</b>, <b>196</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The curved portion of cam link <b>196</b> may be used to avoid contacting the cam link with other structure associated within the enclosure. The cam links may have a passage therethrough at each end. The drive cam may be driven by authorized personnel using a door handle located on the exterior of the door. It should be appreciated that the long link can be arranged to enable the idler cam <b>50</b> to rotate together in coordinated relation with the drive cam <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The drive cam <b>40</b> is connected to a locking bolt (e.g., lock bar) <b>60</b> by a link (e.g., bolt link or lever or upper short link or S-Link) <b>54</b>. Similarly, the idler cam <b>50</b> is connected to the elongated locking bolt <b>60</b> by a link (e.g., bolt link or lever or lower short link or S-Link) <b>56</b>. The bolt links <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are generally of the same length. Each of the bolt links <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> may also be used with either the drive cam or the idler cam. The short links, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are also generally shorter than the long cam link <b>52</b>. Further exemplary embodiments of bolt links are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>. The bolt links may have a passage therethrough at one end. A bolt link's passage is able to be aligned with a passage of the cam link for operative connection therewith. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a top view of a bolt link <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a side view of the bolt link <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also shows the bolt link <b>110</b> having an end portion <b>120</b>. The end portion <b>120</b> is typically shorter than an elongated portion <b>122</b> of the bolt link and also comprises a part which extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to the elongated portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-15</figref> are also side views of respective bolt links. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a bolt link <b>112</b> having a hook <b>114</b> at an end portion thereof to permit securement to a locking bolt <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a bolt link <b>116</b> having a pin <b>118</b> attached or integral thereto. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> are explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The exemplary locking bolt <b>60</b>, which is separately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, has openings or slots <b>62</b> to accept studs <b>32</b> therein. The studs may be directly attached to the door <b>14</b>, such as by welding. Each of the studs comprises a head and a narrower neck in an axial direction. The slots <b>62</b> have a wide or head portion enabling passage of a stud head therethrough, and a narrower or neck portion preventing passage of the stud head therethrough. The stud heads enable the locking bolt <b>60</b> to be secured to the studs. A stud, when the stud head is positioned overlaying a neck portion, prevents disengagement of the locking bolt therefrom in the axial direction of the stud. The studs are arranged and spaced in a manner to fully support the weight of the locking bolt <b>60</b>. Thus, the locking bolt <b>60</b> is able to be supported by and move relative to the door <b>14</b>. The openings <b>62</b> may be key shaped. The slots and studs are arranged so that after assembly of the locking bolt work mechanism the heads remain in the narrower portion during locking bolt movement. Thus, after assembly completion the locking bolt is prevented from disengagement with the door.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The studs may be fastened to the door in other fastening arrangements. For example, the studs may comprise shoulder bolts which extend into threaded bosses on the door <b>14</b>. The shoulder bolts can support the locking bolt <b>60</b> and enable the locking bolt to slide in supported relation thereon. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an arrangement using three studs <b>32</b> it should be understood that more or fewer studs may be used in other embodiments. Further, other arrangements may use a number of studs less than the number of slots in a locking bolt. This enables the same locking bolt to be used with different arrangements of studs, and hence different doors. Further arrangements may use locking bolt slots of different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The locking bolt <b>60</b> also has passages or openings <b>64</b> to receive an end portion of the bolt links <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. The end portion may comprise a finger, lip, hook, or tab (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an exemplary bolt link having an end portion <b>120</b> thereof to permit securement to a locking bolt <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an exemplary bolt link having a hook <b>114</b> at an end portion thereof to permit securement to a locking bolt <b>60</b>. The locking bolt openings <b>64</b> enable the bolt links <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> to be operatively engaged with the locking bolt <b>60</b>. When the locking bolt work mechanism is assembled on a door, the bolt link end portions extend far enough into the locking bolt openings <b>64</b> so that they are prevented from disengaging from the locking bolt. As explained later in more detail, a keeper or retainer can be used to retain a bolt link end portion in engagement with the locking bolt. Pivoting movement of the bolt links <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> relative to the locking bolt openings <b>64</b> results in sliding movement of the locking bolt <b>60</b> relative to the door.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The operation of the exemplary locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> is now explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The drive cam <b>40</b> includes a groove, slot, or cut out <b>42</b> in its outer periphery. Cut out <b>42</b> is sized for accepting a lock bolt member <b>35</b> therein when the lock bolt member is extended. As a result, when lock <b>34</b> is in a secure, closed condition and the lock bolt member <b>35</b> is extended into the cut out <b>42</b>, locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> is prevented from moving and is secured in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this position it should be noted that the locking bolt projections <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows five projections) are extended outwardly. When the door is closed, this enables the locking bolt projections <b>68</b> to be engaged in locking bolt apertures <b>46</b> in the striker side panel <b>38</b> of the chest portion.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the secure extended position of the locking bolt <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drive cam <b>40</b> and the idler cam <b>50</b> each have a front surface that is in abutting or close adjacent relation with a back surface of locking bolt <b>60</b>. This serves to resist movement of the locking bolt from its extended secure position. The abutting engagement can prevent movement of the locking bolt to the retracted position absent rotational movement of both of the drive cam and idler cam. The exemplary configurations of the drive cam and idler cam, which can include converging side walls which extend to the respective front surfaces, enable the cams to be positioned and moved in the manner shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">It should also be noted that in the secure position of the locking bolt <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bolt links <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> extend in an &#x201c;over center&#x201d; relation relative to their respective idler cams. This over center positioning of the bolt links provides that during initial rotational movement of either idler cam in a direction that would tend to retract the locking bolt <b>60</b>, the locking bolt actually moves slightly further outwardly rather than inwardly. As will be appreciated from the orientation of the components, a large rotational displacement of the idler cam <b>50</b>, as well as the drive cam <b>40</b>, is required before the locking bolt will retract a significant distance. This provides enhanced resistance to attack because limited movement of the cams or links will not enable significant movement of the locking bolt toward the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As previously discussed, the locking bolt <b>60</b> can be held in the secure position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the engagement of the lock bolt member <b>35</b> with the cut out <b>42</b> in drive cam <b>40</b>. When lock bolt member <b>35</b> is retracted, such as in responsive to an input or a lock dial receiving the correct combination, then the drive cam <b>40</b> is again free to be rotated. One or more handles may be arranged on the exterior of the door <b>14</b> to enable rotation of the drive cam. The drive cam <b>40</b> may be arranged such that a counterclockwise rotation of the drive cam moves the cam link <b>52</b> in an upward direction. This movement rotates idler cam <b>50</b> in a counterclockwise direction. The rotation of the cams moves the bolt links <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> to retract locking bolt <b>60</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The retraction of the locking bolt <b>60</b> causes the locking bolt projections <b>68</b> to move out of the locking apertures <b>46</b> in the striker side panel <b>38</b>. This enables the door <b>14</b> to be opened. Of course when it is desired to resecure the door, the door may be again moved to the closed position, such as by moving the drive cam in a clockwise direction. In this position the locking bolt <b>60</b> may again be extended such that projections <b>68</b> engage in the apertures <b>46</b> in the striker side panel, and the lock <b>34</b> may be changed such that lock bolt member <b>35</b> extends into the cut out <b>42</b> in the driving cam. This will again place the exemplary locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> in a secured or locked condition.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the exemplary locking bolt mechanism, because it provides multiple places (e.g., projections <b>68</b>) for engagement with an enclosure side panel, achieves more secure locking of the door in the closed position. In addition, the mounting of the locking bolt <b>60</b>, as well as the nature of the forces applied to move the locking bolt, enables the locking bolt to be moved easily when the lock has been opened. This enables the exemplary locking bolt to be rapidly changed from a secure condition to an open condition by authorized personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A further advantage of the locking bolt mechanism of the exemplary embodiment is that if one or more, or even all, of the bolt links are disconnected with the locking bolt in the extended position, the locking bolt cannot be moved to the retracted position. This is because the locking bolt engages the drive cam and/or the idler cam and is prevented from moving toward the retracted position until the drive cam and idler cams are properly rotated. This reduces vulnerability to a successful attack.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The assembly and arrangement of the exemplary locking bolt mechanism <b>24</b> will now be further discussed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a cut away top view of an (upper) end portion of the assembled locking bolt mechanism of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

For example, as previously mentioned, an assembly may include having a cam link intermediate of a cam and a bolt link.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In an exemplary embodiment the bolt work apparatus can be installed to a door using an efficient threaded fastener arrangements (e.g., two threaded bolts or studs and corresponding fastening nuts). Thus, the apparatus can provide for an efficient assembly, both in costs and time.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">An alternative exemplary embodiment of a locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows an exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b> includes a locking linkage arrangement different from that previously discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b> includes a drive linkage arrangement and an idler linkage arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows a locking bolt (e.g., lock bar) <b>220</b>. The locking bolt <b>220</b> may comprise a laser cut locking bolt.

The stepped bosses <b>240</b> include a neck portion <b>242</b> and a head portion <b>244</b>. The head <b>244</b> has a larger outer diameter than the outer diameter of the neck <b>242</b>. The elongated locking bolt <b>220</b> can have elongated openings or key holes <b>228</b>. The key holes include a wide head portion <b>236</b> and a narrow neck portion <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The bosses <b>240</b> can function to locate the locking bolt <b>220</b>. The wider portion <b>236</b> of a key hole <b>228</b> is able to slip over a stepped boss head <b>244</b>. However, the narrower portion <b>238</b> of the key hole prevents passage of the head <b>244</b> therethrough. Thus, the bosses can be moved (e.g., slipped or slid) into the narrower portion of the key holes to secure the locking bolt in an operating position. For example, the locking bolt can be secured with the boss heads outside of the narrower portion of the key holes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. The arrangement can eliminate the need of fasteners to secure the locking bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The locking bolt <b>220</b> can be arranged to hang from the uppermost (e.g., top) stepped boss. The top boss can be operative to correctly locate (e.g., guide) and align (e.g., position) the locking bolt. In an exemplary form of the apparatus, the top boss alone can support the locking bolt. The other stepped bosses can be used for security only, eliminating the need for machining. For example, the other stepped bosses can be directed to providing securing of the lock bolt <b>220</b> via the narrower key hole portions. The locking bolt can be used with little or no machining, especially regarding machining for alignment purposes. In other arrangements plural stepped bosses can be used to support the locking bolt <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The locking bolt <b>220</b> can also have a powder-coating (e.g., a powder-coat paint) applied thereto. The coating can be operative to reduce friction between mating parts. Thus, the need for (additional) lubrication such as grease can be eliminated. Additionally, the locking bolt <b>220</b> can be used for both front and rear load safes.</p>

A flat side can extend from one connector end to the other connector end along a common plane. The cam link may further have a wavy or curving configuration or shape (e.g., a W-shape or a C-shape with oppositely curved ends). The retainer can retain or keep the operative connection of the drive cam <b>202</b>, the bolt link <b>204</b>, and the cam link <b>206</b>. The retainer <b>208</b> can comprise a plate.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The drive bolt link <b>204</b> and an end (e.g., upper or top portion) of the cam link <b>206</b> can be secured to the drive cam <b>202</b> by using the drive retainer (or drive plate) <b>208</b>. The securing arrangement can be absent fasteners. That is, the drive cam, drive bolt link, cam link, and drive retainer connection can be arranged so that no additional fasteners are required. A connector comprising a shaft or pin <b>210</b> may be attached to, integral with, or one-piece with the retainer <b>208</b>. The shaft <b>210</b> can protrude through aligned holes in the bolt link <b>204</b> and the cam link <b>206</b>. The shaft <b>210</b> can also extend into an opening in the drive cam. The shaft can provide a pivot for the bolt link and the bolt. The shaft <b>210</b> connects the drive cam and the bolt link and the cam link. The assembly arrangement can secure the bolt link <b>204</b> and cam link <b>206</b> intermediate the drive cam <b>202</b> and the retainer <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A fastener (e.g., a nut) <b>212</b> can be used to secure the drive retainer and drive cam.

The bushing may be arranged in the bushing hole without being fastened to the lock bolt. The bushing can be retained in the hole by the securement of the drive retainer. However, alternative arrangements may include fastening the bushing to the lock bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The exemplary idler linkage arrangement includes an idler cam. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> also shows an idler cam <b>222</b>, a link <b>224</b> (e.g., idler link or bolt link or lever or short link or lower short link), and a retainer or keeper <b>226</b>. The keeper <b>226</b> can keep or retain operative connection of the idler cam <b>222</b>, the bolt link <b>224</b>, and the cam link <b>206</b>. The keeper <b>226</b> can comprise a plate. The idler bolt link <b>224</b> and an opposite end (e.g., lower or bottom portion) of the cam link <b>206</b> can be secured to the idler cam <b>222</b> by using the idler keeper (or idler plate) <b>226</b>. The securing arrangement can be absent fasteners. That is, the idler cam, idler bolt link, bolt, and idler keeper connection can be arranged so that no additional fasteners are required. A connector comprising a shaft or pin <b>230</b> may be attached to, integral with, or one-piece with the keeper <b>226</b>. The shaft <b>230</b> can protrude through aligned holes in the bolt link <b>224</b> and the cam link <b>206</b>. The shaft <b>230</b> can also extend into an opening in the idler cam. The shaft <b>230</b> can provide a pivot for the bolt link <b>224</b> and the cam link <b>206</b>. The shaft <b>230</b> connects the idler cam and the bolt link and the cam link. The assembly arrangement can secure the bolt link <b>224</b> and cam link <b>206</b> intermediate the idler cam <b>222</b> and the retainer <b>226</b>. The idler cam and the bolt link and the cam link are rotatable on the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A fastener (e.g., screw or shoulder screw) <b>232</b> can be used to secure the idler keeper and idler cam. The fastener <b>232</b> can secure the idler linkage arrangement to the door <b>216</b>. The fastener <b>232</b> arrangement can provide a pivot for the idler cam and idler plate.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A bushing <b>234</b> can be fastened to the bolt link <b>224</b>. Alternative arrangements may include providing the bolt link <b>224</b> with an integral (or one-piece) bushing end portion. The bushing <b>234</b> can be inserted into a hole (e.g., laser cut hole or opening) in the lock bolt <b>220</b>. The bushing <b>234</b> may be arranged in the bushing hole without being fastened to the lock bolt. The bushing <b>234</b> can be retained in the hole by the securement of the idler plate. However, alternative arrangements may include fastening the bushing to the lock bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In an exemplary form of the locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b>, the bolt links <b>204</b>, <b>224</b> can be identical. Also, the bushings <b>218</b>, <b>234</b> may be identical. Furthermore, the pins <b>210</b>, <b>230</b> may be identical. Of course other arrangements may use dissimilar links, bushings, and pins.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b> allows for the use of fewer fasteners (e.g., screws), fewer or no washers, a laser cut locking bolt, a flat laser cut cam link, laser cut cams, and laser cut holes. Thus, the locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b> can result in a reduced part count, a reduction in (or elimination of) machining, and easier assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> shows an exemplary door handle assembly <b>250</b> (e.g., bolt work handle arrangement). The handle assembly includes a sleeve <b>252</b> operative to locate and hold a handle <b>254</b>. The sleeve can be attached to the door <b>256</b>. The sleeve can have a tapered hole or inner surface <b>258</b> along its axis (e.g., through its center or middle portion). The tapered inner surface can receive or accept a tapered outer surface <b>264</b> of a handle shaft <b>260</b>. The sleeve and handle shaft can share a common axis extending through a hole of the door <b>256</b>. A handle lever <b>262</b> may be attached to, integral with, or one-piece with the handle shaft <b>260</b>. The handle lever <b>262</b> is shown located on the outside of the door <b>256</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> shows a separate view of the sleeve <b>252</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows a separate view of the door <b>256</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> shows a separate view of the handle <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The sleeve can have non-tapered ends which correspond to non-tapered portions on the shaft to provide for alignment of the handle relative to the door. That is, the shaft can have a tapered outer section intermediate a first constant outer diameter surface section <b>266</b> and a second constant outer diameter surface section <b>268</b>. Likewise, the sleeve can have a tapered inner surface section intermediate a first constant inner diameter surface section <b>270</b> and a second constant inner diameter surface section <b>272</b>. The first constant outer diameter surface section can match the first constant inner diameter surface section, and the second constant outer diameter surface section can match the second constant inner diameter surface section. Thus, matching surfaces can achieve alignment of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The sleeve and the shaft may have angled tapers resulting in engagement over the entire length of the tapered surfaces. The tapered surfaces may also have engaging teeth. The sleeve can be secured to the door, such as by welding or expanding. The sleeve can also have a step or ledge <b>274</b> to prevent its passage through (i.e., out of) the door hole, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The sleeve ledge can extend radially and circumferentially. The sleeve ledge may also comprise a circumferential series of separated radial projections. The shaft may be forced into the sleeve to prevent its removal therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The exemplary door handle assembly <b>250</b> provides additional security. For example, if the handle is broken off from the door through its shaft, then the remaining portion of the shaft cannot be forced (e.g., pushed) inwardly through the door. Rather, the two tapered surfaces would be pressed tighter together, preventing the shaft from being pushed through the door. Since the handle (e.g., via the handle shaft) cannot be forced through the sleeve, the locking mechanisms inside the safe would not be able to be disengaged. The safe may be that of an automated banking machine.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The door handle assembly <b>250</b> may be used in the locking bolt work apparatus <b>200</b>. The door can correspond to the door <b>216</b>. The handle shaft <b>260</b> may comprise the door handle portion <b>214</b>. The shaft <b>260</b> may have a threaded portion operative to receive a fastener <b>212</b> such as a threaded nut.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The door handle assembly <b>250</b>, with the relationship of the handle and sleeve as discussed herein, can add a new level of security to a safe.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In an alternative exemplary embodiment a locking bolt work apparatus can be used with a door having a shape other than rectangular. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> shows an automated banking machine <b>276</b> having a secure enclosure <b>277</b> comprising a safe or chest portion <b>278</b> with a moveable door portion <b>280</b>. The chest portion <b>278</b> comprises a generally L-shaped (or stepped) configuration when taken in cross section. The door portion <b>280</b> is sized for closing a generally L-shaped (or stepped) opening to the chest <b>278</b>. Thus, the chest door <b>280</b> likewise comprises a generally L-shaped (or stepped) configuration or contour when taken in cross section. As discussed in more detail hereinafter, a locking bolt structure can be provided to secure the door <b>280</b> to the chest <b>278</b>. Moreover, the securement can be provided at different portions or levels along the L-shape. Thus, a locking bolt work apparatus of the invention can add a new level of security to a non-conventionally shaped safe.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the chest door <b>280</b> can be removably attached to the chest enclosure <b>278</b> by (upper and lower) hinge assemblies <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>. The chest door <b>280</b> is movably mounted to the chest <b>278</b>. The chest door <b>280</b> can have mounted thereon a lock apparatus <b>286</b> and a door handle <b>287</b>. The chest door <b>280</b> is shown in a closed position or condition. The chest <b>278</b> is part of the automated banking machine <b>276</b>, such as an ATM or similar apparatus. The automated banking machine <b>276</b> also includes a service door <b>288</b>, shown in an open position. The service door <b>288</b> can include a window <b>290</b>. The window <b>290</b> may be used to view a display device, such as a service monitor <b>292</b> located within the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">It should be understood that different exemplary embodiments can include various L-shape chests. For example, a chest shape may be extended or reduced in either the vertical or horizontal direction of the L. Thus, an L-shaped chest can comprise a non-rectangular chest having six distinct side surfaces when taken in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The L-shape of the chest <b>278</b> enables an automated banking machine to use various arrangements. For example, the upper portion (or leg or vertical or raised portion) of the chest can be placed adjacent to the machine fascia. Thus, the machine can have an arrangement in which cash can be dispensed to a user through corresponding openings in the chest and fascia. Alternatively, the shape of the chest machine <b>278</b> can enable a machine to have additional interior space. For example, the lower top surface (or foot or horizontal portion) of the chest can be used to support additional or larger machine components and equipment. Furthermore, the stepped shape of the chest <b>278</b> enables usage (and support) of a stepped shaped component.</p>

The locking bolt can be substantially flat on at least one side to facilitate mounting. The door can support the locking bolt via door studs received in locking bolt slots. The locking bolt <b>302</b> can be attached to the enclosure door <b>280</b> so that it is operative to slidably move between an extended position and a retracted position relative to the door. Thus, the locking bolt can selectively secure the door in a position closing the enclosure chest. Other locking bolt work apparatus components can be respectively connected together with fasteners, as discussed in more detail hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> shows an exploded view of the locking bolt work apparatus <b>300</b>.

The lock bolt <b>302</b> has projections or teeth <b>304</b>. When the chest door is closed, the locking bolt projections <b>304</b> are operative to be moved into locking engagement with a portion of the chest. The locking operation of the locking bolt <b>302</b> is similar to the previously discussed locking bolt operation embodiments. For example, the locking bolt <b>302</b> can be extended such that the projections <b>304</b> engage in respective apertures in a striker side panel or wall of the chest during securing of the chest door <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The shape of the locking bolt <b>302</b> substantially corresponds to the side of the chest door <b>280</b> that will be located adjacent to the striker side panel of the chest <b>278</b> during door closure.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, linkage components of the locking bolt work apparatus <b>300</b> include a drive cam <b>306</b>, idler cam <b>308</b>, and cam link <b>310</b>. A drive bolt link <b>312</b>, idler bolt link <b>314</b>, and handle assembly <b>316</b> are also shown. In a manner previously discussed, the handle assembly <b>316</b> can be used to actuate the drive cam <b>306</b> to cause movement of the locking bolt <b>302</b>. The handle assembly <b>316</b> may be of the type previously discussed. Conventional handle assembly types may also be applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Other linkage components of the locking bolt work apparatus <b>300</b> include a drive keeper <b>318</b> (or retainer or linkage holding plate), an idler keeper <b>320</b> (or retainer or linkage holding plate), and various fastener arrangements. For example, an exemplary fastener arrangement can include a washer <b>321</b>, nut <b>322</b>, pivot pin <b>324</b>, screw <b>326</b>, and/or a shoulder screw <b>328</b>. Also shown is a door weldment <b>330</b>, sleeve <b>331</b>, sleeve <b>332</b>, relock pin <b>334</b>, helical coil spring <b>336</b>, relock cover <b>338</b>, machine screw <b>340</b>, relock cover plate <b>342</b>, self tapping pan head screw <b>344</b>, hex nut <b>346</b>, pan screw <b>348</b>, identification label <b>350</b>, and locking bolt slots <b>352</b>. Each slot <b>352</b> is operative to receive a respective door stud <b>354</b> during mounting of the lock bolt to the door <b>280</b>. The linkage and/or fastener components can function in the self-explanatory manner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, and as previously discussed. It should be understood that other known linkage or fastener components, types, arrangements, and/or combinations may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> the locking bolt is of integral or one-piece construction (i.e., a one-piece body). The locking bolt includes a first locking portion or body (e.g., <b>356</b>) that extends in a first direction. The locking bolt also includes a second locking portion or body (e.g., <b>358</b>) that extends in a second direction. The locking bolt also includes an intermediate arm portion <b>360</b>. The locking body portions <b>356</b>, <b>358</b> are connected by the arm portion <b>360</b>. The locking body portions <b>356</b>, <b>358</b> each include at least one locking projection or latch tooth <b>304</b>. Furthermore, the second direction is both generally parallel to and generally opposite the first direction. The second locking portion is also spaced from the first locking portion in a third direction. The third direction is generally perpendicular to the first and second directions.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the first direction is upward, the second direction is downward, and the third direction is relatively horizontal. Of course it should be understood that these direction descriptions are applicable to the shown exemplary arrangement, and that the door and locking bolt may be rotated and used in other arrangements and positions. For example, in another possible arrangement the third direction may be vertically upward, with locking projections moved upward to provide a locking condition.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the locking projections <b>304</b> extend generally parallel to the third direction. The first and second locking body portions <b>356</b>, <b>358</b> each comprise a set of substantially aligned latch teeth or locking projections <b>304</b>. For example, the projections <b>304</b> in the second body portion <b>358</b> are aligned in the second direction. The outermost edges of the locking projections in the second locking portion are also aligned with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The locking projections <b>304</b> extend away from their respective locking body portion <b>356</b>, <b>358</b>. The projections can extend in substantially the same direction for substantially the same distance. In an exemplary embodiment, all of the projections are identical in dimension. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> the lower body portion <b>358</b> extends a greater distance in the second direction than the upper body portion <b>356</b> extends in the first direction, and the lower body portion <b>358</b> also comprises more projections than the upper body portion <b>356</b>. However, it should be understood that in some embodiments a locking bolt may have an upper locking body portion comprising more projections.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Each locking body portion <b>356</b>, <b>358</b> can comprise at least one elongated slot <b>352</b>. As previously discussed, locking bolt slots <b>352</b> are each operative to receive a door stud <b>354</b> for use in mounting the locking bolt <b>302</b> relative to the door <b>280</b>. The slots can extend in substantially the same direction and be spaced in coordinated relationship with the door stud spacings. The slots <b>352</b> can be key-shaped and comprise a key hole, with a head portion and a narrower neck portion, as previously discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As previously discussed, in an exemplary embodiment, a locking bolt can be used with a door that has a generally L-shaped (or stepped) configuration or contour when taken in cross section. The door configuration can include an edge portion contour having at least three contiguous distinct edges. The locking bolt can have a stepped configuration when taken in cross section. The locking bolt contour may generally follow (or correspond to or match or align) with a portion of the door contour. For example, the locking bolt contour may substantially match the door edge portion contour. The stepped edge configuration of the locking bolt can provide stepped engagement areas in securing an L-shaped door. This arrangement enables the outermost edges of the locking projections to be substantially aligned with edges of the door. Thus, the projections only need to be moved a short distance outwardly away from the door edges in order to secure the door. This arrangement also enables the sets of projections to be nonaligned yet generally parallel with each other. That is, the alignment of a first set of projections can be perpendicularly offset from the alignment of a second set of projections. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the aligned row of projections in the projection set of body portion <b>356</b> are not in alignment with the aligned row of projections in the projection set of body portion <b>358</b>, yet each of the aligned rows (and sets) are generally parallel with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">It should be understood that other locking bolt configurations may be used. In other exemplary embodiments a locking bolt can be configured to match an irregular shaped door. For example, a door may have an angled or slanted step instead of a perpendicular step. Therefore, aligned rows of projections may be nonparallel with each other to match the door's slant. Likewise, the arm portion may be non-perpendicular relative to the body portions, e.g., the arm portion may be at a different angle or curved. Still, other locking bolt shapes can be used to correspond to the shape of a door edge. For further example, a locking bolt may have an S-shape to match an S-shaped door edge. Therefore, the projections in a body portion need not be aligned in a row but may curve to follow a curved door edge contour. The shape of a locking bolt of the invention can be made to substantially correspond to the shape of a door edge that will be located adjacent to a striker side panel of a chest. In other arrangements the teeth may project at an angle (e.g., 45 degrees) relative to the body portion, with the drive moving the locking bolt in that angled direction (e.g., 45 degrees) relative to the door. Thus, teeth set at 45 degrees would be moved into corresponding apertures set at 45 degrees in a striker side panel. Furthermore, it should be understood that more than two body portions and plural connecting arm portions may be used in additional locking bolt arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In operation of the exemplary locking bolt work apparatus <b>300</b>, the drive cam <b>306</b> can be rotated in a first direction to enable (via linkage) the locking bolt <b>302</b> to be moved to an extended or locking position. The handle assembly <b>316</b> may be used to rotate the drive cam <b>306</b>. With the chest door <b>280</b> closed and the locking bolt <b>302</b> extended, the locking bolt projections <b>304</b> protrude in apertures of the safe enclosure <b>278</b>. As previously discussed, the locking bolt can be held in the locking position by preventing rotation of the drive cam, such as by secured engagement with a drive cam cut out. Rotation of the drive cam <b>306</b> in a second or opposite direction enables the locking bolt <b>302</b> to be returned to a retracted or unlocked position, and enables the door <b>280</b> to be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">A useful aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the construction of a secure enclosure of an automated banking machine (e.g., ATM) is achieved through use of a hinge assembly which facilitates installation and adjustment of the door <b>280</b> relative to the chest portion <b>278</b>.

The hinge assembly <b>370</b> includes the hinge pin <b>380</b> extending into adjacent respective cavities <b>390</b>, <b>406</b> of the chest hinge portion <b>374</b> and the door hinge portion <b>376</b>. The use of hinge assemblies <b>370</b> of the exemplary embodiment, when mounting a door to an enclosure, enables the door to be selectively adjusted in up-down and right-left directions.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In an exemplary embodiment, the cavity <b>390</b> of the door hinge portion is a multi-diameter or stepped annular cavity. The cavity head or end portion <b>392</b> has a larger diameter than the intermediate portion <b>394</b> which in turn has a larger diameter than the threaded portion <b>396</b>. The end portion <b>392</b> and intermediate portion <b>394</b> are sized to receive the hinge pin <b>380</b>. The end portion <b>392</b> is also sized to receive the protective security sleeve or collar <b>378</b>. The threaded portion is bounded by the step <b>398</b>. The step <b>398</b> can be an annular radially extending step with an inner (or central) threading that corresponds to the threading of the set screw <b>400</b>. The up-down adjustment set screw <b>400</b> is rotated to move relative to the step <b>398</b> via the corresponding threads. In the exemplary embodiment the door hinge portion <b>376</b> is symmetrical, with the cavity portion on each side of the step <b>398</b> being the same size. Thus, the tipper <b>392</b> and lower <b>393</b> cavity end portions are the same size, with each operative to receive the plug <b>404</b>. As a result of the door hinge symmetry, the door hinge portion <b>376</b> is suitable for both right or left hand mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The up-down threaded adjusting member <b>400</b> is configured for threaded movable engagement with the threaded step <b>398</b> of the door hinge. As a result, the adjusting screw is movable axially in the cavity <b>390</b>. The adjusting screw <b>400</b> is movably adjustable in an up-down direction to enable the door <b>280</b> to be adjusted in an up-down direction. The up-down adjustment (or movable) member <b>400</b> may also be referred to as a (second direction) door alignment member. The door hinge portion <b>376</b> includes an up-down direction door alignment arrangement comprising the door alignment member <b>400</b> and the threaded step <b>398</b>. The recess <b>402</b> in the screw <b>400</b> corresponds to the size and shape of the upper ball bearing <b>386</b>. This relationship enables the upper ball bearing <b>386</b> to be engagingly received in the screw recess <b>402</b>. The upper ball bearing <b>386</b> can also provide a point for the door <b>280</b> to rotate about.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The plug <b>404</b> can serve to close the cavity <b>390</b> and is accepted in releasable engagement in the end portion <b>392</b>. The plug can assist in preventing debris from entering the cavity. The plug can also be used for security or cosmetic (i.e., appearance) purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The end portion <b>408</b> of the chest hinge portion cavity <b>406</b> has a larger diameter than the elongated bore portion <b>410</b>. The end portion <b>408</b> and bore <b>410</b> are sized to receive the hinge pin <b>380</b>. The end portion <b>408</b> is also sized to receive the protective security sleeve <b>378</b>. The size and shape of the bore recess <b>412</b> can correspond to or match that of the lower bearing ball <b>388</b>, enabling the ball to rest in the recess. The hinge pin <b>380</b> can be pivoted during right-left adjustment of the door <b>280</b>. The lower bearing ball <b>388</b> can provide a pivot point for the hinge pin <b>380</b>. Although only one bearing ball has been described to facilitate understanding of the bearing features, it should be understood that other exemplary embodiments using ball bearings comprising more than one bearing ball can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The right-left adjustment threaded set screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> are rotationally movable in the respective threaded passages <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> in the chest hinge portion <b>374</b>. A right-left adjustment of the door <b>280</b> can be accomplished by adjusting the position of the screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>. The screws are operative to engage the hinge pin <b>380</b> to cause pivoting (or tilting or rotating) of the hinge pin about the lower ball bearing <b>388</b>. This pivoting action can create an offset between the upper ball bearing <b>386</b> and the lower ball bearing <b>388</b>. This offset contributes to door adjustment in either a right or left direction relative to the chest. The adjusting screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> are located in the chest hinge portion <b>374</b> and can be individually adjusted so that alignment of the door in a right-left direction or orientation can be achieved and maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The bore <b>410</b> of the chest hinge portion <b>374</b> is adapted to receive or accept the hinge pin <b>380</b> therein. In an exemplary embodiment, the bore <b>410</b> is elongated right-left to permit pivoting movement of the hinge pin <b>380</b>. However, the bore is not elongated front-back. That is, the width of the chest hinge bore <b>410</b> in the front-back direction limits or prevents movement of the hinge pin <b>380</b> in the front-back direction. This arrangement enables the pin <b>380</b> to correspondingly move with movement of the screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>. The bore <b>410</b> can be tapered along the right-left direction to cause the right-left elongation. Alternatively, the right-left elongation may have a constant diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The adjusting screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> can be radially opposed and located on a common plane which contains a first bore diameter of the right-left elongation. This first bore diameter (along which the screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> are radially located) is larger than the bore diameter perpendicular thereto on the common plane. That is, at the common plane of the screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>, the right-left diameter (i.e., the first bore diameter) is wider than the front-back diameter (i.e., the perpendicular diameter).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> the hinge pin <b>380</b> (and thus the door hinge <b>376</b>) is shown as having been moved in a leftward direction with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>414</b> of the bore <b>410</b>. The symbol d represents the distance along the horizontal axis x that the upper bearing ball <b>386</b> is offset from the centered vertical axis y (i.e., longitudinal axis <b>414</b>). In this example, the distance d is representative of the distance that the door was moved in the right-left direction during alignment of the door with respect to the chest opening. In another example the pin <b>380</b> may be initially inserted as misaligned with the longitudinal axis <b>414</b>. Thus, in the another example the distance d may not be reflective of the actual distance that the door was moved, but the final axial offset position required to achieve door alignment in the right-left direction.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The protective security sleeve <b>378</b> can be used to prevent cutting of the hinge pin <b>380</b>. The protective security sleeve <b>378</b> can comprise a hardened collar that is sized for acceptance in both the cavity <b>390</b> of the door hinge as well as the cavity <b>406</b> of the chest hinge. The collar <b>378</b> is sized to be readily insertable over the hinge pin <b>380</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the diameter of the collar <b>378</b> is larger than the diameter of the bore <b>410</b> to prevent entry therein. The collar can be simultaneously positioned in both the door hinge lower cavity end portion <b>393</b> and the chest hinge cavity end portion <b>408</b>. In an exemplary embodiment the collar <b>378</b> is rotatably movable when installed. The ability of the collar to rotate further decreases the ability to cut therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In exemplary embodiments, the door adjustment features enable movement of a door in plural directions. As discussed herein, a door can be moved for alignment in substantially perpendicular directions (e.g., up-down and right-left directions).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">An exemplary installation and operation of the exemplary hinge assembly <b>370</b> will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. In an exemplary assembly process, plural identical hinge assemblies <b>370</b>, <b>372</b> are used to mount the door <b>280</b> to the enclosure <b>278</b> in alignment. Thus, only the installation of only one hinge assembly <b>370</b> needs to be described.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The cooperating hinge portions <b>374</b>, <b>376</b> of hinge assembly <b>370</b> can be attached in separate operations. That is, the chest hinge portion <b>374</b> is separately attached (e.g., via welding) to the chest <b>278</b> and the door hinge portion <b>376</b> is separately attached (e.g., via welding) to the door <b>280</b>. The lower bearing ball <b>388</b> is placed in the recess <b>412</b> of the bore <b>410</b>. The hinge pin <b>380</b> is inserted into the chest hinge bore <b>410</b> in supporting engagement with the bearing ball <b>388</b>. The protective sleeve <b>378</b> is placed around the pin <b>380</b> and comes to rest in the chest hinge cavity end portion <b>408</b>. The upper bearing ball <b>386</b> is placed in the hinge pin recess <b>382</b>. The door <b>280</b> (comprising plural hinge assemblies <b>370</b>, <b>372</b>) is then mounted onto the chest <b>278</b>. The door hinge portion(s) <b>376</b> are placed on respective hinge pin(s) <b>380</b>. Because of the welded attachments, the initial mounting may be somewhat misaligned. Returning to hinge assembly <b>370</b>, the mounting causes the up-down adjustment screw <b>400</b> to be engaged with the upper bearing ball <b>386</b>. An attempt can be made to close and lock the door. A determination (e.g., by service personnel) can then be made as to whether the door needs to be more accurately aligned with the chest opening. If necessary, the right-left door alignment members (e.g., set screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>) and the up-down door alignment member (e.g., set screw <b>400</b>) are accordingly adjusted by rotation thereof to achieve the desired door alignment. Thereafter, the cap <b>404</b> is placed on the door hinge portion <b>376</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the assembled condition of the exemplary hinge assembly, the collar <b>378</b> extends in the annular cavity end portions <b>393</b>, <b>408</b> in surrounding relation of the hinge pin <b>380</b>. The hinge pin extends upward into the door hinge <b>376</b> and downward into the chest hinge <b>374</b>. As previously discussed, the bore <b>410</b> is elongated in the right-left direction. Thus, the chest hinge bore <b>410</b> is configured to permit pivoting movement of the hinge pin <b>380</b> in the right-left direction. This configuration also enables the hinge pin to be accepted even though the hinge pin may be misaligned (i.e., not be perfectly co-axial) with the longitudinal axis <b>414</b> of the chest hinge bore. This construction enables the door <b>280</b> to be mounted on the chest <b>278</b> even though the hinge pins may be slightly misaligned.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In the assembled condition of the exemplary hinge assembly, the lower bearing ball <b>388</b> is securely held between the recesses <b>384</b>, <b>412</b>. The upper bearing ball <b>386</b> is securely held between the hinge pin recess <b>382</b> and the screw recess <b>402</b>. As can be appreciated, because the axial adjusting screw <b>400</b> is threaded in the threaded step <b>398</b> of the door hinge, it can be moved to adjust the relative vertical positions of the hinge components. This can be accomplished by inserting a tool through the upper access opening <b>392</b> of the door hinge cavity <b>390</b> to engage the up-down adjusting screw <b>400</b> (e.g., via a socket opening in the adjusting screw). This enables the door <b>280</b> to be selectively adjusted (e.g., in a vertically direction) so that its up-down alignment is fitted relative to the chest enclosure opening.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The right-left adjusting screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> can also be adjusted (e.g., in a horizontal direction) so that the door's right-left alignment can correspond to the chest enclosure opening. This can be accomplished by inserting a tool through (if necessary) respective threaded passages <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> to engage the right-left adjusting screws <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> (e.g., via a socket opening in each adjusting screw). The plug <b>404</b> can be removably placed into position in the door hinge cavity <b>390</b> to cover entry <b>392</b> thereof. The plug <b>404</b> can be installed after the up-down adjustment screw <b>400</b> has been appropriately positioned. As a result of proper door alignment, a locking bolt mechanism associated with the door can be properly operated to engage corresponding chest apertures to securely lock the door <b>280</b> to the chest <b>278</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">It should be understood that the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is exemplary and in other embodiments other arrangements may be used. Furthermore, the directional terms up-down (or vertical) and right-left (or horizontal) are merely examples of directional movement to facilitate understanding with regard to the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. The described novel door adjustment features are not limited to these directional terms nor any specific directional orientation. For example, the door adjustment features described herein are also applicable to chest doors arranged in other operating positions (e.g., a side door opening top to bottom (instead of from side to side); and a top door opening side to side). Furthermore, the door adjustment features described herein are also applicable to doors arranged in a variety of shapes (e.g., rectangular, non-rectangular, L-shaped, stepped, non-conventional). Thus, the scope of door adjustment features described herein encompass broad use with a wide range of door shapes and door orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">It will be appreciated that the hinge structure of the exemplary embodiment enables hinge portions to be initially assembled somewhat misaligned relative to one another due to minor inaccuracies in the assembly process or variations in materials. Despite the cavities and hinge pins of respective hinge portions not being co-axial, the hinge assembly construction still enables mounting of a door onto a secure chest enclosure. Thus, the hinges may still be assembled with the door movably mounted on the enclosure despite minor misalignment of the hinge components.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">It will also be appreciated that once a door is mounted on the chest (even with misalignment), the adjusting screws in the hinge assemblies can be appropriately positioned so as to align the door relative to the chest. This enables the door to be fit precisely with respect to the chest opening when the door is closed. It further enables the alignment of accepting apertures with locking projections. Thus, a door can be aligned to match an opening in an enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Furthermore, the hinge assembly construction of the exemplary embodiment enables the door to be removable in the open condition. Thus, there is no requirement to have the door permanently secured to the enclosure by the hinges. This is because when the door is in the closed position the action of the dead bolt projections and the dead bolt accepting apertures hold the hinge side of the door secured. This further facilitates the assembly process because it enables the chest hinge portions to be attached to the chest and the door hinge portions to be attached to the door in separate operations. During certain servicing procedures it may also be desirable to remove the door for purposes of accessing items in the interior area of the secure enclosure. The exemplary hinge assembly construction enables the door to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The exemplary hinge design and assembly method are also particularly useful when more than two hinges are used to attach a door to an enclosure. The hinge portions can be slightly misaligned both axially (e.g., vertically) and laterally (e.g., horizontally). Axial and lateral adjustments can be made to accurately position the door in aligned relationship with the enclosure. A wide variety of misaligned door orientations can be corrected. Thus, the exemplary hinge features permit an enclosure door to be readily attached (even with some misalignment) and accurately aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> shows an alternative automated banking machine <b>500</b>, such as an ATM or similar apparatus. The automated banking machine <b>500</b> may include any of the previously discussed locking bolt work arrangements. In an exemplary embodiment, the automated banking machine <b>500</b> includes a fascia <b>502</b> which serves as a user or customer interface. The machine further includes at least one output device, such as a display device <b>504</b>. The display device is operative to provide a user with a screen <b>506</b> that can comprise selectable options for operating the machine. The machine <b>500</b> can further include other types of output devices, such as a receipt printer <b>508</b>, a statement printer <b>510</b>, speakers, or any other type of device that is capable of outputting visual, audible, or other sensory perceptible information.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The automated banking machine <b>500</b> may also include a plurality of input devices <b>512</b>, such as an encrypting pin pad (EPP) <b>514</b> with keys <b>516</b>, function keys <b>518</b>, and a card reader <b>520</b> and bar code reader <b>522</b>. The card reader is operative to read data on user borne cards corresponding to financial accounts. These may include, for example, magnetic stripe cards, chip cards, contactless cards or other similar data bearing media. The machine <b>500</b> may further include or use other types of input devices, such as a touch screen, microphone, or any other device that is operative to provide the machine with inputs representative of user instructions or information. The machine may also include one or more biometric input devices such as a fingerprint scanner, an iris scanner, facial recognition device, hand scanner, or any other biometric reading device which may be used to read a biometric input that can be used to identify a user and/or permit a user to use the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The exemplary embodiment of the automated banking machine <b>500</b> may further include a plurality of transaction function devices <b>524</b> which may include, for example, a cash dispenser <b>526</b>, a depository mechanism <b>528</b> (which can include a cash acceptor, a check acceptor, a check imager, and/or an envelope depository), a cash recycler mechanism, or any other type of device which is operative to perform transaction functions involving transfers of value.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The exemplary embodiment of the automated banking machine <b>500</b> further includes a housing (the front side being shown) for housing the previously discussed transaction function devices, secure chest, and locking bolt work arrangement. For example, in and exemplary embodiment, an upper housing portion which is in supporting connection with the chest may house the display screen, card reader, and printer of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Alternative embodiments may include dead bolt portions that provide enhanced resistance to separation of the chest door from the chest through criminal activity. For example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> shows a lateral cross sectional view of a hinge side panel <b>540</b> of a secure chest of an automated banking machine. The cross sectional view shown would generally correspond to a horizontal cross section in the operative position of the machine. The hinge side panel <b>540</b> may be generally similar to the types previously discussed. A hinge side panel may include a plurality of vertically disposed apertures <b>542</b> in supporting connection therewith. It should be understood that in some embodiments each aperture may be an opening that extends in the hinge side panel while in other embodiments the aperture may be an opening or other structure that extends in structures that are in fixed attached engagement to the hinge side panel or other wall structures.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> an exemplary bolt portion <b>544</b> extends in the aperture <b>542</b> in the closed position of the door. Bolt portion <b>544</b> is in operative fixed engagement with the chest door. In some embodiments bolt portion <b>544</b> may be a unitary portion of the chest door. However, in other embodiments bolt portion <b>544</b> may be a separate structure that is operatively fixed to the chest door. In the exemplary embodiment the chest door is in fixed operative connection with a plurality of bolt portions <b>544</b>, and each bolt portion is operative to extend in a respective aperture <b>542</b> in the closed position of the door. Of course this approach is exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">It should be understood that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> the axis of rotation of the hinge is disposed in a direction outwardly of the aperture <b>542</b>. The outwardly direction is represented by an arrow <b>546</b>. As a result, unlocking the bolt work connected to the door adjacent the opposed lateral side of the chest enables the door to be moved from the closed position shown to an open position. In such movement the bolt portion <b>544</b> moves to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> and rotates in a counterclockwise direction. Likewise when the chest door is moved from the open position to the closed position, the bolt portion <b>544</b> moves clockwise and to the right as shown until it reaches the closed position of the door represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. Of course these approaches are exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The exemplary bolt portion <b>544</b> includes a first face portion <b>548</b>. First face portion <b>548</b> is tapered so as to provide a contour that resists the forceable separation of the chest door from the chest wall by deformation. In the exemplary embodiment first face portion <b>548</b> is tapered outwardly with increasing proximity to the outside of the chest portion on the side of the chest portion on which the hinge is located. The outside external surface of the chest portion is represented by surface <b>550</b> of panel <b>540</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. Of course it should be understood that this external surface is not necessarily the outside of the chest portion in some embodiments wherein structures overlie the outside of the side panel.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Bolt portion <b>544</b> further includes in lateral cross section a second face portion <b>552</b>. Second face portion <b>552</b> of the exemplary embodiment is disposed inwardly in a lateral direction relative to the first face portion <b>548</b>. Second face portion <b>552</b> is also tapered outwardly with increasing proximity to the side external surface <b>550</b> of the chest portion. Second face portion <b>552</b> is also disposed outwardly relative to face portion <b>548</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Extending in lateral cross section between exemplary face portions <b>548</b> and <b>552</b> is an outwardly extending bolt face <b>554</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the bolt face <b>554</b> extends outwardly and generally parallel of the center line of panel <b>540</b>. It should be understood that this approach is exemplary and other configurations may be used. An outwardly extending face <b>556</b> extends outwardly from the innermost portion of face portion <b>552</b> to the outside surface <b>558</b> of bolt portion <b>544</b>. It should be appreciated that this approach and configuration is exemplary and other embodiments may include different configurations and numbers of tapered face portions.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In the embodiment shown aperture <b>542</b> is bounded by an engaging surface <b>560</b> which is adapted to engage the bolt portion <b>544</b> in the event that an attempt is made to deform the secure chest and separate the chest door therefrom. As can be appreciated, if the hinge is cut by criminals and an effort is made to attempt to deform the chest door and/or chest walls to remove the chest door, the exemplary structure will provide beneficial resistance. As a result of such deformation the bolt portion <b>544</b> will generally be moved forward as shown in lateral cross section so as to engage the bolt portion with the engaging portion <b>560</b>. To help resist separation the exemplary embodiment of engaging surface <b>560</b> includes a face portion <b>562</b>. Face portion <b>562</b> is tapered in a manner similar to face portion <b>548</b> of the bolt portion. In the exemplary embodiment in the closed position of the door, the face portions <b>548</b> and <b>562</b> extend generally parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">A face portion <b>564</b> is similarly tapered and extends generally parallel in the closed position of the door with face portion <b>552</b>. An outwardly extending face portion <b>566</b> extends generally outwardly. Further in the exemplary embodiment in the closed position of the door, face portion <b>566</b> is parallel and generally linearly aligned with face portion <b>554</b> of the bolt portion <b>544</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">As can be appreciated if an attempt is made to access the interior area of the chest through deformation of the door, forward movement of the door causes bolt portion <b>544</b> to move forward. Such forward movement causes engagement of face portions <b>548</b> and <b>562</b> as well as face portions <b>552</b> and <b>564</b>. In the exemplary embodiment the contour of the face portions tends to hold the engaging surface and the bolt in engagement, thus resisting forces tending to pull the bolt portion out of the aperture. This makes it more difficult, and requires more force and deformation to separate the chest door and the chest.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">It should be understood that in some embodiments each of the bolt portions and apertures may include configurations so as to resist separation of the bolt portion and the chest wall. In other embodiments only certain bolt portions may have such features. Further it should be understood that the configuration shown is exemplary and other embodiments may include different configurations. Further, different bolt portions may include different surface configurations so as to resist relative movement of the door and chest portions in different directions. Further in still other embodiments desired contours may be included only on one surface while another surface may be generally planar or otherwise configured in a way that does not conform to the opposed adjacent surface. This may enable deformation of the planar surface during the attack by a relatively harder contoured surface, for example, so as to absorb the forces that deform the metal and further to enable such deformation to occur in a direction that best resists the forces that are being applied in the attack. Of course these approaches are exemplary and other approaches may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows in lateral cross section an alternative configuration of a locking bolt portion that may be used in connection with secure chest portions of cash dispensing automated banking machines. In this exemplary embodiment the chest portion includes a hinge side panel <b>568</b>. A hinge side panel may alternatively be referred to herein as a chest wall. The hinge side panel includes therein a plurality of vertically spaced apertures <b>570</b> generally like the embodiments previously discussed. In the embodiment shown the axis of rotation of the hinge is disposed in a direction outwardly which is represented by arrow <b>572</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Panel <b>548</b> is in fixed connection with a projection <b>574</b>. Projection <b>574</b> extends in a laterally inward direction from the inner face of the panel <b>568</b> as shown.</p>

Bolt portion <b>578</b> extends in aperture <b>570</b> in the closed position of the chest door. Of course when the chest door is opened in the normal manner, bolt portion <b>578</b> moves to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> and rotates generally counterclockwise out of the aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In this exemplary embodiment a further bolt portion <b>580</b> is in operative fixed connection with door portion <b>576</b>.
