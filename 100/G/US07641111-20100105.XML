<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for providing increased security for users of electronic equipment, such as, for example, mobile wireless communications devices, that include embedded circuits for enabling use with contactless payment systems. In particular, the disclosure is directed to methods and apparatus for providing authentication capability for devices that include contactless payment functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Contactless payment systems are gaining widespread acceptance by retailers and are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. In contactless payment systems, also known as &#x201c;Tap-and-Go&#x201d; or &#x201c;Pay and Wave&#x201d; payment systems, consumers use a payment card or other device that is equipped with an integrated chip and antenna that securely communicates consumer account information via a radio frequency communication link to a retailer's payment terminal. The payment terminal then connects to an appropriate financial network or other back-end processing system via, for example, a communication network, to authorize the transaction. Once authorized, the consumer completes the transaction. This scheme of contactless payment accomplishes a transaction in a fraction of the time required by cash, traditional credit cards or debit card transactions, which require a card to be swiped through a reader.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Contactless payment devices typically include a chip and antenna. The chip includes, for example, consumer account information. When the chip is brought into close enough proximity to a suitable reader, the antenna will be activated and will transmit the consumer account information residing on the chip to the reader. Of course, to avoid errors and ensure that the reader is communicating with the correct device, the proximity of the contactless payment device to the reader required to activate the antenna is typically on the order of a very few inches at most.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The chip and antenna of known contactless payment systems may be incorporated into any of a number of form factors that are convenient for consumers. For example, these chips and antenna have been embedded into key fobs, contactless smart cards, and even cellular telephones. In the future, these chips and antenna may be incorporated into any of a variety of forms due to their small size. Because mobile wireless communications devices, such as, for example, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, mobile e-mail devices, and the like, are being carried by more and more consumers, inclusion of the contactless payment system chips and antenna in these devices is becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such contactless payment systems suffer from a serious disadvantage that may result in unauthorized use of the device and significant loss of money or credit. For example, if a contactless payment device is lost, there is no quick and reliable way to avoid unauthorized use of the contactless payment device before the issuer of the account associated with the device is contacted by the user and the system cancels use of that particular device. In particular, there is no known solution for ensuring that the user of the contactless payment device is authorized to make payment using the contactless payment device. Of course, one solution may be to have the user enter a personal identification number or other like code at the point of sale to ensure that the user is authorized to make payment using the contactless device. This may be accomplished, for example, via a keypad associated with a contactless payment device reader. However, this solution may be somewhat at odds with the advantages associated with the use of such contactless payment systems in which speed and ease of use are paramount. Entering identifying information would slow the transaction speed down, and would not result in any more convenience than that associated with swiping a conventional credit or debit card to read its magnetic stripe.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, what is needed is a transparent way to authenticate a user of a contactless payment device that maintains the speed and convenience of contactless payment, while maintaining an acceptable level of security to ensure that unauthorized use of the device is restricted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, we have now identified an efficient, accurate and easy to implement system and method for authenticating contactless payments that is user friendly and transparent to the overall contactless payment system, yet maintains the convenience and transaction speed that make such contactless payment systems advantageous and desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an exemplary embodiment, the contactless payment system chip may be integrated with the security system of the device into which it is integrated, such as, for example, a mobile wireless communications device. The mobile wireless communication device must have the ability to enable and/or disable use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment system chip. For example, the mobile wireless communication device may include password functionality that is typically used to enable use of the mobile wireless communications device for features other than contactless payment, such as, for example, locking the mobile wireless communication device keypad. If there is no password set for the mobile wireless communication device, then the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is always enabled for use. However, if the password of the mobile electronic communication device is set, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip may be disabled when the mobile wireless communication device is locked. If the mobile wireless communication device is in an unlocked condition, the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is enabled for use. In the situation where contactless payment is attempted, but the mobile wireless communication device is locked, the user may be prompted by any number of means, such as, for example, vibration, tone or message on a screen of the mobile wireless communication device, or an indication from the contactless payment reader, to enter the appropriate password to unlock the device and enable contactless payment. If the correct password is not entered for a predetermined number of attempts, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is disabled and the transaction is not completed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, where the user may prefer a very rigorous and highly secure solution, entry of the password of the device in which the contactless payment chip is integrated, such as, for example, a mobile wireless communication device, may be required whenever a contactless payment transaction is attempted, regardless of the locked or unlocked condition of the device in which the contactless payment chip is integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another advantageous embodiment, the user may be required to enter a password to enable use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip once every predetermined number of contactless payment transactions. For example, the device may be set to request entry of a password upon the occurrence of every tenth contactless payment transaction. The device keeps track of the number of contactless payment transactions. Upon detection of the tenth attempted transaction, the device will prompt the user for entry of the appropriate password. If the correct password is entered, the transaction is enabled, and the counter which keeps track of the number of attempted contactless payment transactions is reset to zero. If the correct password is not entered after a predetermined number of attempts, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is disabled. This exemplary embodiment reduces the amount of potential loss, while maintaining a relatively high level of convenience for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another exemplary embodiment, contactless payment functionality may be associated with a so-called &#x201c;smart card.&#x201d; In this example, the smart card may include a chip that provides contactless payment functionality. The smart card having contactless payment functionality may be inserted into a smart card reader that is in communication with, for example, a mobile wireless communication device via a wireless connection, such as, for example, a Bluetooth&#x2122; connection. Additionally, the smart card reader may be a portable reader that is wearable by the user via, for example, a lanyard, or the like. When the smart card reader containing the smart card (including contactless payment functionality) is brought in proximity of a contactless payment reader, use of the contactless payment functionality may be controlled by the mobile wireless communications device in a manner similar to that described above, by controlling the smart card reader via wireless connection between the smart card reader and the mobile wireless communication device. For example, the mobile wireless communication device may include password functionality that is typically used to enable use of the mobile wireless communications device for features other than contactless payment, such as, for example, locking the mobile wireless communication device keypad. If there is no password set for the mobile wireless communication device, then the contactless payment chip is always enabled for use. However, if the password of the mobile electronic communication device is set, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip may be disabled via the smart card reader when the mobile wireless communication device is locked. If the mobile wireless communication device is in an unlocked condition, the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is enabled for use by the smart card reader. In the situation where contactless payment is attempted, but the mobile wireless communication device is locked, the user may be prompted by any number of means, such as, for example, vibration, tone or message on a screen of the mobile wireless communication device, or an indication from the contactless payment reader, to enter the appropriate password to unlock the device via the smart card reader and enable contactless payment. If the correct password is not entered for a predetermined number of attempts, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is disabled and the transaction is not completed. It will be understood that other security schemes using the security features of the mobile wireless communication device may be used, and other uses of the password functionality, such as those described above in connection with different exemplary embodiments may be used.</p>

Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, the mobile device may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). As mentioned above, such devices are referred to generally herein as mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mobile device <b>500</b> includes a transceiver <b>511</b>, a microprocessor <b>538</b>, a display <b>522</b>, non-volatile memory <b>524</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>526</b>, auxiliary input/output (I/O) devices <b>528</b>, a serial port <b>530</b>, a keyboard <b>532</b>, a speaker <b>534</b>, a microphone <b>536</b>, a short-range wireless communications sub-system <b>540</b>, and may also include other device sub-systems <b>542</b>. The transceiver <b>511</b> preferably includes transmit and receive antennas <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, a receiver (Rx) <b>512</b>, a transmitter (Tx) <b>514</b>, one or more local oscillators (LOs) <b>513</b>, and a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>520</b>. Within the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>, the mobile device <b>500</b> includes a plurality of software modules <b>524</b>A-<b>524</b>N that can be executed by the microprocessor <b>538</b> (and/or the DSP <b>520</b>), including a voice communication module <b>524</b>A, a data communication module <b>524</b>B, and a plurality of other operational modules <b>524</b>N for carrying out a plurality of other functions. The mobile device <b>500</b> may also include a contactless payment chip <b>110</b> and associated antenna <b>130</b> that may optionally be operatively coupled to the microprocessor <b>538</b> of the mobile device <b>500</b> to provide contactless payment functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mobile device <b>500</b> is preferably a two-way communication device having voice and data communication capabilities. Thus, for example, the mobile device <b>500</b> may communicate over a voice network, such as any of the analog or digital cellular networks, and may also communicate over a data network. The voice and data networks are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the communication tower <b>519</b>. These voice and data networks may be separate communication networks using separate infrastructure, such as base stations, network controllers, etc., or they may be integrated into a single wireless network. References to the network <b>519</b> should therefore be interpreted as encompassing both a single voice and data network and separate networks.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The communication subsystem <b>511</b> is used to communicate with the network <b>519</b>. The DSP <b>520</b> is used to send and receive communication signals to and from the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>, and also exchange control information with the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>. If the voice and data communications occur at a single frequency, or closely-spaced set of frequencies, then a single LO <b>513</b> may be used in conjunction with the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>. Alternatively, if different frequencies are utilized for voice communications versus data communications or the mobile device <b>500</b> is enabled for communications on more than one network <b>519</b>, then a plurality of LOs <b>513</b> can be used to generate frequencies corresponding to those used in the network <b>519</b>. Although two antennas <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mobile device <b>500</b> could be used with a single antenna structure. Information, which includes both voice and data information, is communicated to and from the communication module <b>511</b> via a link between the DSP <b>520</b> and the microprocessor <b>538</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The detailed design of the communication subsystem <b>511</b>, such as frequency band, component selection, power level, etc., is dependent upon the communication network <b>519</b> in which the mobile device <b>500</b> is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device <b>500</b> intended to operate in a North American market may include a communication subsystem <b>511</b> designed to operate with the Mobitex or DataTAC mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, PCS, etc., whereas a mobile device <b>500</b> intended for use in Europe may be configured to operate with the GPRS data communication network and the GSM voice communication network. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the mobile device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Communication network access requirements for the mobile device <b>500</b> also vary depending upon the type of network <b>519</b>. For example, in the Mobitex and DataTAC data networks, mobile devices are registered on the network using a unique identification number associated with each device. In GPRS data networks, however, network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device <b>500</b>. A GPRS device typically requires a subscriber identity module (&#x201c;SIM&#x201d;), which is required in order to operate the mobile device <b>500</b> on a GPRS network. Local or non-network communication functions (if any) may be operable, without the SIM, but the mobile device <b>500</b> is unable to carry out functions involving communications over the network <b>519</b>, other than any legally required operations, such as &#x2018;911&#x2019; emergency calling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">After any required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the mobile device <b>500</b> is able to send and receive communication signals, preferably including both voice and data signals, over the network <b>519</b>. Signals received by the antenna <b>516</b> from the communication network <b>519</b> are routed to the receiver <b>512</b>, which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows more complex communication functions, such as digital demodulation and decoding, to be performed using the DSP <b>520</b>. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network <b>519</b> are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP <b>520</b> and are then provided to the transmitter <b>514</b> for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network <b>519</b> via the antenna <b>518</b>. Although a single transceiver <b>511</b> is shown for both voice and data communications, in alternative embodiments, the mobile device <b>500</b> may include multiple distinct transceivers, such as a first transceiver for transmitting and receiving voice signals, and a second transceiver for transmitting and receiving data signals, or a first transceiver configured to operate within a first frequency band, and a second transceiver configured to operate within a second frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to processing the communication signals, the DSP <b>520</b> also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gain levels applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>512</b> and transmitter <b>514</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>520</b>. Other transceiver control algorithms could also be implemented in the DSP <b>520</b> in order to provide more sophisticated control of the transceiver <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The microprocessor <b>538</b> preferably manages and controls the overall operation of the mobile device <b>500</b>. Many types of microprocessors or microcontrollers could be used here, or, alternatively, a single DSP <b>520</b> could be used to carry out the functions of the microprocessor <b>538</b>. Low-level communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through the DSP <b>520</b> in the transceiver <b>511</b>. High-level communication applications, including the voice communication application <b>524</b>A, and the data communication application <b>524</b>B are stored in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> for execution by the microprocessor <b>538</b>. For example, the voice communication module <b>524</b>A may provide a high-level user interface operable to transmit and receive voice calls between the mobile device <b>500</b> and a plurality of other voice devices via the network <b>519</b>. Similarly, the data communication module <b>524</b>B may provide a high-level user interface operable for sending and receiving data, such as e-mail messages, files, organizer information, short text messages, etc., between the mobile device <b>500</b> and a plurality of other data devices via the network <b>519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The microprocessor <b>538</b> also interacts with other device subsystems, such as the display <b>522</b>, RAM <b>526</b>, auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, serial port <b>530</b>, keyboard <b>532</b>, speaker <b>534</b>, microphone <b>536</b>, a short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b> and any other device subsystems generally designated as <b>542</b>. For example, the modules <b>524</b>A-N are executed by the microprocessor <b>538</b> and may provide a high-level interface between a user of the mobile device and the mobile device. This interface typically includes a graphical component provided through the display <b>522</b>, and an input/output component provided through the auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, keyboard <b>532</b>, speaker <b>534</b>, or microphone <b>536</b>. Additionally, the microprocessor <b>538</b> is capable of running a variety of applications that may be present in the device non-volatile memory <b>524</b>, including applications that have access to various privileges, as will be described in more detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some of the subsystems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide &#x201c;resident&#x201d; or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard <b>532</b> and display <b>522</b> may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a data communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list or other PDA type functions. Another example of an application that may be controlled by the microprocessor <b>538</b> of the mobile device <b>500</b> is the password protection of the device <b>500</b>, wherein operation of the device or keyboard may be made dependent upon the locking or unlocking of the device <b>500</b> using, for example, a password entered via the keyboard <b>532</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Operating system software used by the microprocessor <b>538</b> is preferably stored in a persistent store such as the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>. In addition to the operating system and communication modules <b>524</b>A-N, the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may include a file system for storing data. The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may also include data stores for owner information and owner control information. The operating system, specific device applications or modules, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as RAM <b>526</b> for faster operation. Moreover, received communication signals may also be temporarily stored to RAM <b>526</b>, before permanently writing them to a file system located in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>. The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may be implemented, for example, with Flash memory, non-volatile RAM, or battery backed-up RAM.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An exemplary application module <b>524</b>N that may be loaded onto the mobile device <b>500</b> is a PIM application providing PDA functionality, such as calendar events, appointments, and task items. This module <b>524</b>N may also interact with the voice communication module <b>524</b>A for managing phone calls, voice mails, etc., and may also interact with the data communication module <b>524</b>B for managing e-mail communications and other data transmissions. Alternatively, all of the functionality of the voice communication module <b>524</b>A and the data communication module <b>524</b>B may be integrated into the PIM module.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> preferably provides a file system to facilitate storage of PIM data items on the device. The PIM application preferably includes the ability to send and receive data items, either by itself, or in conjunction with the voice and data communication modules <b>524</b>A, <b>524</b>B, via the wireless network <b>519</b>. The PIM data items are preferably seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated, via the wireless network <b>519</b>, with a corresponding set of data items stored or associated with a host computer system, thereby creating a mirrored system for data items associated with a particular user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The mobile device <b>500</b> is manually synchronized with a host system by placing the mobile device <b>500</b> in an interface cradle, which couples the serial port <b>530</b> of the mobile device <b>500</b> to a serial port of the host system. The serial port <b>530</b> may also be used to insert owner information and owner control information onto the mobile device <b>500</b> and to download other application modules <b>524</b>N for installation on the mobile device <b>500</b>. This wired download path may further be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device <b>500</b> for use in secure communications, which is a more secure method than exchanging encryption information via the wireless network <b>519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Owner information, owner control information and additional application modules <b>524</b>N may be loaded onto the mobile device <b>500</b> through the network <b>519</b>, through an auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>528</b>, through the short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b>, or through any other suitable subsystem <b>542</b>, and installed by a user in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> or RAM <b>526</b>. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device <b>500</b> and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the mobile device <b>500</b> is operating in a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or a web page download, will be processed by the transceiver <b>511</b> and provided to the microprocessor <b>538</b>, which preferably further processes the received signal for output to the display <b>522</b>, or, alternatively, to an auxiliary I/O device <b>528</b>. Owner information, owner control information, commands or requests related to owner information or owner control information, and software applications received by the transceiver <b>511</b> are processed as described above. A user of mobile device <b>500</b> may also compose data items, such as email messages, using the keyboard <b>532</b>, which is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard laid out in the QWERTY style, although other styles of complete alphanumeric keyboards such as the known DVORAK style may also be used. User input to the mobile device <b>500</b> is further enhanced with the plurality of auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, which may include a thumbwheel input device, a touchpad, a variety of switches, a rocker input switch, etc. The composed data items input by the user are then transmitted over the communication network <b>519</b> via the transceiver <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the mobile device <b>500</b> is operating in a voice communication mode, the overall operation of the mobile device <b>500</b> is substantially similar to the data mode, except that received signals are output to the speaker <b>534</b> and voice signals for transmission are generated by a microphone <b>536</b>. In addition, the secure messaging techniques described above might not necessarily be applied to voice communications. Alternative voice or audio I/O devices, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device <b>500</b>. Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished through the speaker <b>534</b>, the display <b>522</b> may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. For example, the microprocessor <b>538</b>, in conjunction with the voice communication module <b>524</b>A and the operating system software, may detect the caller identification information of an incoming voice call and display it on the display <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b> is also be included in the mobile device <b>500</b>. For example, the subsystem <b>540</b> may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth or 802.11 short-range wireless communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices. Thus, owner information insertion, owner control information insertion, and application loading operations as described above may be enabled on the mobile device <b>500</b> via the serial port <b>530</b> or other short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The exemplary mobile device <b>500</b> described herein may also include an embedded or integrated contactless payment chip <b>110</b> and antenna <b>130</b>, such as that described above. As such, the mobile device <b>500</b> is provided with optional contactless payment functionality that may include a degree of password protection as will be illustratively described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a specific example of an electronic device in which contactless payment systems and methods described herein may be implemented. Implementation of such systems and methods in other electronic devices having further, fewer, or different components than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> would occur to one skilled in the art to which this application pertains and are therefore considered to be within the scope of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of contactless payment authentication according to an exemplary embodiment. In this example, upon detection of an attempted use of a contactless payment chip <b>300</b> that is, for example, embedded in a mobile wireless communication device <b>500</b>, an inquiry is made to determine whether the device <b>500</b> has authentication functionality, such as, for example, password protection functionality enabled <b>310</b>. Detection of an attempted use of the contactless payment chip may be determined in any number of ways, such as, for example, detection of activation of the antenna <b>130</b>. If, in step <b>310</b>, it is determined that there is no password protection, or that password protection features are not enabled, the device <b>500</b> enables use of the payment functionality of the embedded contactless payment chip <b>110</b> to complete the transaction <b>320</b>. On the other hand, if in step <b>310</b> it is determined that the device <b>500</b> has enabled password features, the device <b>500</b> determines whether the device is locked <b>330</b>. If the device is not locked, the device <b>500</b> enables use of the payment functionality of the embedded contactless payment chip <b>110</b> to complete the transaction <b>320</b>. If the device is locked, the user is prompted to enter the password <b>340</b> using, for example, the keyboard <b>532</b> of the device <b>500</b>. As described above, the user may be prompted by any number of methods, such as, for example, vibration of the device, emission of a tone by the device, display of a message on the device screen, a message on the contactless payment reader, etc. If the correct password is entered <b>350</b>, then the device <b>500</b> enables use of the payment functionality of the embedded contactless payment chip <b>110</b> to complete the transaction <b>320</b>. On the other hand, if the incorrect password is entered <b>350</b>, the device <b>500</b> disables use of the contactless payment functions <b>360</b>. Disabling use of the payment functionality of the chip <b>110</b> may be achieved by any number of acceptable means, such as, for example, and without limitation, disabling the antenna <b>130</b> so that transmission of payment related data from the chip to the payment terminal <b>140</b>, smart card reader <b>770</b>, or the like. Alternatively, a predetermined number of attempts to enter the correct password may be allowed to allow the user some flexibility and to avoid unnecessary denial of access.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this manner, a certain level of security is provided to the contactless payment functionality via the device <b>500</b>. This security level is not intrusive and can be set to any level desired by the user. For example, the user may desire no security whatsoever, in which case the user may set the device to not use password protection at all. Alternatively, the device may only be locked at certain times, and may be unlocked for long periods of time. Of course, the device may be locked upon the occurrence of any event, which would provide a very high, albeit somewhat intrusive, level of security. In any event, the level of security is determined based on a comfort level of the user. It will also be understood that the authentication functionality may be implemented in any suitable manner including, but not limited to, being implemented on a processor of the device or a by a server that may run various applications specific to the device or system.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, as illustrated in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a more intrusive, but highly secure method of contactless payment authentication is disclosed. According to this example, upon detection of attempted use of the embedded contactless payment functionality <b>400</b>, as described above, a determination is made as to whether the device <b>500</b> has authentication functionality, such as, for example, password functionality enabled <b>410</b>. If password functionality is not enabled or if the device does not have any password functionality, use of the contactless payment functionality is enabled <b>420</b>. If the device <b>500</b> does have password functionality that is enabled <b>410</b>, the user is prompted for the password <b>430</b>. As described above, the user may be prompted by any number of methods, such as, for example, vibration of the device, emission of a tone by the device, display of a message on the device screen, a message on the contactless payment reader, etc. After entry of the password <b>440</b>, it is determined whether the password is correct <b>450</b>. If the password entered by the user <b>440</b> is correct, use of the contactless payment functionality is enabled <b>420</b>. If the password entered by the user is incorrect, the use of contactless payment functionality is disabled <b>460</b>. As described above, the system may be designed to allow a predetermined number of password entry attempts prior to disabling the use of contactless payment functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The illustrative example set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the most secure, but is also the most intrusive and time consuming. However, for those who value security over convenience and time savings, the solution set forth in this example may be preferred. As set forth above, it will be understood that the authentication functionality may be implemented in any suitable manner including, but not limited to, being implemented on a processor of the device or a by a server that may run various applications specific to the device or system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another method of contactless payment authentication according to another exemplary embodiment is illustrated. According to this example, the device <b>500</b> is set to check for an authentication code, such as, for example, a password upon the detection of a predetermined number of contactless payment attempts. In this manner, a certain level of security is provided wherein limitless unauthorized use of the embedded contactless payment functionality is prevented, while minimizing the intrusiveness and inconvenience that may be associated with password verification of contactless payments. In this example, a counter that keeps track of the number of contactless payment attempts is first set to zero <b>600</b>. Each time a contactless payment attempt is detected <b>610</b> by the device <b>500</b>, the counter is incremented <b>620</b>. The counter is checked <b>630</b> each time a contactless payment is attempted <b>610</b>. So long as the counter is determined to be less than a predetermined number <b>630</b>, use of contactless payment functionality embedded in the device <b>500</b> is enabled <b>640</b>. If the counter is determined to be greater than or equal to the predetermined number of attempts <b>630</b>, the user is prompted to enter the password <b>650</b>. As described above, the user may be prompted by any number of methods, such as, for example, vibration of the device, emission of a tone by the device, display of a message on the device screen, a message on the contactless payment reader, etc. After entry of the password <b>660</b>, it is determined whether the password is correct <b>670</b>. If the password entered by the user <b>670</b> is correct, use of the contactless payment functionality is enabled <b>690</b> and the counter is reset to zero <b>600</b>. If the password entered by the user is incorrect, the use of contactless payment functionality is disabled <b>680</b>. As described above, the system may be designed to allow a predetermined number of password entry attempts prior to disabling the use of contactless payment functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this example, the user may have to supply their password once in every predetermined number of contactless payment attempts. Operating the contactless payment system according to this embodiment would reduce user interaction and inconvenience, while at the same time reducing the amount of unlawful or unauthorized usage. As described above, the system may be designed to allow a predetermined number of password entry attempts prior to disabling the use of contactless payment functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, contactless payment functionality may be associated with a so-called smart card <b>700</b>. In this example, the smart card <b>700</b> may include a chip <b>710</b> that provides contactless payment functionality via consumer account information <b>710</b> resident on the chip, and an antenna <b>730</b> that is used to transmit information to a contactless payment reader <b>740</b>. The smart card <b>700</b> having contactless payment functionality may be inserted into a smart card reader <b>770</b> that is in communication with, for example, a mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> via a wireless connection, such as, for example, a Bluetooth&#x2122; connection. Additionally, the smart card reader <b>770</b> may be a portable reader that is wearable by the user via, for example, a lanyard (not shown), or the like. When the smart card reader <b>770</b> containing the smart card (including contactless payment functionality) <b>700</b> is brought in proximity of a contactless payment reader <b>740</b>, use of the contactless payment functionality may be controlled by the mobile wireless communications device <b>780</b> in a manner similar to that described above, by controlling the smart card reader <b>770</b> via wireless connection between the smart card reader <b>770</b> and the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b>. As described above, when the contactless payment terminal <b>740</b> receives consumer account information <b>710</b> from the smart card <b>700</b> via the antenna <b>730</b>, this information is sent to a transaction processing system <b>760</b> over a communication network <b>750</b>. The transaction processing system <b>760</b> authenticates the consumer account information <b>710</b> and sends an indication to the contactless payment terminal <b>740</b>, via the communication network <b>750</b>, as to whether the transaction is authorized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As set forth above, security features of the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> may be used to control the transmission of consumer account information <b>710</b> when the smart card reader <b>770</b> is in proximity to the contactless payment terminal <b>740</b>. For example, the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> may include password functionality that is typically used to enable use of the mobile wireless communications device for features other than contactless payment, such as, for example, locking the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> keypad. If there is no password set for the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b>, then the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip is always enabled for use. However, if the password of the mobile electronic communication device <b>780</b> is set, use of the payment functionality of the contactless payment chip <b>710</b> may be disabled via the smart card reader <b>770</b> when the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> is locked. If the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> is in an unlocked condition, contactless payment functionality is enabled for use by the smart card reader <b>770</b>. In the situation where contactless payment is attempted, but the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b> is locked, the user may be prompted by any number of means, such as, for example, vibration, tone or message on a screen of the mobile wireless communication device <b>780</b>, or an indication from the contactless payment reader <b>740</b>, to enter the appropriate password to unlock the device via the smart card reader <b>770</b> and enable contactless payment. If the correct password is not entered for a predetermined number of attempts, the contactless payment functionality is disabled and the transaction is not completed. It will be understood that other security schemes using the security features of the mobile wireless communication device may be used, and other uses of the password functionality, such as those described above in connection with different exemplary embodiments may be used, such as, for example, those described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
