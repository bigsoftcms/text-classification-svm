<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a hinge assembly and, particularly, to a hinge assembly for a flat display monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the widespread use and the variety of computers available, display devices, configured for such a variety of computers also come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and weight. In general, a typical cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor includes a display panel for displaying an image, a vacuum tube coupled to the rear of the display panel, and an electron gun coupled to the rear of the vacuum tube. This configuration is a huge factor in limiting the total volume and final weight of the CRT monitor. In addition to the problem mentioned above, the CRT monitor carries a huge problem in that a user is easily fatigued when looking at the CRT monitor over long hours due to its low image quality. It is this problem alone that many people have recently switched into using a flat screen display monitor, e.g., Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitor, from the conventional CRT monitors. Such flat display monitors generally offer the advantages of a greatly reduced size and weight properties including the ability to produce a high image quality. Furthermore, flat screen display monitors may help to overcome space limitations through folding over (such as with a laptop computer) or rotating (such as with a desktop monitor) so as to facilitate adjustment of the position thereof relative to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rotating or folding-over functions of the flat display monitor are realized with a hinge assembly. For example, a hinge assembly is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2002/0083554. The hinge assemble includes an L-shaped fixed seat, a pivotal axle, and multiple oiled washers. The fixed seat has a retaining hole defined thereof. The pivotal axle is pivotally connected with the fixed seat. The pivotal axle has a retaining shoulder formed at a middle portion thereof, a connecting end portion integrally formed at a first end of the retaining shoulder, and a fixing end portion integrally formed at a second end of the retaining shoulder. The connecting end portion of the pivotal axle is extended through a retaining hole of the fixed seat along with multiple oiled washers, and then fastened by a fastening piece. The hinge assembly may realize a maximum inclination angle of the flat display monitor so that the LCD shall not over fold, over shifting a center of gravity, causing the LCD to fall over. However, in use, it is needed to use great efforts to rotate the hinge assembly, since a greater force is exerted thereon. Therefore, the flat display monitor is highly damaged prone. As a result, it is inconvenient for a user to operate the hinge assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a new hinge assembly is desired in order to overcome the above-described shortcomings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment thereof, a hinge assembly for use in a flat display monitor includes a base seat, a fixing seat, a resilient element, a pivotal shaft, and a plurality of washers. The base seat includes a pivot flange having a retaining hole formed therein. The pivot flange defines a protrusion therein, and the protrusion extending into the retaining hole. The fixing seat includes an extending portion defining an engaging hole. The resilient element resists between the base seat and the fixing seat. The pivotal shaft has at least one flat surface, and the pivotal shaft is positioned within the retaining hole of the pivot flange. One of the at least one flat surface pivotably engages with the protrusion. The pivotal shaft extends beyond the retaining hole of the pivot flange and non-rotatably engages in the engaging hole of the fixing seat. The plurality of washers is fastened together by the pivotal shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other advantages and novel features will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to drawings in detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a flat display monitor employing a hinge assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The flat display monitor is taken here as an exemplary application, for the purposes of describing details of the hinge assembly <b>300</b>. It is to be understood, however, that the hinge assembly <b>300</b> could be advantageously used in other environments (e.g. cabinet doors). As such, although proving particularly advantages when used in flat display monitors, the hinge assembly <b>300</b> should not be considered limited in scope solely to an intended use environment of flats display monitors. A hinge assembly <b>300</b> is illustrated in the flat display monitor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The flat display monitor includes a display unit <b>100</b> and a support body <b>200</b>. The hinge assembly <b>300</b> connects the display unit <b>100</b> to the support body <b>200</b> such that the display unit <b>100</b> can be pivoted relative to the support body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hinge assembly <b>300</b> includes a base seat <b>10</b>, a fixing seat <b>20</b>, two pivot sets consisting a pivotal shaft <b>30</b>, a triplet of first washers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>, a pair of resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, a pair of second washers <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, a screw nut <b>70</b>, and a resilient element <b>80</b>. The hinge assembly <b>300</b> uses the base seat <b>10</b> and the fixing seat <b>20</b> to connect the display unit <b>100</b> and the support body <b>200</b> respectively. The pivotal shaft <b>30</b> passes through the fixing seat <b>20</b>, the base seat <b>10</b> and multiple washers. The pivot shaft <b>30</b> is then fastened in its assembled position with the screw nut <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The base seat <b>10</b> is substantially a board, which includes a main board <b>11</b>. The main board <b>11</b> has several fixing holes <b>12</b> defined in the brim thereof. The base seat <b>10</b> may be fixed on the display unit <b>100</b> by means of the fixing holes <b>12</b>. The main board <b>11</b> disposes two symmetrical pivot flanges <b>14</b> at a middle portion thereof. Each pivot flange <b>14</b> is perpendicular to the main board <b>11</b>. The pivot flanges <b>14</b> are formed through cutting and bending. Each pivot flange <b>14</b> is substantially half-circular in shape, and has a retaining hole <b>16</b> defined therein. A protrusion <b>18</b> is formed extending inwards on an arc of the retaining hole <b>16</b>. The protrusion <b>18</b> has two symmetrical edges <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> and is substantially &#x3c;-shaped (i.e., a rotated V shape). A protrusion angle associated with the protrusion <b>18</b> establishes the rotational angle limits for the two pivot sets of hinge assembly <b>300</b> and, thus, for the display unit <b>100</b>. Each pivot flange <b>14</b> has a rectangular locking hole <b>19</b> defined adjacent to each side of the retaining hole <b>16</b>. The base seat <b>10</b> disposes resisting portions <b>17</b>, one at a side of each pivot flange <b>14</b>. The resisting portions <b>17</b> are disposed between the two pivot flanges <b>14</b> and are inclined to some angles relative to the main board <b>11</b>. The main board <b>11</b> has a projecting block <b>13</b> disposed between the pivot flange <b>14</b> and the resisting portion <b>17</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The fixing seat <b>20</b> includes a fixing board <b>22</b> and two pivot boards <b>26</b>. The fixing board <b>22</b> is made up of a horizontal board <b>220</b> and a perpendicular board <b>222</b> connected with each other. The horizontal board <b>220</b> has two receiving holes <b>24</b> defined therein. The fixing seat <b>20</b> is mounted on the support body <b>200</b> by means of the receiving holes <b>24</b>. Each pivot board <b>26</b> extends from opposite ends of the fixing board <b>20</b> adjacent to the perpendicular board <b>222</b>. The pivot boards <b>26</b> extend in a direction opposite to that of the perpendicular board <b>222</b>. Each pivot board <b>26</b> has a D-shaped engaging hole <b>27</b> defined thereof. Each pivot board <b>26</b> has a notch <b>28</b> defined thereof opposite to the perpendicular board <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pivotal shaft <b>30</b> is substantially cylindrical in shape. The pivotal shaft <b>30</b> includes a shaft portion <b>34</b> and a fixing portion <b>32</b> integrally formed at a distal end of the shaft portion <b>34</b>. The fixing portion <b>32</b> is substantially a disklike shape. The shaft portion <b>34</b> defines a thread <b>38</b> on a distal end portion thereof opposite to the fixing portion <b>32</b>. The shaft portion <b>34</b> is flattened along a section of the curved surface area forming a flat surface <b>36</b> making the thread <b>38</b> thereof non-continuous. The shaft portion <b>34</b> may pass through the engaging hole <b>27</b> of the fixing seat <b>20</b> and the retaining hole <b>16</b> of the base seat <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first washers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b> are each ringlike. Each of the first washers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b> has a latching end <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, and <b>430</b> disposed at one side of the brink respectively thereof. The latching end <b>410</b> of the first washer <b>410</b> is configured for inserting into the notch <b>28</b> of the fixing seat <b>20</b>, and the latching end <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> may be received in the locking holes <b>19</b> of the base seat <b>10</b>, thereby limiting the rotation of the first washers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>. Each of the first washers has a plurality of oil grooves <b>412</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>432</b> on the face opposite to the latching end. The oil grooves can be lubricated so that the operation of the hinge assembly <b>300</b> is smooth and the work life of the hinge assembly is prolonged.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are in essence Belleville washers. The two resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are passed through the pivotal shaft <b>30</b>. The resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may provides an amount of friction that helps the display unit <b>100</b> retain the desired positioning relative to the support body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second washers <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are ringlike shaped. Each of the second washers <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> has a latching hole <b>610</b> and <b>620</b> respectively defined therein. The latching holes <b>610</b> and <b>620</b> are D-shaped. A side of the second washers <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> has oil grooves <b>612</b> and <b>622</b> respectively defined thereon for saving lubricant oils.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The resilient element <b>80</b> is a helical spring. One end of the resilient element <b>80</b> is locked onto the base seat <b>10</b> between the resisting portion <b>17</b> and the projecting block <b>13</b>. Another end of the resilient element <b>80</b> resists the horizontal board <b>220</b> of the fixing seat <b>20</b>. When the hinge assembly <b>300</b> is assembled, the resilient element <b>80</b> exerts a predetermined torsion force. A diameter of the resilient element <b>80</b> is larger than that of the resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> and the second washers <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> so as to avoid interference each other. The screw nut <b>70</b> is fastened with the thread <b>38</b> of the shaft portion <b>34</b> of the pivotal shaft <b>30</b>. All of the washers, as a group, maintain the desired spacing between the various portions of the pivot of the hinge assembly <b>300</b>. Furthermore, the washers together help provide an amount of friction that allows movement of the display unit <b>100</b> relative to the support body <b>200</b> upon application of a moderate force but that, otherwise, helps retain the desired positioning between the support body <b>200</b> and the display unit <b>100</b>. Part of the needed friction can, be expected to be gained through the operation of the other elements of the hinge assembly <b>300</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During assembly, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, first, the latching end <b>410</b> of the first washer <b>40</b> is inserted into the notch <b>28</b> of the pivot board <b>26</b>. Then, the two first washers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are disposed separately on the two sides of the pivot flange <b>14</b> of the base seat <b>10</b>, with the latching ends <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> engaging in a corresponding locking hole <b>19</b> of the base seat <b>10</b>. After that, the resilient element <b>80</b> is placed around the shaft portion <b>34</b> of the pivotal shaft <b>30</b>. The resilient element <b>80</b> has a predetermined torque force. One end of the resilient element <b>80</b> is mounted onto the base seat <b>10</b> between the resisting portion <b>17</b> and the projecting block <b>13</b>, the other end of the resilient element resist the horizontal board <b>220</b> of the fixing seat <b>20</b>. Then, the shaft portion <b>34</b> of the pivotal shaft <b>30</b> passes through the engaging hole <b>27</b> of the fixing seat <b>20</b>, the first washers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, the retaining hole <b>16</b> of the base seat <b>10</b>, the first washer <b>43</b>, in that order. After that, the shaft portion <b>34</b> is passed through the resilient washer <b>51</b>, the second washer <b>61</b>, the resilient washer <b>52</b>, and the second washer <b>62</b>. The resilient washers <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are disposed opposite to each other. Finally, the screw nut <b>70</b> is fixed via the screw thread <b>38</b> of the shaft portion <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In use, a pushing force is exerted on the display unit <b>100</b>, and, in turn, the display unit <b>100</b> causes the base seat <b>10</b> to likewise move. The resilient element <b>80</b> also rotates with the base seat <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the resilient element <b>80</b> generates a recovering force so as to balance out the pushing force. The protrusion <b>18</b> associated with the pivot flange <b>14</b> will rotate relative to an adjacent flat surface <b>36</b> of the pivotal shaft <b>30</b>. Because the pivotal shaft <b>30</b> is operatively fixed to the support body <b>200</b>, the display unit <b>100</b> rotates relative to the support body <b>200</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the adjusting degree range is limited by the configuration of the protrusions <b>18</b>. The first washers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are disposed between the base seat <b>10</b> and the fixing seat <b>20</b> and the first washer <b>43</b> is disposed at one side of the base seat <b>10</b>. This configuration may decrease the abrasion between the base seat <b>10</b> and the fixing seat <b>20</b> so as to prolong the use life.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In alternative embodiments, the pivotal shaft <b>30</b> is fastened, e.g., by means of a rivet or by a latch pin. In a similar fashion, the screw nut <b>70</b> and threaded portion <b>38</b> of the shaft portion <b>34</b> could, for example, be replaced with a latch pin and receiving hole combination. In alternative embodiments, the hinge assembly <b>300</b> is divided into two hinge assemblies. Each hinge assembly includes an independent base seat <b>10</b>, an independent fixing seat <b>20</b> and one pivot set. Two identical hinge assemblies are separately connected with the display unit <b>100</b> and the support body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, the &#x3c;-shaped (i.e., a wide-angle V shape) protrusion <b>18</b> needs to be disposed two sides. One such protrusion <b>18</b> is readily manufactured. A precision of rotation range is easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above-mentioned embodiments, the pivotal shaft <b>30</b> may be fixed with the fixing seat by other ways, for example, be replaced with riveting or welding. In an alternative embodiment, the pivotal shaft may be fixed with the base, and the engaging hole may be defined in the base. Furthermore, the retaining hole may be defined in the fixing seat. In an alternative embodiment, the pivotal shaft may be formed with a &#x3c;-shaped protrusion, and the retaining hole may be defined with at least one flat surface. Moreover, all of the washers disclosed above may be replaced with other structures that can perform such limiting function.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the preferred embodiments provides a hinge assembly <b>300</b> for devices such as a flat display screen, which is convenient for a user to operate and which is durable. It is, however, to be understood that the hinge assembly <b>300</b> could potentially be useful in other applications (e.g., a free-standing, adjustable mirror) in which it may be desirable to allow selective pivoting over a limited angular range.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p>
