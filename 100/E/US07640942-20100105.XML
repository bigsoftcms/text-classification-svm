<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first and the second posts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are long tubes and the bottoms thereof are connected with the first and the second lateral plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> respectively. To support the support <b>3</b>, the tops of the first and the second posts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are connected respectively to the first and the second support bars <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the support <b>3</b> that is nearest the rear ends of the first and the second lateral plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> among five supports <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The arched support leg <b>6</b> is an inverse U-shape round tube and two end feet thereof are provided with a positioning hole <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> respectively. The first and the second support legs <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are long tubes with a smaller diameter than that of each end foot and are provided with an elastic fastener <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> respectively. When the first and the second support legs <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are inserted into the two feet of the arched support leg <b>6</b> respectively, each elastic fastener <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> is located into one positioning hole <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> of the arched support leg <b>6</b>. Besides, the bottom of the first support leg <b>7</b> is pivotally connected to the upright plate <b>211</b> of the first lateral plate <b>21</b> while the bottom of the second support leg <b>8</b> is pivotally connected to the upright plate <b>221</b> of the second lateral plate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cover <b>9</b> is sewn by waterproof woven fabric and is provided with a falling part <b>91</b>, two holes <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>, and two air windows <b>94</b> at its rear end. The falling part <b>91</b> is a rectangular piece of cloth and the top thereof is sewn to the upper part of the cover <b>9</b>. The falling part <b>91</b> hangs down and covers the two air windows <b>94</b> and the bottom of the falling part <b>91</b> is connected with the arched support leg <b>6</b>. Besides, the two holes <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> are respectively provided at the left and the right sides of the rear end of the cover <b>9</b>. The first and the second support legs <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> are inserted through the holes <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> and then connected to two feet of the arched support leg <b>6</b> respectively, so that the falling part <b>91</b> can be propped open. (As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that shows a using state diagram of the present invention. When two feet of the arched support leg <b>6</b> slides upward along the first and the second support legs <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, the falling part <b>91</b> can be propped open by the positioning action via the elastic fasteners <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> of the first and the second support legs <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>. Consequently, a wilder space can be formed between the failing part <b>91</b> and the rear end of the cover <b>9</b> and air can flow freely through the two air windows <b>94</b> and the space. When the elastic fasteners <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> are released, the arched support leg <b>6</b> will slide downward owing to the weight of the arched support leg <b>6</b> and the falling part <b>91</b> and cover the two air windows <b>94</b>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a motorcycle is parked in the cover <b>9</b>. The stability of the present invention can be enhanced because the two ends of the bottom plate <b>23</b> are connected to the rear ends of the first and the second lateral plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> respectively and the motion of the first and the second lateral plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> can move other compartments of the present invention when the front wheel of the motorcycle is on the bottom plate <b>23</b> of the base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, an extension tube (not shown in figures) can be provided between the first and the second support bars <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of each support and two ends of the arched support bar <b>33</b> for various types of motorcycles. Consequently, the total length of the first and the second support bars <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> can be extended and the inner space of the cover <b>9</b> can be enlarged accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in order to make the support <b>3</b> more firm to prevent the support <b>3</b> from being tilted by wind, a third post <b>41</b> and a fourth post <b>51</b> are further provided in another embodiment according to the present invention. The third and the fourth posts <b>41</b>, <b>51</b> are long tubes. The tops of the third post <b>41</b> and the first post <b>4</b> are fixed to the same first support bar <b>31</b>. The tops of the fourth post <b>51</b> and the second post <b>5</b> are fixed to the same second support bar <b>32</b>. The bottom of the third post <b>41</b> is fixed to the top of one side of the bottom plate <b>23</b> while the bottom of the fourth post <b>51</b> is fixed to the top of another side of the bottom plate <b>23</b>. By this way, the first and the second support bars <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are supported outwardly by the third and the fourth support posts <b>41</b>, <b>51</b>. Thereby, the support <b>3</b> can be supported firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that shows another embodiment according to the present invention. In addition to the structure shown in the first embodiment, the present invention further has a positioning device <b>10</b> including a slidable element <b>101</b>, a stop piece <b>102</b>, and an elastic element <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The slidable element <b>101</b> is roughly in inversed-L shape and includes a vertical part <b>1011</b> and a transverse part <b>1012</b>. The bottom of the vertical part <b>1011</b> is against the lateral side of the first lateral plate <b>21</b>. The transverse part <b>1012</b> is provided with a channeled track <b>1013</b> that is in connection with the top of the first lateral plate <b>21</b>, so that the slidable element <b>101</b> can be in slidable connection with the first lateral plate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The stop piece <b>102</b> is pivotally connected to the vertical part <b>1011</b>. Alternatively, the stop piece <b>102</b> can also extends through the vertical part <b>1011</b>, that is, one end of the stop piece <b>102</b> protrudes from the lateral side of the vertical part <b>1011</b> while another end of the stop piece <b>102</b> protrudes from the medial side of the vertical part <b>1011</b>. A spring can be used as the elastic element <b>103</b> and is disposed between the end of the stop piece <b>102</b> protruding from the medial side of the vertical part <b>1011</b> and the medial side of the vertical part <b>1011</b>. Besides, the stop element <b>104</b> can be a screw and the first support bar <b>31</b> is pivotally connected to the first lateral plate <b>21</b> by a pivot that is formed from the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the first support bar <b>31</b> of one support <b>3</b>, the one nearest the anterior end of the first lateral plate <b>21</b> among five supports, is turned downward onto the ground, users push the slidable element <b>101</b> forward to have the elastic element <b>103</b> compressed by another end of the stop piece <b>102</b> and to have another end of the stop piece <b>102</b> passed through the stop element <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the elastic element <b>103</b> restores its original length, another end of the stop piece <b>102</b> can be limited at the anterior end of the stop element <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the transverse part <b>1012</b> of the slidable element <b>101</b> can be against upper part of the first support bar <b>31</b>, so that the first support bar <b>31</b> can be positioned. When users push the end of the stop piece <b>102</b> that protrudes from the lateral side of the vertical part <b>1011</b>, the elastic element <b>104</b> will be pressed by another end of the stop piece <b>102</b> again, so that the slidable element <b>101</b> is moved backward and the first support bar <b>31</b> is relieved.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In practice, there are two positioning devices <b>10</b> used to position the first and the second support bars <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, the present invention has the following advantages:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0035">1. Because air can flow freely through the cover according to the present invention, the free flow of air can prevent high temperature within the cover and thus the lifetime of a motorcycle parked in the cover can be extended.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0036">2. Because the extent of air convection between the inside and the outside of the cover can be adjusted flexibly according to the present invention, the air window can be opened to an approximate extent generally and closed when attacked by a typhoon to prevent from rain or blowing wind.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0037">3. The inner side of the falling part is provided with an airflow circuit and the falling part is designed to tilt downward. Consequently, when users prop falling part and make the air window open, it is unnecessary to worry about the problem that rain is splashed into the cover when it rains heavily and accidentally.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0038">4. The cover according to the present invention can be folded backward with the movement of each support and can be operated without touching the motorcycle parked therein, so that it is convenient to use and can prevent the cover from rubbing against the surface of the motorcycle.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0039">5. Because the cover can be spaced apart from the motorcycle parked therein in a sufficient distance according to the present invention, the problem that the conventional automobile covers cannot be applied onto automobiles when the automobiles are parked outside in rainy days or when exhaust pipes of the automobiles are still at high temperature.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0040">6. The positioning device of the present invention can be used to position the support bar of a support and prevent the displacement of the support caused by wind. Thereby, the cover can be kept stable to protect motorcycles placed therein effectively.</li>
</ul>
