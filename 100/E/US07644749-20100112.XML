<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to membrane displays, and more particularly, to a tensioned membrane display backdrop.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical attachment of tension-membrane/fabric to frames wraps the fabric around the frame. Examples include canvas stretched around a wooden frame and tacked or nailed on the back of the frame, like the traditional painting canvases. Other systems include plastic splines or clips attached to fabrics and secured to the face surface of the frame, whereby the fabric is pulled parallel to the surface of the frame. In both known systems, the tension on the fabric applies a shear force to the fasteners. Complex frames require complex and difficult-to install constructions of fabric. There are several modular frame systems on the market which are used for exhibits, events, architecture, museums and retail environments. These frame systems can be structural or decorative. Most are made of aluminum extrusions. Most use some kind of clamp to assemble one frame member to another. These clamps typically engage the flanges of a groove or channel in the adjacent frame member. This groove is also used to retain panels which can be finished with wall coverings or graphics. With the recent increase in the use of tension fabric in these applications, the benefits of a way to attach fabric directly to the frame, substituting for a rigid panel, are apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is needed, therefore, are techniques for removably attaching a tensioned fabric to a tensioning display frame.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">One embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>5</b> comprises a tubular frame <b>12</b> with elongate tubular members <b>14</b> wherein are disposed longitudinal channels <b>16</b> configured to receive fabric or membrane tension retention strips <b>18</b>. The tubular members <b>14</b> may be joined at the corners of the frame <b>12</b> or the end of a member may join the body of a second member, thus forming an interior bracing member <b>20</b>. The fabric or membrane retention strips <b>18</b> may in one embodiment be provided with a groove or depression <b>22</b> best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> running along the length of the retention strip <b>18</b> and dividing the retention strip <b>18</b> into at least first and second retention sides <b>26</b>, to which depression <b>22</b> membrane <b>24</b> is sewn or otherwise affixed at centerline <b>25</b> through the use of stitches, mechanical fasteners, ultrasonic welding, heat bonding, or adhesives. In other embodiments no such groove is provided, while in still further embodiments, a stitching tongue <b>72</b> may be provided orthogonally to the strip to attach the membrane to the strip. The membrane retention or anchoring strips <b>18</b> may be configured to be inserted into and removed from the longitudinal channels <b>16</b> without disassembling the frame <b>12</b>, thereby facilitating the change of membranes <b>24</b> in displays. The membrane is held in tension orthogonally or non-parallel to the surface of the frame in which the retainer or anchor <b>18</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that a variety of membranes may be used, including but not limited to synthetic and natural woven, knit, and non woven textiles, leathers, plastics, vinyl films, reinforced vinyl films, textile and metal and plastic meshes and screens, polypropylene films, Mylar films, and urethane films and other polymer films and membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to various embodiments of the present invention, assorted shapes of tubular frame members <b>14</b> may be used, having substantially rectangular, square, triagonal, trapezoidal, rhomboidal, polygonal, oval or circular cross sections. A cross section of a square member is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrating the member with anchors or retainers installed and without, respectively. Similarly, longitudinal channels <b>16</b> may be configured in a variety of cross sectional forms, including but not limited to rectangular, circular, and square, so long as the channel <b>16</b> has sufficient capacity to accept the strip and afford the strip room to orient itself in a toggle position. Members may be provided with a plurality of channels disposed longitudinally along the sides of those members. Members may be configured from a variety of materials, metals such as, but not limited to, aluminum, brass, steel, woods such as, but not limited to, mahogany, oak, pine, and plastics. Such materials may be solid or hollow, and may be machined, carved or extruded to create channels <b>16</b>. Members may be designed specifically for the system or may be commercially available seperately, such as those marketed by OCTANORM-Vertriebs-GmbH.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Some embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, employ flat plastic retention strips <b>18</b>. While in such embodiments no tab is used to attach the membrane, as the membrane can be affixed directly to the flat strip. Other embodiments may employ tongues <b>72</b> to fasten the membrane to the anchor or retainer. In one embodiment, the membrane is sewn to the center of a first side of the strip. The resulting seam may be disposed in a depressed, concave, or routed channel <b>22</b> to facilitate the stitching and to facilitate flexing of the strip <b>18</b> along the seam. In various embodiments, the strip <b>18</b> is configured such that the sides of the strip <b>26</b> may be compressed, bent, or folded to allow passage of the strip <b>18</b> into the channel <b>16</b>, but then resiliently return to its expanded or unfolded position to prevent the unintended removal of the strip <b>18</b> from the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, no depression <b>22</b> need be made in the retention strip <b>18</b>. In such embodiments, distortion of the strip is of diminished importance as the strip may tilt in the member channel <b>16</b> to permit the strip to slide past the edges of the member channel <b>16</b>. Applying tension to the membrane <b>24</b> draws the retention strip <b>18</b> into contact with the member channel <b>16</b> opening, causing it to engage, like a toggle, preventing the membrane <b>24</b> from being pulled free of the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an alternative embodiment, the membrane retention strips <b>18</b> may be configured having a T cross section. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other embodiments of the present invention may have different cross sections, with asymmetrical protrusions from the central core. Such strips, shaped like letters &#x201c;d&#x201d;, &#x201c;L&#x201d;, &#x201c;V&#x201d; and &#x201c;J&#x201d; may also permit removal or replacement of the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to one embodiment, the strip <b>18</b> may be configured from flexible polymers, such as, but not limited to, extruded polyester, low and high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polycarbonate. The material from which the strip <b>18</b> is made must be flexible enough to deform to permit its introduction into, and removal from the channels <b>16</b>. Such deformation does not need, in all embodiments, to be great, and where sufficient room is afforded for toggling, rigid or semi rigid retention strips <b>18</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment of the present invention a method for installing a tensioned membrane <b>24</b> is provided, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>, wherein a membrane retention strip <b>18</b> is sewn or otherwise attached to the periphery of a membrane <b>24</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the channel <b>16</b>, is configured to receive the strip through an opening disposed between flanges <b>36</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> the retention strip <b>18</b> is aligned with twisted and inserted diagonally into the channel <b>16</b> of a frame member <b>14</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the retention strip <b>18</b> is introduced into the channel <b>16</b> by means of a spline tool <b>30</b> such as those commonly used in the repair and manufacture of screen door panels. Other tools, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 15</figref> whereby a curved end portion <b>64</b> can be used to press the strip into the channel, or even flat head screwdrivers may be used to force the retention strip <b>18</b> into the channel <b>16</b>. Once the retainer <b>18</b> is seated into the channel <b>16</b> it is brought into contact with frame channel flanges <b>36</b> where it returns to its original shape thereby securing the screen, fabric or membrane <b>24</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref> illustrate methods by which the strip may be removed using a hook <b>50</b> or flat prying end <b>68</b> of the tool illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a channel configured with deep flanges <b>36</b> and a shallow channel <b>16</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the membrane <b>24</b> is stitched to a central groove of the strip <b>18</b>, such that the strip is easily flexible and the strip may be creased along the groove to allow it to be disposed within the channel. The strip <b>18</b> is then disposed within the channel as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, providing tension on the membrane <b>24</b> and thus holding the retention strip in place.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates a channel <b>16</b> that is deep but configured with shallow flanges <b>36</b> and walls <b>37</b> proximal to the strip <b>18</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the membrane <b>24</b> of this embodiment is affixed to the side of the strip <b>18</b> that is disposed distal to the flanges <b>36</b>. Strip <b>18</b> is inserted such that the surface of the strip <b>18</b> that is fastened to the membrane <b>24</b> is inserted first and the side not in contact with the membrane is lowered into the channel <b>16</b> past the flanges last. When, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, tension is applied to the membrane <b>24</b>, the membrane <b>24</b> is forced against a flange <b>36</b>, in turn forcing the strip <b>18</b> against the wall <b>37</b> of the channel <b>16</b>. The strip <b>18</b>, and thus the membrane <b>24</b>, is thereby secured in the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref> illustrate installation of a curved retention strip <b>62</b> in a curved channel <b>60</b>. The strip <b>62</b> is inserted on edge, rotated and positioned against the flanges <b>36</b>. The membrane <b>24</b> is then in its tensioned position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A similar process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> where a rigid or semi-rigid strip is inserted between flanges <b>36</b> and secured behind the flanges <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a tool configured to install and remove strips configured in accord with one embodiment of the present invention. The tool is provided with a curved installation end <b>64</b>, which allows the strip to be pressed into the channel without damage to or crimping of the strip. A removal end <b>66</b> is configured with a flat head prying tool <b>68</b> by which the strip may be pried up, past the flanges and released. The removal end is also configured in one embodiment with grooves or texture <b>70</b> to provide a secure hand grip when using the installation end <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment of the present invention, the attachment of the membrane to the strip utilizes a specially configured sewing machine presser foot illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16C</figref>. Such a specialized presser foot attachment <b>40</b> may be configured with an attaching column <b>44</b> that attaches the foot block <b>43</b> to the machine, a notched bottom profile <b>42</b> to receive the retention strip <b>18</b> and to center the retention strip beneath the foot <b>40</b>, and to hold the membrane in contact with the machine feed mechanism <b>46</b>. The sewing machine needle and thread <b>48</b> is deployed through a hole disposed in the front half of the top of the foot <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention provides a strip removal tool <b>50</b> comprising a handle <b>52</b> and a hook <b>54</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18B</figref>, the strip removal tool may be used to engage the strip and begin the removal process, orienting the strip <b>18</b> for removal. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18C and 18D</figref> curved notches <b>54</b> may be disposed at points or at a single point along the strip <b>18</b> to allow the tool <b>50</b> to obtain a greater purchase on the strip, and to facilitate the removal thereof.</p>
