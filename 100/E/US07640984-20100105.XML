<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a cement float collar and a method of wellbore completion and, in particular, a through-tubing cement float collar and method for drilling and completing a wellbore using casing as the drill string.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The drilling of wells, for example, for oil and gas production, conventionally employs relatively small diameter strings of drill pipe to which is secured a drill bit of somewhat larger diameter. After a selected portion of the well bore has been drilled, the wellbore is usually lined with a string of tubulars known as casing. The term casing is used herein to encompass any wellbore liner. The casing normally has a larger diameter than the drill pipe and a smaller diameter than the operational drill bit. This conventional system which requires sequentially drilling the borehole using drill pipe with a drill bit attached thereto, pulling the drill pipe out of the hole and running casing into the borehole is time consuming and costly. In addition, each time that a drilling bit needs to be changed, which happens several times during any drilling operation, the drill pipe must be tripped in and out. As a consequence, the process of drilling with casing is gaining popularity as a method of drilling wherein the casing is used as the drilling conduit though which the bit is moved, and after drilling, the casing remains downhole to act as the wellbore liner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To achieve simultaneous drilling and casing, a specialized drilling assembly is required which drills a borehole of sufficient diameter to accommodate the casing and which is retrievable through the casing. The drilling assembly typically includes a drill bit and one or more hole enlargement tools such as for example an underreamer. The drilling assembly is deployed on the advancing end of the casing. The drill bit can be retractable and/or removable through the casing by electric wireline, braided wire rope or other means.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a drilling operation is complete the drill bit is retracted through the casing and the casing is left downhole for lining the well. Completion of the cased well, which requires pumping cement into the annulus between the casing and the wellbore wall, is difficult in wells formed using casing drilling since the casing does not contain a cement float shoe, also known as a cement float collar. Since it is necessary to complete a wellbore with cement, the cement was pumped down through the casing and maintained in the annulus by holding a pressure within the casing until the cement hardens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While previous through-tubing cement float collars are known such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,413,682, 5,323,858, 3,159,219 and 4,589,495, those float collars and methods for completion are not useful in casing drilling operations. In particular, a casing string having inner restrictions for latching a through tubing float collar is not suitable for use in casing drilling. The manipulation of the casing string or cement float collar using a tubing string within the casing is not suitable for most casing drilling operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A cement float collar is disclosed that can be positioned downhole and used in a wellbore completion operation after drilling a wellbore with casing. A wellbore drilling and completion method is also disclosed. The cement float collar is made for pumping downhole and into engagement with a groove formed in the casing, called the profile nipple. As such, no restriction is needed in the casing for accepting or latching the float collar and the portion of casing including the groove can be installed at the start of the drilling operation. In addition, the profile nipple can be used to engage other drilling tools and, therefore, can already be in place when the final well depth (TD) is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cement float collar for use in a casing string to be used to line a wellbore, the casing including an annular groove at a lower distal end thereof, the annular groove having a diameter greater than the inner diameter of the casing string, the cement float collar comprising: a main body having a bore therethrough extending from its upper end to its lower end; a flow restriction assembly mountable in the bore to prevent flow of fluids therethrough at least from the lower end to the upper end of the main body; a sealing member disposed about the main body; a radially outwardly biased collar retained in an annular recess about the main body, the expanded outer diameter of the collar being greater than the inner diameter of the casing string in which it is to be used, the cement float with the collar compressed into the recess being sized to pass through the casing string with the sealing member creating a seal between the main body and the casing string, the seal being sufficient to substantially seal against fluids passing between the main body and the casing string at fluid pressures encountered in a wellbore completion operation and the collar being latchable into the groove of the casing string.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The collar is preferably formed of an outer bearing surface of durable material and an inner portion formed of drillable material. This combination of materials provides that the collar can withstand the rigours of passage downhole and is capable of latching into the groove but can be drilled out to permit the removal of substantially all of the float collar should this be necessary, for example, to extend the borehole.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a cement float collar <b>10</b> according to the present invention is shown. Cement float collar <b>10</b> is formed to pass through a string of casing tubing, a portion of which is shown at <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Casing tubing <b>12</b><i>a </i>has a standard minimum inner diameter ID<sub>1 </sub>so as not to limit the size of a tool that can pass therethrough. An annular groove <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) is formed, as by milling, in a profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>adapted to connect into the casing string by, for example, threaded connections. The diameter D<sub>2 </sub>in groove <b>14</b> is slightly larger than the minimum inner diameter of the casing tubing. The cement float collar is formed to be pumped though a string of casing and to latch into and be retained in the annular groove, as will be more fully described hereinafter. The annular groove is formed to permit the cement float collar to be accepted without consideration as to the rotational orientation of the float collar in the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the cement float collar in a position being moved through a section of casing while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the cement float collar <b>10</b> secured in the casing in the annular groove of a profile nipple.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Cement float-collar <b>10</b> includes a main body <b>16</b> having a longitudinal bore <b>18</b> extending from its upper end <b>16</b>&#x2032; to its lower end <b>16</b>&#x2033;. Main body <b>16</b> is sized to pass easily through ID<sub>1</sub>, of the size of casing in which it is intended to be used. To facilitate manufacture, main body is preferably formed from a plurality of parts including, for example, an upper section <b>16</b><i>a </i>and a lower mandrel section <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Parts <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be connected together in any way that provides a rigid connection therebetween. In the illustrated embodiment, sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are joined at threaded connection <b>20</b>. Parts <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be formed of any materials capable of at least for short periods withstanding downhole conditions. In some embodiments, the parts <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>must also be formed of materials capable of being drilled out such as, for example, aluminum or polyvinylchloride.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A float valve is positioned in bore <b>18</b> to permit only one-way flow therethrough from upper end <b>16</b>&#x2032; to lower end <b>16</b>&#x2033;. While other one-way valves such as, for example, ball valves, are useful, the illustrated valve includes a flapper valve <b>22</b> mounted via a hinge pin <b>24</b> to a flapper valve housing <b>26</b>. As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, flapper valve <b>22</b> is formed to seal against a seat <b>26</b>&#x2032; formed by housing <b>26</b> when a flow of fluid moves through the bore in a direction from lower end <b>16</b>&#x2033; to upper end <b>16</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Flapper valve <b>22</b> is normally biased into the sealing position against seat <b>26</b>&#x2032; by a spring <b>27</b> such as, for example, a torsion spring acting about hinge pin <b>24</b>. Bore <b>18</b> is enlarged at <b>28</b> to accommodate flapper valve housing <b>26</b>. Flapper valve housing <b>26</b> is maintained in position within the bore by abutment against lower section <b>16</b><i>b</i>, where it is screwed into engagement with upper section <b>16</b><i>a</i>. Other valve types such as, for example, ball valves can be used, as desired, provided that they are durable enough to withstand the passage of cement therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For pumping downhole, a releasable plug <b>30</b> is disposed in bore <b>18</b>. Releasable plug <b>30</b> is selected to remain in plugging position within bore <b>18</b> up to a selected maximum pressure. At pressures above the selected maximum pressure, plug <b>30</b> is driven out of bore <b>18</b>. While many suitable pressure releasable plugs are known, the illustrated float collar includes a plug having a flange <b>32</b> engaged between valve housing <b>26</b> and lower section <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The plug is held in the bore by engagement of flange <b>32</b> against the shoulders formed by valve housing <b>26</b> and lower section <b>16</b><i>b </i>and by frictional engagement of the body of plug <b>30</b> against the walls of bore <b>18</b>. When pressures acting against the plug are increased above the selected maximum pressure, the flange shears away from the plug body and the force of frictional engagement between plug <b>30</b> and the bore walls is overcome such that the plug is expelled from bore <b>18</b>. The plug can be held in place by several different means such as, for example, shear screws. In another embodiment, a burst plate is used rather than a plug that is expelled. In a standard completion operation, the selected maximum pressure for expelling the plug is greater than the normal pressure required to pump the plug down the casing that is normally less than 500 psi. In a preferred embodiment, releasable plug <b>30</b> is selected to remain in place in the bore unless fluid pressures above the plug exceed about 1000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A collar <b>36</b> is mounted about the main body and is biased radially outwardly therefrom to engage in groove <b>14</b> of the profile nipple. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, collar <b>36</b> includes an outer C-ring <b>38</b> and, attached there to, as by fasteners <b>39</b>, a plurality of spaced-apart dogs <b>40</b>. Collar <b>36</b> is biased outwardly by C-ring <b>38</b> that has an expanded outer diameter greater than ID<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spaces between dogs <b>40</b> permit the collar to be compressed against the spring force in C-ring <b>38</b> to fit into ID<sub>1</sub>, of the casing string. The spring force in C-ring <b>38</b> is selected such that when the collar is compressed into the bore of a casing string, the force exerted outwardly by the collar can be overcome to move the collar and the float collar through the casing string by application of fluid pressure of about 500 psi to the cement float collar. The C-ring need only have the force to expand into the groove when it is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">C-ring <b>38</b> has a length between its leading edge <b>38</b>&#x2032; and its trailing edge <b>38</b>&#x2033; that is less than the width w of groove <b>14</b> such that the C-ring can expand into the groove. Groove <b>14</b> is formed with a wall <b>14</b>&#x2032;, that steps generally abruptly from D<b>2</b> to ID<sub>1</sub>. The exposed corner <b>41</b> of wall <b>14</b>&#x2032; can be radiused, as shown, to facilitate movement therepast of equipment, for example during drilling. However, any radius should not be so great as to inhibit or jeopardize firm latching of the C-ring into groove <b>14</b>. When the C-ring expands into groove <b>14</b> it becomes latched in it by abutment of leading edge <b>38</b>&#x2032; against wall <b>14</b>&#x2032; of groove <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Upwards movement of cement float collar <b>10</b> is limited by abutment of edge <b>38</b>&#x2033; against the upper wall of the groove (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). While the upper wall of the groove preferably steps abruptly from D<b>2</b> to ID<sub>1</sub>, again it may be necessary to ramp this wall to prevent catching of drilling equipment on the wall. However, the ramping should not interfere with the secure latching of the collar within the groove. Leading edge <b>38</b>&#x2032; is preferably curved as by rolling to facilitate movement through the casing string and over discontinuities such as casing connections. Any such curvature, however, must be of a limited radius so as to avoid interference with secure latching of the C-ring into groove <b>14</b> and abutment against wall <b>14</b>&#x2032;. While a cement plug can be used which is not drillable, in most applications it will be required that the plug be removable in order to expand the borehole. In one embodiment, the dogs are made of easily drillable materials such as, for example, aluminum or composites such as fiberglass. The fasteners are also formed of drillable material such as brass. However, since drillable materials are generally fragile and weak, particularly in tension, they may not capable of riding against the casing wall without failing and may not be capable of possessing the spring tension necessary for functioning of the collar. Therefore, the C-ring is preferably formed of a durable material capable of withstanding the rigors of passing downhole in engagement with the casing wall, the material also having spring tension, such as spring steel. The C-ring does not have be formed of drillable materials as it will be located in the groove out of the way of a drilling tool should one be used to remove the cement plug from the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Collar <b>36</b> is retained in an annular recess <b>42</b> on main body <b>16</b>. Annular recess <b>42</b> is positioned substantially orthogonal to the long axis 10&#xd7; of the main body. In a preferred embodiment, recess <b>42</b> is formed with a sloping, frusto-conical upper portion <b>44</b> and a sloping, frusto-conical lower portion <b>46</b>. Dogs <b>40</b> are each formed with tapered ends <b>40</b>&#x2032; such that the inner surfaces of the collar also define two generally frusto-conical surfaces selected to substantially mate with the surfaces of the recess. Movement of float collar <b>10</b> through collar <b>36</b> is limited by coacting of tapered ends <b>40</b>&#x2032; with frusto-conical portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of recess <b>42</b>. In particular, movement of the float collar through the collar causes dogs <b>40</b> to be wedged between float collar body <b>16</b> and profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To facilitate passage of the cement float collar through the casing string preferably recess <b>42</b> includes a stop wall <b>48</b> against which dogs <b>40</b> abut when in the compressed position. Stop wall <b>48</b> prevents movement of collar <b>36</b> upwardly on the cement float collar main body to thereby, prevent wedging of the dogs between the main body and the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To prevent fluid flow between cement float collar <b>10</b> and casing string <b>12</b><i>a </i>during pumping down and between cement float collar <b>10</b> and profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>when in position in groove <b>14</b>, a plurality of seals <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>are provided about the cement float collar main body. As will be appreciated the seals are sized to extend out from main body to be in sealing engagement with casing when the cement float collar is positioned in a string of casing. Seals <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>are mounted in a recess formed in the main body and maintained in position by a threaded cup retainer <b>52</b>, a coupling ring <b>54</b> and a spacer ring <b>56</b>. Other secure mounting arrangements can be used as desired. Seals <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>are each cup-type seals. Seal <b>50</b><i>a </i>is arranged to act against passage of fluid therepast in a downhole direction while seals <b>50</b><i>b </i>are arranged to act against passage of fluid uphole. While three cup-type seals have been used in the illustrated embodiment, other numbers and types of seals can be used provided they create a seal against a passage of fluids between the cement float collar and the casing. Self-energizing seals such as cup seals are preferred as they are easy to work with and facilitate the pumping conveyance of the float collar. Other seals such as a standard packer could be used but may require energizing such as by pump pressure, drill pipe or tubing etc.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The seals must be able to withstand significant pressures which would be encountered in a wellbore completion operation. As an example, in one embodiment, the seals must be able to withstand about 1,000 psi from above during plug <b>30</b> shearing and, when holding the cement in place in the annulus, the seals must act against typically less than 2,000 psi from the bottom but sometimes as much as 3,000 psi from the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Pump down cement float <b>10</b> is useful in casing drilling. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, when drilling with casing, well casing string <b>12</b><i>a </i>is used as the drill string and will thereafter be used as the wellbore liner. The wellbore <b>58</b> is formed using the casing string <b>12</b><i>a </i>with a drilling assembly <b>60</b> attached at the distal end of the casing string which is formed as a profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The drilling assembly is retrievable from the lower distal end of the drill string without withdrawing the casing string from the wellbore being formed by drilling assembly <b>60</b>. The casing must be open to permit passage and manipulation of the drilling assembly. The groove <b>14</b> in profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>does not restrict passage and manipulation of the drilling assembly and can be installed on the casing string at the beginning of the drilling operation and the wellbore is drilled using a casing string including annular groove <b>14</b> at a lower distal end thereof at the location in which it is desired to locate a cement float during a completion operation. As an example, annular groove <b>14</b> can be positioned about 30 to 40 feet from the distal end of the casing string. The profile nipple can contain other recesses for use in securing other downhole tools.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When drilling is complete and it is desired to seal the annulus between the casing and the wellbore, the drilling assembly is removed through the casing string while leaving the casing string in place in the wellbore. Groove <b>14</b>, having a diameter greater than that of the casing string, does not inhibit the passage of the drilling assembly or other downhole tools.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 1</figref>, once the drilling assembly is removed, a pump down cement float <b>10</b> is selected that is capable of sealably passing through the casing string and latching into groove <b>14</b>. The selected cement float is inserted into the casing string by compressing collar <b>36</b> into recess <b>42</b> and behind stop wall <b>48</b> such that the float collar fits within ID<sub>1 </sub>of the casing string. The pressure of fluid, such as cement slurry or water, is increased (indicated by arrow A) against upper end <b>16</b>&#x2032; of float <b>10</b> to move it through the casing. The fluid pressure acts against seal <b>50</b><i>b</i>, main body <b>16</b> and plug <b>30</b> to drive the float against the force of C-ring <b>38</b> engaging the casing string wall. Pressures of between about 50 and 500 psi are required to move a float collar as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through a casing string.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Cement float <b>10</b> is pumped through the casing string until collar <b>36</b> lands in and expands into groove <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>C. When this occurs, the cement float is stopped by abutment of leading edge <b>38</b>&#x2032; against groove wall <b>14</b>&#x2032; and subsequent wedging of dogs <b>40</b> between casing profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>and main body <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To prepare the cement float for regulating the flow of cement, the pressure of the fluid (indicated by arrow B) uphole of the cement float collar is increased to a pressure selected to shear out plug <b>30</b> and allow fluid to flow through bore <b>18</b> of the float collar. Reversing fluid flow toward surface causes flapper valve <b>22</b> to seat. Cement can then be pumped downhole, through cement float <b>10</b> and up the annulus about the casing to complete the wellbore. A displacement plug (not shown) can be pumped down after the cement and lands on the cement float. When pressure is released at surface, the cement in the annulus tends to exert pressure to move back into the casing, called U-tubing. This causes flapper valve <b>22</b> to seal against seat <b>26</b>&#x2032; maintaining the cement in the annulus. Should float collar <b>10</b> move upwardly in groove <b>14</b>, dogs <b>40</b> will become wedged between upper conical surface <b>44</b> of the recess and profile nipple <b>12</b><i>b </i>to prevent further movement of the float collar. Seals <b>50</b><i>b </i>prevent the cement from bypassing about the float collar.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The wellbore can be drilled, the cement float can be placed and the wellbore completed all without removing the casing string from the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If it is later desired to extend the wellbore, it is possible to renter the casing string with a drilling assembly. Cement float <b>10</b>, preferably being formed of drillable materials such a composites, aluminium, brass and/or polymers, can be drilled out along with the hardened cement. Since the groove has a diameter greater than that of the casing string, the drilling operation can open the casing up to substantially its original inner diameter without interference by the cement float or the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another embodiment of a cement float <b>300</b> according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Cement float <b>300</b> includes a main body <b>316</b> with an axial bore <b>318</b> therethrough. A releasable plug <b>30</b> (shown being expelled from the bore) and a collar <b>36</b> are as described hereinbefore with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. One way flow restriction through the float is provided by a displacement plug <b>320</b>. Displacement plug <b>320</b> is pumpable downhole and latches into bore <b>318</b>. In particular, plug <b>320</b> includes seals <b>324</b> extending therefrom to provide a seal against the casing, thereby, facilitating pumping downhole. The leading end <b>320</b>&#x2032; of the plug is sized to be insertable into bore <b>318</b> and has a plurality of hooks or ribs <b>326</b> extending therefrom that securely catch in a plurality of grooves <b>328</b> formed in the upper end of bore <b>318</b>. Other engagement arrangements can be used such as, for example, a snap ring instead of the grooves. The engagement between hooks <b>326</b> and grooves <b>328</b> is sufficiently strong to retain plug <b>320</b> in the bore against pressures of typically less than 2,000 psi but preferably up to about 3,000 psi from below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, main body <b>316</b>, with releasable plug <b>30</b> in bore <b>318</b>, is pumped down until collar <b>36</b> expands into groove <b>14</b>. Pressure is increased until releasable plug <b>30</b> is sheared from bore <b>318</b>. Cement is then pumped downhole through the casing string and bore <b>318</b> of cement float <b>300</b>. When the appropriate amount of cement has been pumped down, the displacement plug <b>320</b> is launched and pumped down after the cement until it latches into bore <b>318</b> of main body <b>316</b>. Plug <b>320</b> acts against U-tubing of the cement.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be apparent that many other changes may be made to the illustrative embodiments, while falling within the scope of the invention and it is intended that all such changes be covered by the claims appended hereto.</p>
