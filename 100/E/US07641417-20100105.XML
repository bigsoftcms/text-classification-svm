<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC07-05ID14517 between the United States Department of Energy and Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention pertains to tire deflation devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Deflation of one or more tires of a vehicle is one method that is utilized to disable or stop a vehicle. Deflation devices such as barrier strips are often utilized by law enforcement to disable a fleeing vehicle. Such devices are typically placed in the path of an oncoming vehicle and are configured to puncture one or more tires of the vehicle as the vehicle passes over the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of deflation devices have been developed which have either solid spikes or hollow spikes. In some instances, the spikes are removable such that upon puncturing a vehicle tire the spike becomes detached from the device to remain imbedded in the tire. When a hollow type spike is utilized to puncture a tire and is retained by the tire, such can serve as an air passageway allowing air to pass through the hollow spike to efficiently deflate the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Removable spikes, either hollow or solid types, can be difficult to mount utilizing conventional spike retention systems. Additionally, conventional devices can have spikes that are difficult to remove from the device such that spikes remain in the device rather than becoming lodged in the punctured tire. Further, some conventional spike retention systems allow spikes to easily disengage from the device such that spikes become lost or otherwise unintentionally removed from the device prior to tire puncture. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop alternative spike retainers and tire deflation devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect the invention provides a tire deflation device including a spike retainer. The spike retainer includes a bore in a material where the bore includes a receiving region, a sidewall surface and a base surface. A channel extends from the sidewall surface of the bore into the material. The spike retainer additionally includes a keeper which has a first section housed within the channel and a second section which extends past the sidewall surface into the receiving region of the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect the invention provides a spike retainer which includes a bore in a component. The bore has a receiving region and a base surface. The spike retainer additionally includes a keeper which extends through the base surface and has a segment disposed within the receiving region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect the invention provides a tire deflation device. The device includes at least one component having a plurality of bores and includes a plurality of spikes removably insertable into the plurality of bores. A keeper is provided within each of the bores and is configured to extend along a sidewall of the spike and exert force upon the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect the invention provides a method of reversibly retaining a spike. A bore is provided in a material and a channel is provided which passes through the sidewall of the bore into the material. A keeper is positioned such that a first segment is within the channel and a second segment is disposed within a spike receiving region of the bore. A spike is inserted into the receiving region of the bore.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws &#x201c;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&#x201d; (Article 1, Section 8).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Numerous and diverse tire deflation devices have been developed which utilize spikes to puncture vehicle tires and thereby debilitate or disable the vehicle. In particular instances it can be preferable that the spikes be retained in a given device sufficiently to avoid or minimize unintentional loss or removal of the spikes, while allowing such spikes to be withdrawn upon sufficient force such as, for example, when the spike punctures or otherwise penetrates a vehicle tire. The aspects of the invention described below can allow spikes to be easily mounted within a device and can provide sufficient force to the mounted spikes to retain such spikes in the mounted position until the created tension is overcome by a significant force such as occurs when the spike embeds within, punctures or penetrates a vehicle tire.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary tire deflation device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, is described in great detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,588 which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such illustrates a tire deflation device <b>10</b> having a rotatable shaft <b>12</b> in which one or more spikes <b>16</b> are retained. Spike <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown as being inserted partially into a tire <b>100</b>. In the exemplary device shown, rotatable shaft <b>12</b> is provided to allow rotation of spike <b>16</b> such that the spike can be housed in a recessed area <b>14</b> when the device is not in use or prior to activation or &#x201c;arming&#x201d; of the device. The &#x201c;unarmed&#x201d; device is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where shaft <b>12</b> is rotated such that spike <b>16</b> is recessed within device <b>10</b>. In this recessed position, tire <b>100</b> can roll over device <b>10</b> without being punctured by the spike. Deployment of the device as fully described in issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,588 rotates shaft <b>12</b> into an armed position similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, positioning spike <b>16</b> to allow penetration and deflation of tire <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,588, exemplary device <b>10</b> can comprise modules each comprising one or more spikes, and such modules can be connected or inter-joined by, for example, providing a cable through a cable passage <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Utilization of the spike retainers and spike retention methodology of the invention can allow easy insertion and mounting of spike <b>16</b> into a device component such as rotatable shaft <b>12</b> of the exemplary device shown. The retainers of the invention can additionally allow stable yet releasable retention of a spike in operative connection with the component <b>12</b> with a retention force that can be overcome by puncturing of a tire by the spike thereby allowing disengagement of the spike from shaft <b>12</b>. These beneficial features can be also achieved in alternative barrier strip devices using retainers and methodology of the invention adapted for the particular device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Exemplary methodology and spike retainer configurations of the invention are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>. Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a deflation device <b>10</b> can be provided having a component or material <b>12</b> into which a spike is to be inserted. Component <b>12</b> can be a metallic component or can comprise alternative materials such as plastics or composites. In particular aspects, component <b>12</b> can be a rotatable shaft such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. A bore <b>20</b> can be provided to extend from an outer surface <b>18</b> of component <b>12</b> into the component. Bore <b>20</b> has a spike receiving region <b>22</b> configured to receive a spike. The dimensions of bore <b>20</b> are not limited to any particular values and can be adjusted based on the dimensions of the particular spike to be utilized. As illustrated in the top view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, bore <b>20</b> can be a circular bore configured to receive a tubular or cylindrical spike. However, it is to be understood that the invention contemplates alternative bore shapes configured to receive a spike having at least a base portion which is non-circular.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In particular applications it can be preferable that bore <b>20</b> have a perimeter/circumference slightly larger that the outer circumference of the particular spike to be inserted. In an application of the invention where component <b>12</b> is a shaft such as the rotatable shaft illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an exemplary spike can have an outer diameter of about &#x215b; inches. Accordingly, bore <b>12</b> in this application can preferably have a bore diameter of slightly greater than about &#x215b; inch. The depth of bore <b>20</b> as measured from upper surface <b>18</b> can also vary based upon the spike size and/or the size of component <b>12</b>, among other things. For one particular embodiment, an exemplary bore can have a bore depth of about 0.60 inches, and a bore diameter of about 0.35 inches. It is to be understood that the bore size is not limited to any particular value. Similarly, the ratio of bore depth to bore diameter can also vary depending upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a channel <b>26</b> can be provided to extend into material <b>12</b> through sidewall surface <b>21</b> of bore <b>20</b>. Channel <b>26</b> can extend from upper surface <b>18</b> the entire depth of bore <b>20</b> to a base surface <b>24</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, channel <b>26</b> can be provided to extend less than the entire bore depth from upper surface <b>18</b>. Preferably, channel <b>26</b> extends a sufficient length along sidewall <b>21</b> to accommodate a keeper in accordance with the invention (discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the particular spike retainer configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, channel <b>26</b> can be described as having a first portion <b>27</b> which extends along sidewall <b>21</b>. Channel <b>26</b> has a second portion <b>28</b> which is a surface portion extending along outer surface <b>18</b> from bore <b>20</b> to an opening <b>29</b> extending through upper surface <b>18</b> of component <b>12</b>. Opening <b>29</b> can alternatively be described as being a third portion of channel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with the invention, a keeper <b>30</b> can be provided to assist in retaining a spike with receiving region <b>22</b> of bore <b>20</b>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, retainer <b>30</b> can be described as having a first end <b>31</b>, a second end <b>32</b> and three segments <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. A first segment <b>35</b> extends between first end <b>31</b> and a first bend <b>33</b>. At least a portion of first segment <b>35</b> can preferably be inserted within opening <b>29</b>. In particular instances it can be preferable that opening <b>29</b> be of sufficient depth to allow an entirety of first segment <b>35</b> to be inserted into and housed within opening <b>29</b>, as depicted. The width of opening <b>29</b> can be such that a gap is present between material <b>12</b> and the keeper as shown, or can alternatively be provided such that minimal or no gap is present. It can be advantageous to provide opening <b>20</b> to have an opening size only slightly larger than the dimensions of segment <b>35</b> to allow stable retention of the keeper.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Second segment <b>36</b> extends from first bend <b>33</b> to a second bend <b>34</b> of the keeper. Second segment <b>36</b> preferably spans the distance between bore <b>20</b> and opening <b>29</b> allowing insertion of segment <b>36</b> into portion <b>28</b> of channel <b>26</b>. Although the depth of channel portion <b>28</b> is not limited to a particular value, it can be preferable that the depth of such channel portion is sufficient to allow keeper <b>30</b> to be housed within the channel such that second segment <b>36</b> does not extend beyond upper surface <b>18</b> of component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Third segment <b>37</b> of keeper <b>30</b> extends from second bend <b>34</b> to second end <b>32</b>. The lengths and relative lengths of segments <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are not limited to particular values. Preferably, the lengths of segments <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are such that keeper <b>30</b> is securely held within channel <b>26</b> and to function in assisting in retaining a spike within receiving region <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Keeper <b>30</b> can preferably be configured such that a first section of the keeper is housed within channel <b>26</b> while a second section extends into receiving region <b>22</b> in the absence of an inserted spike. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, segments <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and a portion of segment <b>37</b> comprise a first section of the keeper within channel <b>26</b> while the portion of segment <b>37</b> nearest second end <b>32</b> extends beyond sidewall <b>21</b> into receiving region <b>22</b>. Accordingly, as shown in top view <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the absence of a spike, keeper <b>30</b> can be seen to protrude beyond sidewall <b>21</b> into bore <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such depicts the retainer configuration described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> upon insertion of a spike <b>16</b> into the receiving region of bore <b>20</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depiction, spike <b>16</b> is a hollow type spike having sidewall surfaces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and specifically an inner sidewall surface <b>42</b> and an outer sidewall surface <b>40</b>. Upon insertion of spike <b>16</b> into bore <b>20</b>, segment <b>37</b> of keeper <b>30</b> retracts or substantially retracts into channel <b>26</b>. Keeper <b>30</b> is preferably configured such that an entirety or a portion of the length of segment <b>37</b> contacts outer sidewall <b>40</b> of spike <b>16</b> and exerts a force upon such outer sidewall contact region. Keeper <b>30</b> preferably comprises a material which allows sufficient force to be applied to the spike by segment <b>37</b> to allow spike <b>16</b> to be retained within bore <b>20</b> prior to tire puncturing while allowing removal of spike <b>16</b> by a punctured tire. Exemplary materials which can be utilized for keeper <b>30</b> include but are not limited to metallic materials, plastics, and composites. In particular instances keeper <b>30</b> can preferably comprise, consist essentially of or consist of a spring steel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular instances, keeper <b>30</b> can comprise a wire. Such wire can be, for example, round wire or flattened wire. In particular applications it can be beneficial to provide a flat type wire to allow an increased contact area between segment <b>37</b> and sidewall surface <b>40</b> of spike <b>16</b>. Such increased contact surface can allow enhanced tension between the keeper and the spike. However, the thickness and shape of keeper <b>30</b> will additionally depend upon the specific material utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although spike <b>16</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a hollow type spike, the invention additionally contemplates utilizing a solid (non-hollow) type spike for the retainer configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Whether hollow or solid type spikes are utilized, the invention contemplates utilization of two or more keepers <b>30</b> in association with each spike (not shown). In particular instances it can be preferable to use multiple keepers to provide increased tension between the keepers and the spike such that increased force is required to remove the spike. Accordingly, the spike retention force can be adjusted as desired for a particular device and/or application.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an alternative aspect of the invention is described relative to the configuration discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an alternative keeper configuration <b>30</b><i>a </i>is shown having a first segment <b>44</b> embedded into material <b>12</b> through base surface <b>24</b> of bore <b>20</b>. Keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>additionally comprises a second segment <b>45</b> which extends from surface <b>24</b> into the receiving region of bore <b>20</b>. Segment <b>45</b> can preferably comprise a bend <b>46</b> located at a distance from first end <b>31</b> to allow first end <b>31</b> to be spaced from sidewall <b>21</b> of opening <b>20</b> such that at least an uppermost portion of segment <b>45</b> extending from end <b>31</b> to bend <b>46</b> does not contact surface <b>21</b>. The spacing of first end <b>31</b> away from sidewall <b>21</b> can allow a hollow spike <b>16</b> to be easily inserted between keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>and sidewall <b>21</b> within the receiving region of bore <b>20</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, upon insertion of spike <b>16</b>, upper segment <b>45</b> of keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>is disposed within spike <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>is preferably configured to allow a portion of segment <b>45</b> comprising at least bend <b>46</b>, to contact an inner sidewall surface <b>42</b> of spike <b>16</b> and to exert force upon the sidewall region to thereby assist retention of spike <b>16</b> within bore <b>20</b>. Appropriate materials for keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>include any of the materials listed above with respect to keeper <b>30</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts segment <b>44</b> of keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>as being centrally disposed within base surface <b>24</b>, it is to be understood that the invention contemplates alternative positioning of segment <b>44</b> within base surface <b>24</b>. Additionally, the invention contemplates utilization of two or more keepers <b>30</b><i>a </i>within a single bore.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>as being utilized independently, keeper <b>30</b><i>a </i>can be utilized in addition to one or more keepers configured to contact the outer surface of a hollow spike. For example, the retainer configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> can be combined with the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> such that at least one keeper contacts an outer surface of spike <b>16</b> and at least one keeper contacts an inner surface of spike <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An additional spike retainer configuration in accordance with the invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, as shown bore <b>20</b> extends into material <b>12</b> from upper surface <b>18</b>. A channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>is provided which extends through base surface <b>24</b> across the width of bore <b>20</b> to provide a base portion <b>51</b> of channel <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>can further comprise a first lateral portion <b>50</b> extending from base portion <b>51</b> toward upper surface <b>18</b>. Lateral portion <b>50</b> can be described as extending from sidewall surface <b>21</b> of bore <b>20</b> into material <b>12</b>. A second lateral portion <b>52</b> of channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>can be provided opposing first lateral portion <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, channel portions <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can extend the entire depth of bore <b>20</b> through surface <b>18</b>. Alternatively, lateral portions <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can extend less than an entirety of the depth of bore <b>20</b> from base surface <b>24</b>. In particular applications it can be preferable that lateral portions <b>52</b> and <b>50</b> of channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>extend less than the entire distance to surface <b>18</b> to provide an increased tension between an appropriate keeper and an inserted spike (discussed below). A top view of the retainer configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Viewed from the top, channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>can be seen to traverse base surface <b>24</b> and extend outwardly through surface <b>21</b> on opposing sides of bore <b>20</b>. Although channel <b>26</b> is shown to traverse base surface <b>24</b> in a direction substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of component <b>12</b>, it is to be understood that the directionality of such channel is not limited and that the invention contemplates alternative directions of traversal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a keeper configuration <b>30</b><i>b </i>is shown. Keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be described as comprising a first lateral segment <b>54</b> comprising a first bend <b>55</b> disposed at first distance above base surface <b>24</b> of opening bore <b>20</b>. Keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>additionally comprises a second lateral segment <b>56</b> which has a second bend <b>57</b> disposed at a second distance above base surface <b>24</b>. Although bends <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> are shown as being disposed at substantially equivalent distances from surface <b>24</b>, the invention additionally contemplates configurations where one of bends <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> is closer to surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>additionally comprises a base segment extending between first and second lateral segments <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. Although base portion <b>51</b> of channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>is shown as having sufficient depth to allow an entirety of base segment <b>58</b> of keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>to be housed beneath surface <b>24</b> within channel <b>26</b><i>b </i>it is to be understood that the invention contemplates a shallower base channel portion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>can preferably be configured such that at least a portion of each of lateral segments <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> extend beyond surface <b>21</b> into spike receiving region <b>22</b> of bore <b>20</b> prior to insertion of a spike. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, insertion of spike <b>16</b> into bore <b>20</b> can preferably retract at least a portion of each lateral segment <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> into the lateral portions of channel <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Preferably a portion of each lateral segment <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> comprising at least respective bend <b>55</b>, <b>57</b> contacts outer surface <b>40</b> of spike <b>16</b>. Keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>is preferably configured to exert force on spike <b>16</b> to assist in retaining the spike within the bore at least until sufficient counterforce is exerted to overcome the tension between the keeper and the spike. Appropriate materials for keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be, for example, any of the materials described above with respect to keepers <b>30</b> and <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>is shown as being utilized independently, the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can be combined with one or more additional keeper configurations such as either of the two configurations discussed above. Additionally, the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can be adapted to allow two or more keepers having the configuration of keeper <b>30</b><i>b </i>to be utilized within a single bore.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reversible retainer configurations described above can advantageously allow spike to be full seated within the bore without obstruction by more bulky types of retaining components such as grommets. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, spike <b>16</b> can be inserted to contact base surface <b>24</b>. Although the configurations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show spike <b>16</b> being spaced from base surface <b>24</b>, it is to be understood that these configurations can also allow the spike to be positioned to contact the base surface. The invention contemplates utilization any of the described keepers and retainer configurations with the spike fully inserted and contacting the base surface of the bore to enhance spike stability. It is, however, to be understood that each of the described configurations can functionally reversibly retain the spike even in the event that the spike is not fully inserted or does not directly contact the base surface.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Methodology of the invention includes forming tire deflation devices and/or components to comprise one or more of the retainer configurations described above. Methodology of the invention can in some instances comprise methods of reversibly retaining a spike by providing a bore into a material such as a rotatable shaft or other component into which a spike is to be inserted. A channel can be provided through a sidewall of the bore and a keeper can be positioned such that a first segment of the keeper is housed within the channel while a second portion of the keeper extends into the bore as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A spike can be inserted into the bore such that insertion retracts at least a portion of the keeper into the channel. In particular instances a single keeper will be utilized per spike. In other configurations two or more keepers can be utilized to provide additional force on a spike. The force exerted on a given spike by the keeper(s) can preferably be overcome by force exerted on the spike by a tire upon insertion or puncturing of the tire by the spike allowing the spike to be withdrawn from the bore to remain inserted within the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, spike retention methodology of the invention can comprise inserting or otherwise providing a segment of a keeper through a base surface of the bore into which the spike is to be reversibly retained. A second segment of the inserted keeper is disposed within the bore such that upon insertion of a hollow spike, at least a portion of the keeper is within the hollow spike.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In particular applications, methodology of the invention can comprise providing at least one keeper configured to contact an inner surface of a hollow spike and at least one keeper configured to contact an outer surface of the spike. Methodology of the invention can further comprise adapting the retainer configurations presented above to be utilized for a particular deflation device and/or spike configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A tire deflation device in accordance with the invention can comprise at least one component having one or more of the spike retainer configurations described above. In particular instances a device in accordance with the invention will comprise the exemplary rotatable shaft device configuration as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Alternatively, a device in accordance with the invention can be an alternative device configuration to which the spike retainer configurations of the invention have been adapted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention contemplates adaptation of the retainer configurations of the invention to be utilized for reversibly retaining spikes in any tire deflation device where reversible spike retention is desired. It is to be understood that the invention further contemplates adaptation and utilization of the described retainer configurations for reversibly retaining spikes, pegs, rods, or other insertable components into bores, holes, or other openings within devices other than tire deflation devices. The number, type and materials of the keepers of the invention can be determined or adjusted based upon the desired disengagement force for removal of the insertable component.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
