<heading id="h-0001" level="1">IDENTIFICATION OF RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is related to co-pending and concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/140,886, entitled &#x201c;Snow Plow Blade Including Nut Retaining Plate&#x201d; which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, and which patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to snow plow blades, and particularly to removable wings or end extensions for snow plow blades used with a snow removal system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To move and remove snow and other road debris, a snow plow must be designed to withstand vibration, debris and heavy snow impact, exposure to salt and UV radiation and other rugged environmental conditions over its operating lifetime. Snow plow vehicles depend on the particular plowing application, and can include medium or light duty trucks, a skid or front-end loaders or commercial/government vehicles. A snow plow blade is mounted to the front of the plowing vehicle and has a generally curvilinear shape, to roll the snow upwardly from the bottom and then move it transversely across the face of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In its simplest form, a typical snow plow blade includes a support frame, having a substantially arcuate or curved overall cross-section, and a skin or moldboard, also having an arcuate cross-section. The rear side of the snow plow blade is hitched or otherwise attached to the plowing vehicle. The moldboard is secured to the front of the frame and includes a front surface that directly contacts and moves the snow during operation of the snow plow. A wearstrip or cutting edge is also secured to the front side of the frame near the bottom edge of the moldboard, which is the surface that contacts the ground during plowing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Snow plow blades come in may different types and sizes, depending on the particular plowing application. One type of snow plow design includes a straight, single snow plow blade. This type of blade can be operated in a straight position or can be pivoted left or right about a central axis to push snow to either side of the vehicle. However, a plow with a straight blade has difficulty in pushing a mound of snow to an out of the way location because snow spills out the sides of the plow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another type of snow plow design is referred to as an &#x201c;apex type&#x201d; plow blade, &#x201c;articulated plow blade&#x201d; or a &#x201c;V-plow&#x201d; because the hinge is at the apex of the V formed when the wings or blades of the plow are in a swept back position). The snow plow blades of a V-plow can be individually positioned into any configuration&#x2014;allowing the snow to be pushed to either side of the snow plow. Like a straight blade design, an articulated snow plow has a difficult time moving large mounds of snow because snow tends to spill over the far ends of each of the wing blades.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to improve the efficiency of a snow plow system, providing an end extension to increase the width or plowing productivity of a snow plow blade have been attempted. Prior art end extensions for snow plow blades typically require a significant amount of effort and mechanical modification, such as drilling or welding of the blade frame, to safely and securely mount an end extension to a snow plow blade. As such, prior art end extensions, if provided, are constructed to be permanent/semi-permanent additions to the snow plow blade. If the end extensions are removed for a given application, the extensions are stored apart from the snow plow blade, making a quick change to an extended blade inconvenient and time consuming.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disadvantages and limitations of the background art discussed above are overcome by the present invention. With this invention, a snow removal system including a snow plow blade and removably securable and storable end extensions are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The snow plow blade has a front, plowing side, and a rear side that will be secured to the plow vehicle. In its simplest form, the snow plow blade includes a support frame having a substantially arcuate overall cross-section, a moldboard and a cutting edge or wearstrip secured near the bottom of the support frame. The snow plow blade is configured to receive and store first and second removable wing extensions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A bottom member of the support frame is constructed of a three sided channel member including a channel top, and front and rear legs which angle downward and outward from the channel top. The front leg of the bottom frame member includes a plurality of evenly spaced apertures for mounting the wearstrip when the snow plow blade is assembled. A nut holder or retaining bar is secured to the inside surface of the front leg. The nut retaining bar includes also plurality of apertures formed therein, which are spaced to substantially axially align with the apertures formed in the front leg of the bottom frame member of the snow plow blade.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The apertures in the nut retaining bar are preferably oval or oblong in shape, and are sized to accommodate a hex nut. Importantly, each aperture in the nut retaining bar is sized to receive at least a portion of the nut but is not large enough for the nut to be turned in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction once positioned inside the aperture, preventing movement of the nut therein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, when the support frame of the snow plow blade is assembled using the nut retaining bar of the present invention, the wearstrip can be bolted to the support frame from the plowing or front side of the support frame. To do this, each bolt used to secure the wearstrip in place is inserted consecutively through an aperture in the wearstrip, a corresponding aperture in the moldboard, a corresponding aperture in the bottom frame member and a corresponding aperture in the nut retaining bar. A nut, which is positioned inside each of the apertures in the nut retaining bar, is then threaded on to the bolt. Because the nut cannot be turned or rotated inside the aperture of the nut retaining bar, each of the bolts can be tightened from the front of the snow plow blade, without the problem of the nut spinning, turning or coming loose, and without the need for a second individual to hold the nut in place during installation and removal of the wearstrip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also provides, removable snow plow wing extensions and snow plow blades configured to store and removably secure end extensions to one or both side ends of a snow plow blade. As such, a pair of wing extensions constructed in accordance with the present invention are configured in substantially the same manner; but are mirror images of each other, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A wing or end extension of the present invention, in its simplest form, includes a wing frame, a moldboard section secured to the front side of the wing frame and a wing cutting edge or wearstrip secured to a bottom edge of the moldboard section. The wing frame comprises a top member provided, at least in part, to retain or secure the top edge of the moldboard section in place, a bottom member provided, at least in part, to retain or secure the moldboard section and/or the wearstrip in place, vertical side members, and an attachment mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The attachment mechanism includes an attachment bracket configured to mount tubular attachment arms thereto. The attachment arms are sized to be removably received into apertures provided within the rear side of the main snow plow frame when the extensions are in the operational position, and are configured to be retained in a wing storage bracket, also secured to the rear side of the main snow plow frame, when the wing extension is not needed during operation of the snow plow.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The snow plow blade and removable wings of the present invention are of a construction which is both durable and long lasting, and which will require little or no maintenance to be provided by the user throughout its operating lifetime. The snow plow blade and removable wings of the present invention are also of inexpensive construction to enhance its market appeal and to thereby afford it the broadest possible market. Finally, all of the aforesaid advantages and objectives are achieved without incurring any substantial relative disadvantage.</p>

Accordingly, the front surface <b>66</b> comprises a clip, retainer plate or other fastening mechanism <b>80</b>, and/or can include a plurality of apertures or holes (not shown) between the ends <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> thereof for removably securing the top edge <b>45</b> of the moldboard <b>42</b> to the support frame <b>40</b> with bolts or screws.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The top surface <b>68</b> of the top member <b>44</b> includes a plurality of apertures or holes <b>82</b> positioned between the ends <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> thereof for mounting additional accessories to the snow plow blade <b>30</b>, such as a snow deflector. The apertures <b>82</b> may be pre-drilled in the top surface <b>68</b>, or may be provided at the time of installation of the accessory. It will be appreciated that the top member <b>44</b> can be a hollow member, a solid member, a channel member, or any type of rigid structure capable securing the moldboard <b>42</b> in position at the top of the support frame <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 21</figref>, in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the bottom member <b>46</b> of the support frame <b>40</b> is constructed of a three sided channel member resembling a wide inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d;, having a channel top <b>90</b>, front and rear legs <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> which angle downward and outward from the channel top <b>90</b>. The bottom member <b>46</b> also has first and second side ends <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. A plurality of reinforcing members <b>100</b> are evenly spaced along the length of the bottom member <b>46</b> between the side ends <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> thereof. The reinforcing members <b>100</b> are mounted to the channel top <b>90</b> and span from the front leg <b>92</b> to the rear leg <b>94</b> and are secured at each respective end thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rear leg <b>94</b> of the bottom horizontal member <b>46</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>102</b>. The apertures <b>102</b> are substantially equally spaced in the longitudinal direction along the rear leg <b>94</b> of the bottom horizontal member <b>46</b> and are linearly arranged with respect to each other. The apertures <b>102</b> are provided for securing a rear scraper (not shown) to the support frame <b>40</b> of the snow plow blade <b>30</b>, if desired. The apertures <b>102</b> may be pre-drilled, or may be provided at the time of installation of the rear scraper.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The front leg <b>92</b> of the bottom horizontal member <b>46</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>104</b>. The apertures <b>104</b> are substantially equally spaced in the longitudinal direction along the front leg <b>92</b> of the bottom horizontal member <b>44</b> and are linearly arranged with respect to each other. Preferably, there are ten apertures <b>104</b>. Each of the apertures <b>104</b> has a diameter <b>106</b> sized to accept a bolt <b>108</b> or other fastening mechanism to secure the moldboard <b>43</b> thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the nut plate or bar <b>110</b> is secured to an inside surface <b>112</b> of the front leg <b>92</b>. The nut plate <b>110</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>114</b> formed in a substantially equally spaced manner along the length thereof. There are preferably ten apertures <b>114</b> in the nut plate <b>110</b>, spaced to substantially axially align with the apertures <b>104</b> in the front leg <b>92</b> of the bottom member <b>46</b> of the snow plow blade <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each aperture <b>114</b> has a side wall <b>115</b> and is of a diameter <b>116</b> larger than the diameter <b>106</b> of the apertures <b>104</b> on the bottom member <b>46</b>. Each of the apertures <b>114</b> are preferably oval or oblong in shape, and are sized to accommodate a nut <b>118</b>. Importantly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>, each aperture <b>114</b> is sized to receive the nut <b>118</b>, but is not large enough for the nut <b>118</b> to be turned in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction once positioned inside the aperture <b>114</b>, as described in more detail below. As such, at least a portion of the outer edges <b>120</b> of the nut <b>118</b> contact the side walls <b>115</b> of the aperture <b>114</b>, preventing the movement thereof, when the nut <b>118</b> is positioned therein. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, it will be appreciated that the apertures <b>114</b> are deep enough to accommodate at least a portion of the width <b>122</b> of the nut <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the vertical side member <b>48</b> of the support frame <b>40</b> includes upper and lower openings, indicated generally at <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Like the wing bracket <b>139</b>, the wing bracket <b>139</b> is removably secured to the snow plow support frame <b>40</b> by threading a bolt through the aperture <b>174</b> on the vertical side member <b>50</b> and then through the aperture <b>193</b> in the tab <b>191</b> and securing it with a nut. Likewise, a second bolt is threaded through the aperture <b>180</b> on the rib <b>60</b> and then through the aperture <b>194</b> in the tab <b>192</b> and then it is secured with a nut.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additional elements, such as brackets <b>201</b> for mounting the hydraulic operating system or blade tripping system (not shown), bars <b>203</b> for securing a lighting accessory (not shown), and/or other mounting plates for securing support shoes can be incorporated into the support frame <b>40</b>, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To assemble the snow plow blade <b>30</b> of the present invention, the support frame <b>40</b> is permanently and securably assembled by welding or otherwise joining individual components as is well known to those skilled in the art. The top edge <b>45</b> of the moldboard <b>42</b> is secured to the top member <b>44</b> using the fastening mechanism <b>80</b>, or by any means known to those skilled in the art. Consistent with the broader aspects of the present invention, the moldboard may be welded or otherwise permanently secured in place, depending on the end-use application of the plow.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, apertures <b>204</b> are provided in near the bottom edge of the moldboard <b>42</b> and are formed in a substantially equally spaced manner along the length thereof. There are preferably ten apertures <b>204</b> in the moldboard <b>42</b>, which are configured to align with the apertures <b>104</b> in the front leg <b>92</b> of the bottom member <b>46</b>, and in turn, are configured to align with the apertures <b>114</b> in the nut plate <b>110</b>. When the moldboard <b>42</b> is installed on the support frame <b>40</b>, the apertures <b>204</b> in the bottom edge of the moldboard <b>42</b> should be in a properly aligned position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Likewise, apertures <b>206</b> are also provided in the wearstrip <b>43</b>, which are formed in a substantially equally spaced manner along the length thereof. There are preferably ten apertures <b>206</b> in the wearstrip <b>43</b>, which are configured to align with the apertures <b>204</b> in the moldboard <b>42</b>, the apertures <b>104</b> in the front leg <b>92</b> of the bottom member <b>46</b>, and in turn, are configured to align with the aperture <b>114</b> in the nut plate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once the moldboard <b>42</b> is installed and properly positioned so that its apertures <b>204</b> are aligned with the apertures <b>104</b> in the bottom member <b>46</b>, the wearstrip <b>43</b> is positioned adjacent to the moldboard <b>42</b> so that its apertures <b>206</b> are aligned with the apertures <b>204</b> in the moldboard <b>42</b>. Each of the bolts <b>108</b> is then inserted consecutively through the aperture <b>206</b> in the wearstrip <b>43</b>, the aperture <b>204</b> in the moldboard <b>42</b>, the aperture <b>104</b> in the bottom member <b>46</b> and the aperture <b>104</b> in the nut plate <b>110</b>. Each nut <b>118</b> is partially threaded by hand or otherwise on to the bolt <b>108</b> at least until the nut is partially positioned inside the aperture <b>104</b> in the nut plate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Because the nut <b>118</b> cannot be turned or rotated inside the aperture <b>114</b> of the nut plate <b>110</b>, the bolt <b>108</b> is tightened from the front plowing side <b>34</b> of the snow plow blade <b>30</b>, without the problem of the nut <b>118</b> spinning, turning or coming loose, and without the need for a second individual to hold the nut <b>118</b> in place during installation and removal of the wearstrip <b>43</b>. Accordingly, the wearstrip <b>43</b> is easily secured to the support frame <b>40</b> of the snow plow blade <b>30</b> from the front plowing side <b>34</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 11</figref>, in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the removable snow plow wing extensions <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> will now be described. It will be appreciated that the wing extensions <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> are mirror images of each other, and are therefore constructed in substantially the same manner.
