<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a hollow core door having a perimeter frame and a pair of reverse molded wood composite door skins having an exterior surface and an interior surface secured to opposing sides of the frame. At least one of the skins has an outer planar area, an inner planar area, and an asymmetric profile surrounding the inner planar area, and interconnecting and integral with the outer planar area and the inner planar area. The asymmetric profile area has a convex portion extending outwardly from and relative to the plane of the outer planar area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Man-made boards, such as fiberboard, e.g., medium density fiberboard; hardboard; chipboard; oriented strand board-fiberboard composites; particle board; oriented strand board-particle board composites; and the like, may be formed into articles having contoured portions simulating stiles, rails, panels, or other desired features. Such articles may be formed to include one or more interior depressions or raised contours simulating panels or other decorative features. Such formed depressions and contoured portions may replicate a natural wood paneled door.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With respect to conventional doors, molded door skins may be adhesively secured to a wood frame support structure to produce a finished door. Rails and stiles may also be used to provide additional structural support for the door. Such doors are well known in the art, and provide consumers with an aesthetically appealing, yet cost efficient alternative to traditional, solid wood doors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,055 to Crittenden discloses an asymmetrically formed door and a method of making the door. The asymmetry allows the door portion inwardly from its perimeter frame to warp in response to temperature and humidity conditions without warping the perimeter frame. Accordingly, the door perimeter frame remains in its original planar configuration. The disclosed door comprises a pair of asymmetrically configured skins secured to a perimeter frame, with a foam disposed between the skins. Generally, the door is used as an exterior door. U.S. Pat. No. 5,074,087 to Green discloses a door having a composite construction with a conventional perimeter frame and a pair of molded fiberglass skins secured to the perimeter frame. Within the skins and the perimeter frame is a plastic foam core. U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,808 to Costello discloses a door having a perimeter frame, which is sandwiched between formed metal stampings or body panels. Wood panels or veneers may then be adhesively secured to the metal stampings to provide a wood appearance. Several different exterior configurations are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a door comprising a conventional perimeter frame and a pair of reverse molded wood composite skins. The molded skins include asymmetrical configurations and fill elements between selected portions of the skins. The fill portions are disposed adjacent to the asymmetrical elements so as not to interfere with any warping of the asymmetrical elements due to temperature or humidity conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a hollow core door comprising a perimeter frame, and first and second reverse molded door skins. Each of the skins has an exterior surface and an interior surface secured to opposing sides of the frame. At least one of the skins has an outer planar area, an inner planar area, and an asymmetric profile surrounding the inner planar area and interconnecting and integral with the outer planar area and the inner planar area. The asymmetric profile area has a convex portion extending outwardly from and relative to the plane of the outer planar area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is also directed to a molded door skin comprising an outer planar area, an inner planar area, and an asymmetric profile area surrounding the inner planar area and interconnecting and integral with the outer planar area and the inner planar area. The asymmetric profile area has a convex portion extending outwardly from and relative to the plane of the outer planar area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A double skin door apparatus is provided, comprising a door frame having opposing sides. A first door skin is secured to one side of the frame. The first door skin has a first asymmetrical profile including a convex portion and a concave portion. A second door skin is secured to an opposing side of the frame, and is spaced from the first door skin. The second door skin has a second asymmetrical profile including a convex portion and a concave portion. The convex portions of the first and second door skins define a first distance, and the concave portions of the first and second door skins define a second distance, wherein the first distance is greater than the second distance. A plate is disposed between the first and second door skins.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A door comprises a perimeter frame having a first face and a second face. The frame has a first width. A first skin having a perimeter planar portion is secured to the first face of the frame. The first skin has an upper convex portion and an upper inner planar portion, a lower convex portion and a lower inner planar portion spaced from the upper convex portion and the upper inner planar portion. A second skin has a perimeter planar portion secured to the second face of the frame. The second skin has an upper convex portion and an upper inner planar portion, a lower convex portion and a lower inner planar portion spaced from the upper convex portion and the upper inner planar portion on the second skin. The upper convex portions of the first and second skins and the inner planar portions of the first and second skins are aligned with each other. Preferably the door skins are molded from a wood composite, such as medium density fiberboard, chip board, flake board, oriented strand board, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Objects of the present invention include the following: to provide a new and useful door apparatus; to provide a new and useful interior door apparatus; to provide a new and useful door apparatus having a pair of exterior skins secured to a perimeter frame; to provide a new and useful door having a pair of asymmetrically configured outer skins secured to a frame; to provide a new and useful door apparatus including a pair of asymmetrically configured outer skins secured to a perimeter frame in a mirror image orientation; and to provide a new and useful door apparatus having a pair of outer skins having asymmetrical elements secured to a perimeter frame and plates secured to the skins and disposed inwardly adjacent to the asymmetrical elements.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a door <b>10</b> comprises a perimeter frame <b>12</b>, frame <b>12</b> having a pair of stiles <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and a pair of rails <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Rail <b>20</b> is disposed near the top of door <b>10</b>, and rail <b>18</b> is disposed near the bottom of door <b>10</b>. Stiles <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and rails <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are appropriately secured together to define frame <b>12</b> of door <b>10</b>. Frame <b>12</b> may also include an intermediate rail <b>22</b> disposed intermediate rails <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and extending fully between stiles <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Preferably, intermediate rail <b>22</b> extends parallel to top and bottom rails <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. As well known in the art, a handle set (not shown) may be secured to door <b>10</b> at intermediate rail <b>22</b>. Rail <b>22</b> allows door <b>10</b> to be hung as either a right hand or a left hand door. Since rail <b>22</b> extends fully between stiles <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, a handle set may be secured to door <b>10</b> adjacent either stile <b>14</b> or stile <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, stiles <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, rails <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and intermediate rail <b>22</b> are made of wood or wood product. Door <b>10</b> is particularly well suited as an interior door, and may be referred to as a hollow core door. Door <b>10</b> further comprises two skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>. Each of skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> has an exterior visible surface <b>31</b>, <b>51</b> and an interior surface <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> for securing to opposite sides of frame <b>12</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> may be secured to frame <b>12</b> so that they are mirror images of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Skin <b>30</b> includes an outer planar area <b>32</b>. Inwardly from outer planar area <b>32</b> is an asymmetrical profile P formed in skin <b>30</b>. Asymmetrical profile P includes a convex portion <b>34</b> and a concave portion <b>36</b>. The particular configuration of convex portion <b>34</b> and concave portion <b>36</b> may vary depending on consumer preference. Inwardly from concave portion <b>36</b> is an inner planar area <b>38</b>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the planar areas <b>32</b> and <b>38</b> have a thickness exceeding the thickness of concave portion <b>34</b> and convex portion <b>38</b>. Therefore, inner planar area <b>38</b> is disposed within the perimeter of asymmetrical profile P and is inwardly spaced relative to planar portion <b>32</b>. That is, asymmetrical profile P comprises a closed area relative to exterior surface <b>31</b>. This closed area may be either regular or irregular, depending on consumer preference. For example, asymmetrical profile P may define a rectangular closed area, or asymmetrical profile P may define a closed area having a curved side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In either case, asymmetrical profile P defines a continuous or closed loop, with inner planar area <b>38</b> disposed within the closed loop.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Door <b>10</b> may include more than one asymmetrical profile portion P. For example, door <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes asymmetrical profile P defined by convex portion <b>34</b> and concave portion <b>36</b>, as described above. Asymmetrical profile P is disposed in an upper portion of door <b>10</b>, preferably above intermediate rail <b>22</b> and below rail <b>20</b>. In addition, door <b>10</b> includes a second asymmetrical profile portion P<b>2</b> disposed below intermediate rail <b>22</b> and above rail <b>18</b>. Asymmetrical profile portion P<b>2</b> may have a different closed loop configuration and shape compared to asymmetrical profile portion P. Asymmetrical profile P<b>2</b> is defined by a lower convex portion <b>40</b> and a lower concave portion <b>42</b>. Inwardly from lower concave portion <b>42</b> is a lower planar portion <b>44</b>. Thus, lower asymmetric profile P<b>2</b> also comprises a closed loop, with convex portion <b>40</b> and concave portion <b>42</b> comprising continuous elements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The particular configuration of asymmetric profiles P, P<b>2</b>, or their connecting elements, may vary from that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depending on consumer preference. While lower asymmetric profile P<b>2</b> is shown as a square or a rectangle, upper asymmetric profile P is shown as an irregular shape with three straight sides and a curved side. It should be understood that any configuration or shape of an asymmetric profile may be formed in door skin <b>30</b>. Furthermore, skin <b>30</b> may include any number of asymmetric profiles, thereby simulating multi-panel doors. In addition, skin <b>30</b> may include a wood grain pattern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As well known in the art, a wood grain pattern may be embossed or formed in skin <b>30</b>, or a veneer or paper overlay may be secured to exterior surface <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Skin <b>50</b> is substantially identical to skin <b>30</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, skin <b>50</b> includes an outer planar portion <b>52</b>, an upper convex portion <b>54</b>, an upper concave portion <b>56</b>, and an upper inner planar portion <b>58</b> within an asymmetric profile defined by the convex portion <b>54</b> and the concave portion <b>56</b> and their connecting elements. The other portions of skin <b>50</b> may be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that skin <b>50</b> is essentially a mirror image of skin <b>30</b>. Thus, skin <b>50</b> may also include any configuration or shape of asymmetric profiles, but preferably corresponds to the configurations formed in skin <b>30</b> so that convex and concave portions of skin <b>30</b> are aligned with convex and concave portions of skin <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The use of double skins, with the skins being mirror images of each other, and both including asymmetric elements, provides a door that is stable under virtually all conditions of temperature and humidity, and is also aesthetically pleasing for consumers. Specifically, the asymmetry allows the portion of door <b>10</b> that is disposed inwardly from frame <b>12</b> to warp in response to temperature and humidity conditions without warping frame <b>12</b>. In this way, frame <b>12</b> remains in its original planar configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> are secured to opposing sides of frame <b>12</b> at the interior surface <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> of outer planar areas <b>32</b>, <b>52</b>, respectively, and to the interior surface <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> corresponding to an intermediate rail (or lock rail) <b>22</b>. Skins <b>30</b> and <b>50</b> are preferably molded from a wood composite, such as medium density fiberboard. The skins <b>30</b> and <b>50</b> preferably are identical. In one embodiment of the present invention, a plate element <b>70</b> is disposed between and secured to interior surface <b>33</b> of inner planar portions <b>38</b>, <b>58</b> of skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, respectively, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Plate element <b>70</b> provides stability to skins <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> without hindering the warping of asymmetric profile P adjacent to the plate element <b>70</b>. A second plate element <b>70</b> may also be disposed between and secured to interior surface <b>33</b> of lower inner planar portion <b>44</b> and the corresponding lower inner planar portion on skin <b>50</b>. The asymmetric profiles P, P<b>2</b> may warp in response to temperature and humidity conditions without affecting either perimeter frame <b>12</b> or inner planar portions <b>38</b>, <b>58</b> with their plate elements. And likewise, inner planar portions <b>38</b>, <b>58</b> with plates <b>70</b> secured to them, do not affect the warping of the asymmetric elements. Plates <b>70</b> provide additional strength and stability to door <b>10</b>, regardless of the temperature and humidity conditions of the structure in which the door is installed. Plates <b>70</b> are formed from wood, wood composite, foam and like materials used to form a door core. The plate <b>70</b> is preferably adhesively secured to the adjacent door skins.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, perimeter frame <b>12</b> has a predetermined width or thickness, and the distance between convex portion <b>34</b> and convex portion <b>54</b>, shown by arrow d<b>1</b>, is greater than the width of perimeter frame <b>12</b>, shown by arrow d<b>2</b>. The distance between concave portions <b>36</b> and <b>56</b>, shown by arrow d<b>3</b>, is less than the width of perimeter frame <b>12</b>. The distance between inner planar portion <b>38</b> and inner planar portion <b>58</b> (with plate <b>70</b> disposed between them), shown by arrow d<b>4</b>, is less than the distance between convex portions <b>34</b> and <b>54</b> (d<b>1</b>), but is greater than the distance between concave portions <b>36</b> and <b>56</b> (d<b>3</b>). Also, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the plate <b>70</b> secured to skins <b>30</b> and <b>50</b> is longitudinally spaced from rail <b>14</b>, thus providing a hollow space encompassing planar portions <b>32</b>, convex portions <b>34</b>, and concave portions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, the caliper of skin <b>30</b> at convex portion <b>34</b> is less than the caliper of skin <b>30</b> at outer planar area <b>32</b> or inner planar area <b>38</b>. Convex portion <b>34</b> extends outwardly beyond the plane of outer planar area <b>32</b> relative to exterior surface <b>31</b>. Concave portion <b>36</b> extends inwardly from the plane of outer planar area <b>32</b> relative to exterior surface <b>31</b>. Inner planar area <b>38</b> lies on a plane spaced from the plane of outer planar area <b>32</b>, and is preferably recessed from outer planar area <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Concave portion <b>36</b> may also extend inwardly from the plane of inner planar area <b>38</b>, creating a relatively small distance d<b>3</b> between concave portions <b>36</b>, <b>56</b>, as noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Similarly, the caliper of skin <b>50</b> at convex portion <b>54</b> is less than the caliper of skin <b>50</b> at outer planar area <b>52</b> or inner planar area <b>58</b>. Convex portion <b>54</b> extends outwardly beyond the plane of outer planar area <b>52</b> relative to exterior surface <b>51</b>. Concave portion <b>56</b> extends inwardly from the plane of outer planar area <b>52</b> relative to exterior surface <b>51</b>. Inner planar area <b>58</b> lies on a plane spaced from the plane of outer planar area <b>52</b>, and is preferably recessed from outer planar area <b>52</b>. Concave portion <b>56</b> may also extend inwardly from the plane of inner planar area <b>58</b>, as with concave portion <b>36</b> and thereby defining distance d<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The configuration and alignment of the lower asymmetric profile P<b>2</b>, with respect to the convex and concave portions, is substantially the same as that discussed above for the upper asymmetric profile P with respective convex and concave portions, and the inner planar portion with its plate, aligned accordingly. It should be understood that the configuration of lower asymmetric profile P<b>2</b> may vary depending on consumer preference.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second embodiment of the present invention provides for a door <b>110</b> having a perimeter frame <b>112</b>, and a plurality of upper asymmetric elements <b>134</b>, <b>144</b> and inner planar elements <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, a plurality of intermediate asymmetric elements <b>154</b>, <b>164</b> and inner planar elements <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>, and a plurality of lower asymmetric elements <b>174</b>, <b>184</b> and inner planar elements <b>180</b>, <b>190</b>. Perimeter frame <b>112</b> includes a pair of vertical stiles <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and a pair of horizontal rails <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. Door <b>110</b> may also include an intermediate rail <b>122</b> extending between stiles <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and appropriately secured thereto. A pair of skins <b>130</b> are appropriately secured to opposing sides of perimeter frame <b>112</b> and to intermediate rail <b>122</b>, as described above for door <b>10</b>. Although only one skin <b>130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it should be understood that a second skin is secured to the opposite side of frame <b>112</b>, and is preferably a mirror image of skin <b>130</b> just as skin <b>50</b> is preferably a mirror image of skin <b>30</b> on door <b>10</b>. Each of skins <b>130</b> is manufactured from a molded wood composite, such as medium density fiberboard.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of skins <b>130</b> includes a perimeter planar area <b>132</b>, which may be secured to perimeter frame <b>112</b>. Skin <b>130</b> includes a pair of upper asymmetric profiles <b>134</b>, <b>144</b>, a pair of intermediate asymmetric profiles <b>154</b>, <b>164</b>, and a pair of lower asymmetric profiles <b>174</b>, <b>184</b>. Note that asymmetric profiles <b>134</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>174</b> and <b>184</b> may differ in size and shape. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, upper asymmetric profiles <b>134</b>, <b>144</b> are smaller than intermediate and lower asymmetric profiles <b>154</b>, <b>164</b>, and <b>174</b>, <b>184</b>, respectively. The differences in size and shape are for illustrative and explanatory purposes only, and are immaterial to the functionality of door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above for door <b>10</b>, each asymmetric profile on door <b>110</b> includes a closed loop convex portion integral with and connected to a closed loop concave portion. Each concave portion is disposed about an inner planar portion. For example, profile <b>134</b> includes a closed loop convex portion <b>136</b> connected to a closed loop concave portion <b>138</b>, and an enclosed inner planar portion <b>140</b>. Profile <b>144</b> includes a closed loop convex portion <b>146</b> connected to a closed loop concave portion <b>148</b>, and an enclosed inner planar portion <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Intermediate asymmetric profiles <b>154</b>, <b>164</b> include, respectively, closed loop convex portions <b>156</b>, <b>166</b>, integral with and connected to closed loop concave portions <b>158</b>, <b>168</b>, and enclosed inner planar portions <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>. Lower asymmetric profiles <b>174</b>, <b>184</b> include closed loop convex portions <b>176</b>, <b>186</b>, integral with and connected to closed loop concave portions <b>178</b>, <b>188</b>, and disposed about or enclosing inner planar portions <b>180</b>, <b>190</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the closed loop asymmetric profiles are of a generally elongated rectangular configuration. However, the profile configurations of door <b>110</b> may have any desired size and shape, depending on consumer preference. For example, the asymmetric profiles may be round, square, rectangular, irregular, or a combination of such shapes (as in asymmetric profile P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In order to allow for appropriate warping of door <b>110</b>, without distorting or warping perimeter frame <b>112</b>, the profiles need only be closed loop. Each profile includes a convex portion, a concave portion connected to the convex portion, and an enclosed inner planar portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the opposing skins <b>130</b> are secured to frame <b>112</b> so that skins <b>130</b> have a mirror image when viewed in cross-section (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for door <b>10</b>). Skins <b>130</b> are therefore secured to frame <b>112</b> in a similar manner as described above for door <b>10</b>. Furthermore, door <b>110</b> may also include plates secured between the pair of skins <b>130</b> between the enclosed inner planar portions <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> and corresponding inner planar portions of the other skin <b>130</b> securing to the opposing side of frame <b>112</b>, as discussed above. Furthermore, door <b>110</b> may also include a wood grain pattern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a third embodiment of the present invention provides for a door <b>210</b> having a lock block <b>222</b> secured to a stile <b>214</b>, as opposed to an intermediate rail or lock rail extending fully between the vertical stiles (as in doors <b>10</b> and <b>110</b>). A second lock block (not shown) may be secured to the opposing stile on the opposite side of door <b>210</b>. Except for the omission of an intermediate rail extending fully between opposing stiles, and the inclusion of at least one lock block <b>222</b>, the configuration of door <b>210</b> is identical to that described for doors <b>10</b> and <b>110</b>. With two lock blocks, door <b>210</b> may have a lock set secured on either side of door <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, door <b>210</b> includes a full perimeter frame <b>212</b>, which includes stile <b>214</b> to which block <b>222</b> is secured. A pair of outer skins <b>230</b>, <b>250</b> are secured to opposing sides of frame <b>212</b>. For purposes of discussion, skin <b>230</b> is a &#x201c;front&#x201d; skin, and skin <b>250</b> is a &#x201c;rear&#x201d; skin. Skins <b>230</b>, <b>250</b> are mirror images of each other, as discussed for doors <b>10</b> and <b>110</b>. Skin <b>230</b> includes an outer perimeter planar area or portion <b>232</b>, and skin <b>250</b> includes an outer perimeter planar area or portion <b>252</b>. Outer perimeter portions <b>232</b>, <b>252</b> are appropriately secured to frame <b>212</b> and to the lock block <b>222</b>, as well as a lock block opposite lock block <b>222</b> on the opposing stile (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The asymmetrical design or portion for skin <b>230</b> includes a convex portion <b>234</b> and a concave portion <b>236</b>, as described above. The asymmetrical design or profile for skin <b>250</b> includes a convex portion <b>254</b> and a concave portion <b>256</b>. The respective convex and concave portions of the skins are aligned with each other, as discussed above and as illustrated for the door <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The convex and concave portions extend continuously, without a break, for the full length of skins <b>230</b>, <b>250</b>, and are disposed inwardly from outer perimeter portions <b>232</b>, <b>252</b>, respectively. The convex and concave elements therefore provide relatively long closed loops compared to the shorter closed loops of doors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>. Without a transversely extending intermediate or lock rail, door <b>210</b> may have such full-length asymmetric portions in skins <b>230</b>, <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each skin <b>230</b>, <b>250</b> includes an inner planar area adjacent to concave portions of the skins, as described above. For example, skin <b>230</b> includes an inner planar portion <b>238</b> and skin <b>250</b> includes an inner planar portion <b>258</b>. A plate <b>270</b> may be secured between inner planar portions <b>238</b>, <b>258</b>. Plate <b>270</b> provides stability for door <b>210</b>, as explained above. Plate <b>270</b> may extend fully within the asymmetrical profile of door <b>210</b>, adjacent concave portions <b>236</b>, <b>256</b>, without restricting warping of the aligned asymmetrical portions in response to temperature and humidity conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Certain aspects of the present invention have been explained with respect to specific embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in construction or configuration of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Therefore, it is intended that the present invention cover all such modifications and variations, provided they come within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
