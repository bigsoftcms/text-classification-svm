<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A variety of drilling rigs are used in the formation and preparation of wellbores for production of well fluids or for other well related procedures. Drilling rigs have been designed to selectively drill using coiled tubing and jointed pipe. In one example, a rig includes a base, a mast and a tubing injector used to inject coiled tubing into the wellbore and to withdraw coiled tubing from the wellbore. The rig also includes a top drive mounted to the mast to perform a variety of drilling related operations.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The top drive is functional to provide drill stem rotation for both drilling and tool string make-up. The top drive also supports the rotating pipe load and provides a sealed swivel arrangement for conveying drilling fluid. Top drives can also be used to handle drill string components and to torque connections between drill string components. However, top drives are relatively expensive devices that have high hydraulic power requirements and pose substantial risk to the drilling operation in the event of top drive failure. The potential for top drive failure also is of concern, because top drives tend to be relatively complex devices that are required to provide rotational motion for a variety of tasks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the present invention provides a system and a methodology for drilling and coiled tubing operations in which the components are combined in a transportable vehicle. The system and methodology also provide a substantial amount of the functionality of a top drive without the expense and the complexity of top drives. The present technique utilizes a bed and a mast mounted to the bed. A coiled tubing injector is mounted to the mast to move coiled tubing into and out of the well. A starter head also is mounted to the mast to provide linear and rotational functionality that enables the manipulation, connection, and disconnection of tool string components.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention relates to a system and methodology for drilling operations and coiled tubing operations with a single rig. The combined coiled tubing and drilling rig is designed to avoid the use of a top drive or power swivel system, thereby reducing the hydraulic requirements, risk factors and cost factors of conventional coiled tubing drilling units. Generally, the system and methodology utilize a rig having a bed with a mast mounted to the bed. A coiled tubing spool also is rotatably mounted to the bed via a spindle, and a coiled tubing injector is mounted to the mast to facilitate coiled tubing operations. Additionally, a movable starter head is mounted to the mast to facilitate the making and breaking of connections between tool string components, e.g. bottom hole assembly components or other tool string components. The starter head does not power the actual drilling, but rather uses a smaller motor, such as an electric motor or a hydraulic motor, sized to impart rotational motion to the tool string components sufficient for the making, i.e. connecting, and breaking, i.e. disconnecting, of the tool string components. The power for actual drilling is provided by a downhole drill motor that is moved downhole into a wellbore with the drill string. The starter head typically does not rotate during drilling, and can be designed to counter the torque generated by the drilling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, a coiled tubing and drilling rig <b>20</b> is illustrated as comprising a bed <b>22</b>. By way of example, bed <b>22</b> may be formed as a trailer <b>24</b>, such as a truck trailer, supported by a plurality of wheels <b>26</b>. In this embodiment, bed <b>22</b> is designed for engagement with a motorized vehicle <b>28</b>, e.g. a tractor, to form a tractor-trailer vehicle that can be driven from one well site to another. In many embodiments, trailer <b>24</b> and motorized vehicle <b>28</b> are designed to be road legal, enabling transport of the coiled tubing and drilling equipment over public highway systems. It should be noted, however, that bed <b>22</b> can be constructed in other forms, including self-propelled forms that do not rely on a separate tractor for movement of the coiled tubing and drilling rig. Bed <b>22</b> also may comprise stabilizing equipment, such as a plurality of stabilizer legs <b>30</b> that can be selectively pressed against the ground surface to both level and stabilize bed <b>22</b> during drilling operations and coiled tubing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Coiled tubing and drilling rig <b>20</b> further comprises a mast <b>32</b> mounted to the bed <b>22</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, mast <b>32</b> is mounted to a structure <b>34</b> having a platform <b>36</b> on which is mounted a component support structure <b>38</b>, such as a rotary table. The component support structure <b>38</b> is designed to engage tool string components, such as tubing, by appropriate engagement mechanisms (not shown), e.g. slips, as are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The entire mast <b>32</b> can be pivotably mounted on a pivot member <b>40</b> to enable the mast to be pivoted downwardly to a storage position for transport to another well site. A hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b> can be used to move mast <b>32</b> between the storage position and an upright, operating position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> is mounted to mast <b>32</b> via a mounting structure <b>46</b>. Mounting structure <b>46</b> can be designed to provide a platform <b>48</b> on which coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> is movably mounted via a shuttle mechanism <b>50</b>. Shuttle mechanism <b>50</b> can be used to move coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> into and out of alignment with mast <b>32</b>, for example, depending on the type of drilling operation or coiled tubing operation being performed. The coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> also may comprise a lubricator <b>52</b> designed to guide a coiled tubing <b>54</b> out of coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> when coiled tubing is being deployed into a wellbore <b>56</b>. An injector arch <b>58</b> may be connected to or positioned above the upper side of coiled tubing injector <b>44</b>. The injector arch <b>58</b> is an arched structure that facilitates flexing of coiled tubing <b>54</b> and movement of coil tubing <b>54</b> into injector <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Coiled tubing and drilling rig <b>20</b> may further comprise a coiled tubing spool <b>60</b> rotatably mounted on bed <b>22</b>. Coiled tubing <b>54</b> is wrapped around spool <b>60</b> for delivery to coiled tubing injector <b>44</b>, as illustrated. During coiled tubing operations, spool <b>60</b> is selectively rotated about a spindle <b>61</b> to deliver coiled tubing <b>54</b> into wellbore <b>56</b> or to withdraw coiled tubing from the wellbore. The spool <b>60</b> can be rotated by a conventional coiled tubing spool motor. In one embodiment, power to rotate coiled tubing spool <b>60</b>, to extend and contract cylinder <b>42</b>, and to perform various other powered operations on rig <b>20</b> can be provided hydraulically via a hydraulic supply <b>62</b> and a power source <b>64</b> for pressurizing hydraulic fluid, e.g. an internal combustion engine and hydraulic pump.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A starter head <b>66</b> also is mounted to mast <b>32</b> for movement along the mast <b>32</b>. For example, starter head <b>66</b> can be lowered or raised along mast <b>32</b> by a mechanism <b>68</b> which can have a variety of forms depending on the specific application. For example, mechanism <b>68</b> may comprise a traveling block, a traveling block integrated into the mast, a rack and opinion system, a winch or other suitable mechanisms for mechanically raising and lowering starter head <b>66</b>. As will be explained in greater detail below, starter head <b>66</b> can be used in the assembly of tool string components, to support the pipe load, to provide a sealed swivel arrangement for conveying drilling fluid, to provide hydraulically manipulated elevators for moving tool string components, and to apply proper torque to the connections between tool string components, e.g. drill string components. The starter head <b>66</b> also may be mounted on an apparatus, such as platform <b>48</b> and shuttle mechanism <b>50</b>, to enable movement of starter head <b>66</b> off of the well center when necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During a coiled tubing operation, such as lowering a bottom hole assembly into wellbore <b>56</b>, coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> is moved into general alignment with mast <b>32</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> is moved via shuttle mechanism <b>50</b> which transfers the injector from an out-of-alignment position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, into general alignment with mast <b>32</b> and wellbore <b>56</b>. In this position, coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> can be operated to move coiled tubing <b>54</b> into position for engagement with tool string components, e.g. bottom hole assembly components, that are to be moved into the wellbore. In some applications, coiled tubing may be used in a drilling operation. In these applications, the coiled tubing injector is moved into alignment with the area in which the wellbore is to be formed. When switching from a coiled tubing operation to another operation, such as a jointed-pipe drilling operation, coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> can again be moved via shuttle mechanism <b>52</b> to an out-of-alignment position. It should be noted that in some applications, mounting structure <b>46</b> and coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> can be designed for movement along mast <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the starter head <b>66</b> is illustrated in a lowered position. The starter head <b>66</b> can be moved along mast <b>32</b>, as necessary, to perform a variety of drilling operations and coiled tubing operations. For example, starter head <b>66</b> can be used in the assembly of jointed pipe for a drilling operation. However, starter head <b>66</b> also can be used to facilitate a coiled tubing operation. For example, starter head <b>66</b> can be used to secure, lift, position, connect and torque connections between bottom hole assembly components that are subsequently coupled to coiled tubing <b>54</b> below coiled tubing injector <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An embodiment of starter head <b>66</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment, starter head <b>66</b> is coupled to the motion imparting mechanism <b>68</b> by an appropriate coupling structure <b>70</b>. As illustrated, one embodiment of coupling structure <b>70</b> comprises a pair of split sheaves. Starter head <b>66</b> also may comprise a mud line connection <b>72</b> coupled to a rotatable swivel <b>74</b> which may be designed to hold pressure while pumping material through mud line connection <b>72</b>. The rotatable swivel <b>74</b> may or may not be rated to hold pressure while rotating, depending on the particular applications in which starter head <b>66</b> is utilized. The lower portion of rotatable swivel <b>74</b> comprises a quill <b>76</b> used for connecting tool string components. For example, quill <b>76</b> may be used to connect components of a drilling bottom hole assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A mechanical apparatus <b>78</b> is used to rotate quill <b>76</b>, thereby enabling the formation or &#x201c;spinning up&#x201d; of a connection between tool string components. Mechanical apparatus <b>78</b> also enables proper application of torque to the connection once formed. By way of example, mechanical apparatus <b>78</b> comprises a gear <b>80</b> mounted to quill <b>76</b> and driven by a motor <b>82</b>. Motor <b>82</b> may be an electric motor or a hydraulic motor that is a relatively simple, low-power, low-cost, standard motor relative to that which would be required for a top drive. The much higher power required for drilling is supplied by a separate drill motor <b>84</b> that is moved downhole into wellbore <b>56</b> with a drill string <b>86</b>. Thus, the downhole drill motor <b>84</b> provides the power to turn a drill bit <b>88</b> completely independently of motor <b>82</b> which greatly increases the reliability, simplifies the construction, and lowers the cost of starter head <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Starter head <b>66</b> may also comprise a stem <b>90</b>, such as a drill stem, that can be used to engage components being connected or disconnected. Additionally, a hydraulic backup <b>92</b> can be used to prevent the tool string components, such as the bottom hole assembly components, from rotating when component connections or disconnections are made. The backup device also can be used to lock quill <b>76</b> and prevent rotation of quill <b>76</b> during drilling operations with downhole drill motor <b>84</b>. To further prevent rotation of starter head components during drilling operations, and anti-rotation mechanism <b>93</b>, such as one or more torque bars, can be positioned between starter head <b>66</b> and an adjacent structure, such as mast <b>32</b>, to prevent unwanted rotation due to torque transferred through drill string <b>86</b> during drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The starter head <b>66</b> also may comprise elevators <b>94</b> that can be used to handle tool string components. For example, elevators <b>94</b> can be used to handle bottom hole assembly components during &#x201c;make-up&#x201d; or &#x201c;break-out&#x201d; operations. Depending on the application, elevators <b>94</b> may be formed as powered elevators. Powered elevators have the ability to open and closed remotely. The elevators <b>94</b> also can incorporate hydraulic rams <b>96</b> constructed to control the position of bails supporting elevators <b>94</b>. This provides the elevators with greater positioning ability for properly aligning tool string components during installation or removal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An example of the use of starter head <b>66</b> and elevators <b>94</b> for coupling components is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Initially, starter head <b>66</b> is moved toward the bottom of mast <b>32</b> to enable the securing of a tool string component <b>98</b>, e.g. a bottom hole assembly component, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Starter head <b>66</b> is then raised along mast <b>32</b> allowing elevators <b>94</b> to pivot as component <b>98</b> moves via gravity towards alignment with the component support structure <b>38</b>, e.g. a rotary table. Once starter head <b>66</b> is raised sufficiently such that component <b>98</b> is suspended generally vertically above component support structure <b>38</b>, the component may be lowered into position by lowering starter head <b>66</b>. For example, component <b>98</b> may be lowered into an opening <b>100</b> through component support structure <b>38</b> for connection to a subsequent component. If a component <b>102</b> already has been suspended in component support structure <b>38</b>, then starter head <b>66</b> is used to move component <b>98</b> downwardly into engagement with component <b>102</b>, as illustrated by arrow <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Upon engagement of tool string components <b>102</b> and <b>98</b>, starter head <b>66</b> can be lowered to engage quill <b>76</b> with component <b>98</b>. As discussed above, motor <b>82</b> is then be used to rotate quill <b>76</b> and connect components <b>98</b>, <b>102</b>. Motor <b>82</b> also can be used to apply proper torque to the connection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The components and arrangement of components in coiled tubing and drilling rig <b>20</b> enable use of the rig in a wide variety of drilling operations and coiled tubing operations, including coiled tubing drilling operations. Additionally, the unique starter head <b>66</b> provides great functionality in the handling, connection and disconnection of well related components but with a low risk, highly reliable and relatively inexpensive apparatus. It should be noted, however, that a variety of components can be added to rig <b>20</b> or interchanged with illustrated components. Additionally, starter head <b>66</b> can be used in a wide variety of applications, including the assembly and disassembly of bottom hole assemblies, the assembly and disassembly of jointed pipe, and in numerous other applications. Also, coiled tubing injector <b>44</b> and coiled tubing spool <b>60</b> can be used in many types of coiled tubing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this invention. Such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims.</p>
