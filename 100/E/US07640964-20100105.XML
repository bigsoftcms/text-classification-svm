<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Magnetic tilt and raise/lower mechanisms for a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes of a multi-pane window are disclosed. The magnetic mechanisms act on tilt lines and a raise/lower line coupled to the venetian blind. An inner follower carriage is magnetically coupled to an external carriage moveable over one of the glass panes. Movement of the external carriage imparts movement of the follower carriage, which in turn actuates the tilt or raise/lower lines, causing the venetian blind to move. The inner follower carriage and the external carriage include at least one magnet assembly mounted on at least one wheel set to facilitate movement of the carriages over the glass panes as well as to reduce the force required to raise or lower the venetian blind. A multiplier is employed to reduce the stroke length required to raise or lower the venetian blind. Further, a clutch coupling an external slider to the external carriage is provided and to disconnect the slider from the external carriage upon the application of a force exceeding a threshold level.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to venetian blinds and in particular to magnetic tilt and raise/lower mechanisms for a venetian blind and to multi-pane windows incorporating the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Venetian blinds within double-glazed or multi-pane windows that include raise/lower and/or tilt mechanisms are known in the art. Venetian blinds of this nature typically include external magnets that are magnetically coupled to tilt and/or lift carriages disposed between the glass panes. The external magnets run along the exterior surface of the glass panes to move the tilt and/or lift carriages as a result of the magnetic coupling therebetween. Movement of the tilt carriage moves the tilt lines of the venetian blind causing the slats of the venetian blind to tilt and thereby open or close the venetian blind. Movement of the lift carriage moves the raise/lower line of the venetian blind causing the venetian blind to raise or lower. Many different tilt and/or lift mechanisms for these types of venetian blinds have been considered.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,817,698 to Rossini et al. discloses a raise and lower mechanism for a venetian blind disposed between a pair of glass planes. The raise and lower mechanism includes an internal magnet located between the glass panes and an external magnet for moving the internal magnet. Cables for lifting and lowering the venetian blind extend over a pulley and are coupled to a slider that is secured to the internal magnet. The stroke of the slider is equal to the maximum extension of the venetian blind. A counterweight is provided to balance the increasing weight on the cables as the venetian blind is raised. A tilt mechanism for the venetian blind is also provided and includes an internal magnet that is located between the glass panes and an external magnet for moving the internal magnet. A helical shaft extends the length of the venetian blind and is coupled to a second shaft via an angular return transmission. The second shaft is coupled to a tilt ladder. Linear movement of the internal magnet rotates the helical shaft, which in turn imparts rotation of the second shaft. Rotation of second shaft rotates the tilt ladder causing the venetian blind to open or close.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. Re 35,926 to Hagen discloses a raise and lower mechanism for a venetian blind disposed between two panes of glass. The raise and lower mechanism includes an external magnet that is magnetically coupled to an internal magnet positioned between the glass panes. Rotational movement of the external magnet causes the internal magnet to move. Movement of the internal magnet causes the venetian blind to raise or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Document No. 07-091153 to Yasushi et al. discloses a mechanism for raising and lowering a venetian blind disposed between a pair of glass panes. The raising and lowering mechanism includes a first magnet pair coupled to a shaft. The shaft is rotatable in response to movement of the first magnet pair. A second magnet pair that is magnetically coupled to the first magnet pair is disposed within an external lifting-lowering member. Linear movement of the external lifting-lowering member moves the first magnet pair to rotate the shaft. Rotation of the shaft winds or unwinds a cord thereby to raise or lower the venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">European Patent Application No. 082 723 to Anderson et al. discloses a tilting transfer mechanism for a venetian blind assembly disposed between the glass panes of a double glazing unit. The tilting transfer mechanism comprises an internal magnet located between the glass panes and an external magnet for moving the internal magnet. The internal magnet is coupled to hanger members, which support the slats of the venetian blind. Linear up and down movement of the internal magnet causes the hanger members to pivot and tilt the slats of the venetian blind thereby to open or close the venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,502 to Spangenberg discloses a tilting mechanism for a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes of a double-glazed window assembly. The tilting mechanism comprises an internal magnet located between the panes and an external magnet for moving the internal magnet. Linear movement of the internal magnet imparts rotational movement of upper and lower horizontal support members via a drive element. Rotation of the upper and lower support members causes the slats of the venetian blind to tilt thereby to open or close the venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,638 to Jelic discloses a tilt mechanism for a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes of a double-glazed window. The tilt mechanism comprises an internal magnet located between the glass panes and an external magnet for moving the internal magnet. The internal magnet is coupled to a tilt assembly. The tilt assembly includes a shaft that extends across the width of the venetian blind. The shaft is coupled to a tilt ladder, which supports the slats of the venetian blind. Specifically, the internal magnet is coupled to a nut that is mounted on a threaded rod. Linear movement of the nut in response to movement of the internal magnet causes the threaded rod to rotate, which in turn imparts rotation of the shaft thereby to open or close the venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,401,790 to Dai et al. discloses a tilt mechanism for a venetian blind comprising a first magnet located between the glass panes of a double-glazed window and an external second magnet magnetically coupled to the first magnet. The first magnet is also coupled to a pulley system. Movement of the first magnet in response to movement of the external second magnet actuates a tilt ladder causing the venetian blind to open or close.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese Patent Document No. 08-086167 to Takayuki et al. discloses a mechanism for operating a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes of a double-glazed window. The mechanism includes an internal magnet that is coupled by a cord to a shaft extending across the width of the venetian blind. An external magnet, which is located outside of the glass panes, is magnetically coupled to the internal magnet. A dial is provided for rotating the external magnet. Rotation of the dial and hence the external magnet, moves the internal magnet. Movement of the internal magnet actuates the cord to cause the shaft to rotate. Rotation of the shaft actuates a tilt ladder causing the venetian blind to open or close.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Japanese Patent Document No. 08-013957 to Takeshi et al. discloses a mechanism for tilting a venetian blind that is located between the glass panes of a double-glazed window. A rotatable disc is located outside of the glass panes and is coupled to a shaft via magnets. Rotation of the disc rotates the shaft. Rotation of the shaft actuates a tilt ladder causing the venetian blind to open or close.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As will be appreciated, although the double-glazed windows disclosed in the above-identified references include internal tilt and/or lift mechanisms making use of external magnets running over glass panes to actuate the internal tilt and/or lift mechanisms, problems exist. Since the external magnets are abrasive, movement of the external magnets over the glass panes often results in scratching and marking of the glass panes after extended use making the windows aesthetically unappealing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, a significant amount of force is required to overcome the coefficient of static friction between the external magnets and the glass panes when it is desired to actuate the internal tilt and/or lift mechanisms. This can result in an operator applying excessive forces to the external magnets, which may break the magnetic couple between the external magnets and the internal tilt and/or lift mechanisms. In the case of lift mechanisms, if the external magnets become magnetically de-coupled from the lift mechanisms when the venetian blind is in a fully or partially raised condition, the venetian blind may free fall to a lowered condition. This may potentially damage the venetian blind. Also, if the external magnets become magnetically decoupled from the internal tilt and/or lift mechanisms, the glass panes may be damaged when the magnet couple between the external magnets and the internal tilt and/or lift mechanism is re-established. Moreover, since the external magnets and the tilt and/or lift mechanisms are usually concealed, re-establishing the magnetic couple between the external magnets and the tilt and/or lift mechanisms can prove to be difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case of lift mechanisms, the pull ratio of the lift mechanisms is typically one-to-one. Thus, for every inch the venetian blinds are to be raised, the external magnets must be moved along the glass panes an equal distance. In the case of large multi-pane windows that accommodate correspondingly large venetian blinds, reaching and moving the external magnets the required distances to raise the venetian blinds to fully open conditions can be difficult, especially for elderly people, children, short people or people with back problems. As will be appreciated, improvements in magnetically actuatable mechanisms to raise/lower and/or tilt a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes of a multi-pane window are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel magnetic tilt and raise/lower mechanisms for a venetian blind and novel multi-pane windows incorporating the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-pane window having a magnetic mechanism for actuating a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes thereof, the magnetic mechanism comprising: an inner follower carriage disposed between the glass panes and operable to actuate said venetian blind when moved; an external carriage disposed outside the glass panes and magnetically coupled to said inner follower carriage, said external carriage being moveable thereby to move said inner follower carriage; and at least one friction reducing element to facilitate movement of at least one of said carriages over the glass panes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-pane window having a magnetic raise/lower mechanism for raising and lowering a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes thereof, the magnetic raise/lower mechanism comprising: a raise/lower line coupled to the venetian blind; an inner follower carriage disposed between the glass panes and operable to actuate said raise/lower line thereby to move said venetian blind; an external carriage disposed outside said glass panes and magnetically coupled to said inner follower carriage, said external carriage being moveable to move said inner follower carriage and actuate the raise/lower line; and a multiplier acting on the raise/lower line to increase the pull ratio of said magnetic raise/lower mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a multi-pane window having a magnetic raise/lower mechanism for raising and lowering a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes thereof, the magnetic raise/lower mechanism comprising: a raise/lower line coupled to the venetian blind; an inner follower carriage disposed between the glass panes and operable to actuate said raise/lower line thereby to move said venetian blind; an external carriage disposed outside the glass panes and magnetically coupled to said inner follower carriage, said external carriage being moveable to move said inner follower carriage and actuate the raise/lower line; an external slider coupled to said external carriage and operable to move said external carriage when said external slider is moved; and a clutch acting between said external carriage and said external slider and operable to decouple said external carriage from said external slider when a force exceeding a threshold level is applied to said external slider to inhibit said external carriage and said inner follower carriage from magnetically decoupling.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to still yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-pane window having a magnetic raise/lower mechanism for raising and lowering a venetian blind disposed between the glass panes thereof, comprising: a raise/lower line coupled to the venetian blind; an inner follower carriage disposed in a tubular housing between the glass panes and operable to actuate said raise/lower line thereby to move said venetian blind; an external carriage disposed outside the glass panes and magnetically coupled to said inner follower carriage, said external carriage being moveable to move said inner follower carriage and actuate said raise/lower line; and an accumulator disposed above said inner follower assembly and encompassing said raise/lower line to gather slack accumulating in said raise/lower line.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides advantages in that since the inner magnet assemblies and/or external magnet assemblies include friction reducing elements such as for example wheel sets, to facilitate movement of the magnet assemblies over the glass pane, the coefficient of friction between the magnet assemblies and the glass panes is significantly reduced. Sliding resistance can also be reduced by using structured sliding surfaces on the inner and external carriages, and/or on the surface of the glass panes. Additionally and/or alternatively, anti-friction surfaces can be provided on the surface of the glass panes to reduce sliding resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reducing resistance makes operating the venetian blind very easy. By reducing the coefficient of friction between the magnet assemblies, the likelihood of the glass pane being marked by the magnet assemblies due to wear is also reduced. Further, pull force and mechanical response is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides further advantages in that since the magnet assemblies are coupled to the inner and external carriages by magnetism only, i.e. floating couples, the magnet assemblies of the inner and external carriages remain aligned and in close proximity to the glass panes even if the glass panes are not perfectly planar. This helps to ensure a consistent magnetic couple between the inner and external carriages.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention provides yet further advantages in that since the raise/lower mechanism may include a multiplier, the pull ratio of the raise/lower mechanism can be increased to a ratio that is greater than one-to-one. This of course facilitates raising and lowering of the venetian blind. In addition, since the raise/lower mechanism may include a clutch that releases when excessive forces are applied to the external carriage, de-coupling of the inner and external carriages that may result in the venetian blind free falling to a fully lowered condition is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another advantage of the present invention is that, through the use of an accumulator, slack in the raise/lower line is gathered thereby avoiding tangling.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>10</b>, a multi-pane window is shown and is generally identified by reference numeral <b>20</b>. Multi-pane window <b>20</b> in this embodiment is a double-glazed window including a pair of spaced glass panes P. A venetian blind <b>22</b> including a plurality of slats <b>24</b> is disposed between the glass panes P. Tilt lines <b>26</b> and a raise/lower line <b>28</b> interconnect the slats <b>24</b>. The tilt lines <b>26</b> enable the slats <b>24</b> to be tilted thereby to open or close the venetian blind <b>22</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> enables the venetian blind <b>22</b> to be raised or lowered within the window <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The glass panes P are surrounded by a frame assembly <b>30</b>. Frame assembly <b>30</b> includes an upper tilt mechanism housing <b>32</b>, a tubular side raise/lower mechanism housing <b>34</b>, a side rail <b>36</b> and a bottom rail <b>38</b>. In this embodiment, housing <b>32</b> comprises an extruded PVC front portion and an aluminum rear portion. Housing <b>34</b> is entirely constructed of aluminum. Aluminum is used as it does not generally deform with changes in humidity and heat to which windows are typically subjected. Those skilled in the art will of course appreciate that other suitable materials can be used to form the housings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A magnetic tilt mechanism <b>50</b> is disposed within the housing <b>32</b> and is coupled to the tilt lines <b>26</b>. A magnetic raise/lower mechanism <b>60</b> is disposed within the housing <b>34</b> and is coupled to the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. As a result, actuation of the tilt and raise/lower mechanisms <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> allows the venetian blind <b>22</b> to be tilted open or closed and/or to be raised or lowered. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the housing <b>32</b> and the housing <b>34</b> are open and connect with one another to form an L-shaped housing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref> better illustrate the raise/lower mechanism <b>60</b>. The raise/lower mechanism <b>60</b> includes an inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> disposed within the housing <b>34</b> and an external carriage assembly <b>72</b> moveable over one of the glass panes P in line with and along the housing <b>34</b>. The inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> and the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> are magnetically coupled by a strong magnetic force. In this manner, linear movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> along the glass pane P over the housing <b>34</b> causes the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> to follow the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> and travel linearly within the housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> includes a pair of vertically spaced hollow bearing housings <b>80</b> formed of nylon or other suitable material. The bearing housings <b>80</b> are joined by a chassis comprising a pair of laterally spaced, elongate metal inner and outer support plates <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> respectively. Opposite sides of each bearing housing <b>80</b> accommodate a bearing <b>86</b>. The bearings <b>86</b> contact the interior surfaces of the housing <b>34</b> to guide the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> as it travels linearly within the housing <b>34</b>. A pulley <b>90</b> is disposed between the inner and outer support plates <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> adjacent the upper bearing housing <b>80</b> and is mounted on an axle <b>92</b> extending between the inner and outer support plates <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A series <b>94</b> of side-by-side magnet assemblies <b>100</b> is magnetically coupled to the outer support plate <b>82</b>. Each magnet assembly <b>100</b> includes a metal U-shaped carriage <b>102</b> housing a magnet <b>104</b> and at least one rolling mobilizer mounted on the carriage <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the rolling mobilizer is a wheel set <b>106</b>. The bight of each carriage <b>102</b> has a protrusion <b>110</b> formed thereon that is received by a corresponding dimple <b>112</b> formed in the outer support plate <b>82</b>. The co-operating protrusions and dimples maintain the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> in position while providing a floating couple for the magnet assemblies <b>100</b>. Each wheel set <b>106</b> includes a pair of wheels <b>114</b> with each wheel being mounted on a different arm of the carriage <b>102</b>. The wheels <b>114</b> are formed of plastic such as, for example, Nylatron&#xae;. The wheels <b>114</b> facilitate linear movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> as it travels within the housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The external carriage assembly <b>72</b> is disposed within a housing <b>120</b> positioned on the glass pane P. The external carriage assembly <b>72</b> includes an elongate metal support plate <b>130</b> having upper and lower guide wheels <b>132</b> rotatably mounted thereon adjacent its opposite ends. A series of side-by-side magnet assemblies <b>134</b> is magnetically coupled to the support plate <b>130</b>. The magnetic assemblies <b>134</b> are similar to the magnet assemblies <b>100</b>. Each magnet assembly <b>134</b> includes a metal U-shaped carriage <b>136</b> housing a magnet <b>138</b> and at least one rolling mobilizer, which in this embodiment is a wheel set <b>140</b> mounted on the carriage <b>136</b>. The bight of each carriage <b>136</b> has a protrusion <b>142</b> formed thereon that is received by a corresponding dimple <b>144</b> formed in the support plate <b>130</b>. The cooperating protrusions and dimples maintain the magnet assemblies <b>134</b> in position while providing a floating couple for the magnet assemblies <b>134</b>. Each wheel set <b>140</b> includes a pair of wheels <b>146</b> with each wheel being mounted on a different arm of the carriage <b>136</b>. The wheels <b>146</b> are also formed of plastic or other suitable material. The wheels <b>146</b> facilitate linear movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> as it travels within the housing <b>120</b> over the glass pane P.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A clutch <b>150</b> is magnetically coupled to the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>. As can be seen, the clutch <b>150</b> includes an elongate metal latch plate <b>152</b> having a magnet <b>154</b> secured thereto adjacent its upper end. The magnet <b>154</b> is associated with a magnet <b>156</b> secured to the support plate <b>130</b> adjacent its lower end. The latch plate <b>152</b> is fastened to an external slider <b>160</b> that is slidable along the outer surface of the housing <b>120</b>. Slider <b>160</b> is connected to the latch plate <b>152</b> via a U-shaped connector (not shown), the bridging portion of which travels through a slot (not shown) provided in the right side of the housing <b>120</b>. Movement of the slider <b>160</b> along the housing <b>120</b> is limited by lower and upper stops <b>158</b> and <b>159</b> respectively. The latch plate <b>152</b> extends into the housing <b>120</b> sufficiently so that the magnets <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> abut and magnetically couple as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> thereby to secure releasably the clutch <b>150</b> to the outer carriage assembly <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A raise/lower line pulley <b>170</b> and a raise/lower termination post <b>172</b> are disposed within the housing <b>34</b> adjacent the top right-hand corner of the multi-pane window <b>20</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> extending from the venetian blind <b>22</b> travels around the pulley <b>170</b> and passes through the upper bearing housing <b>80</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> then travels around the pulley <b>90</b> and back up through the upper bearing housing <b>80</b> before being secured to the termination post <b>172</b>. The roller <b>170</b>, pulley <b>90</b> and termination post <b>172</b> form a multiplier to increase the pull ratio of the raise/lower mechanism <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">During operation, when it is desired to raise or lower the venetian blind <b>22</b>, the slider <b>160</b> is grasped and slid in the desired direction along the housing <b>120</b> pulling the clutch <b>154</b> with it. As the slider <b>160</b> slides, the magnetic couple between the clutch magnets <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> causes the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> to move with the clutch <b>150</b>. During movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>, the wheels <b>146</b> of the magnet assemblies <b>134</b> facilitate the linear movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> along the glass pane P. Since the magnet assemblies <b>134</b> are aligned with and magnetically coupled to the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>, the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> is pulled with the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> as it moves. The bearings <b>86</b> on the bearing housings <b>80</b> and the wheels <b>114</b> on the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> facilitate movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> within the housing <b>34</b>. Linear movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> causes the pulley <b>90</b> to move relative to the pulley <b>170</b> and termination post <b>172</b>. If the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> is moved downwardly so that the pulley <b>90</b> moves away from the pulley <b>170</b> and termination post <b>172</b>, the venetian blind <b>22</b> is raised. If the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> is moved upwardly so that the pulley <b>90</b> moves towards the pulley <b>170</b> and termination post <b>172</b>, the venetian blind <b>22</b> is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The floating couple between the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> and outer support plate <b>82</b> and between the magnet assemblies <b>134</b> and the support plate <b>134</b> allow the magnet assemblies to remain aligned while accommodating surface variations. As a result, the integrity of the magnetic couple between the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> and the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As mentioned above, the pulley <b>170</b>, pulley <b>90</b> and termination post <b>172</b> arrangement act as a multiplier so that less movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> is required to raise or lower the venetian blind <b>22</b>. In this particular example since the pulley <b>170</b> and termination post <b>172</b> are positioned adjacent one another, the multiplier has a doubling effect so that one inch of movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> and, hence, one inch of movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>, raises or lowers the venetian blind <b>22</b> by two inches.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The magnetic attraction force between the magnets <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> of the clutch <b>150</b> is selected to be less that the magnetic attraction forces between the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>134</b>. In this manner, if a force is applied to the slider <b>160</b> that is greater than the magnetic attraction forces between the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>134</b>, the magnetic attraction forces between the magnets <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> will break before the magnetic attraction forces between the magnetic assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>134</b> can be broken. This helps to prevent the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> from being magnetically de-coupled from the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>, in the event of a sudden pull on the slider <b>160</b>, which as mentioned previously, can result in the venetian blind <b>22</b> free falling to a fully lowered position within the window <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref> to <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the magnetic tilt mechanism <b>50</b> is better illustrated. Magnetic tilt mechanism <b>50</b> includes a spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> extending along the housing <b>32</b>. The ends of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> are received by cradle assemblies <b>202</b> that permit the actuator rod <b>200</b> to rotate. A follower carriage <b>204</b> is mounted on the actuator rod <b>200</b> and is moveable therealong. Spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> is constructed of a non-magnetic material, such as stainless steel, plastic or carbon fiber, in order to reduce frictional resistance induced by magnetic attraction between the follower carriage <b>204</b> and the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>. The spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> includes a helically twisted central portion <b>201</b>. An external tilt carriage <b>206</b> is aligned with and magnetically coupled to the follower carriage <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each cradle assembly <b>202</b> includes a frame <b>210</b> having a base <b>212</b>. An opening <b>214</b> is provided through the base <b>212</b> at its center. A pulley <b>216</b> is mounted on the base <b>212</b> adjacent the opening <b>214</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> is wound around the pulleys <b>216</b>. The base <b>212</b> sits on a tubular pedestal <b>218</b> positioned below the opening <b>214</b>. A pair of upstanding side plates <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b </i>is positioned at opposite ends of the base <b>212</b>. Each side plate <b>220</b> has a passage <b>222</b> provided therethrough and supports a plurality of bearings <b>224</b> arranged to provide a channel therebetween. Pins <b>226</b> extend from the bearings <b>224</b> on side plate <b>220</b><i>a </i>and are received by holes provided in a stop comprising a side play thrust plate <b>228</b> having a ball bearing <b>229</b>. The side play thrust plate <b>228</b> inhibits axial movement of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>. A spool <b>230</b> is rotatably supported by the bearings <b>224</b> of the cradle assembly <b>202</b>. The spool <b>230</b> includes a pair of horizontally spaced larger diameter sections <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>separating inner and outer smaller diameter sections <b>230</b><i>c</i>, <b>230</b><i>d </i>and <b>230</b><i>e </i>respectively. The small outer diameter sections <b>230</b><i>d </i>and <b>230</b><i>e </i>are received by the passages in the side plates <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b </i>and are supported by the bearings <b>224</b>. The tilt lines <b>26</b> pass through the pedestal <b>218</b> and opening <b>214</b>. A recess <b>232</b> is provided in one end of the spool <b>230</b> and is shaped to receive one end of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The follower carriage <b>204</b> includes a rectangular metal chassis <b>250</b> having wheels <b>252</b> at its corners that contact the interior surfaces of the housing <b>32</b>. Similar to the raise/lower mechanism, the wheels <b>252</b> are formed of a plastic, such as Nylatron or other suitable material. The wheels <b>252</b> facilitate linear movement of the follower carriage <b>204</b> as it travels within the housing <b>32</b>. A plurality of formed and profiled rollers <b>254</b>, in this case four rollers, are mounted on the rear of the chassis <b>250</b> via posts <b>256</b>. The profiled rollers <b>254</b> have running surfaces designed to firmly contact the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> to oppose rotation of the actuator rod <b>200</b> relative to the profiled rollers <b>254</b>, while at the same time maintaining low friction rolling contact between the running surfaces of the profiled rollers <b>254</b> and the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>. A plurality of side-by-side magnet assemblies <b>260</b> is magnetically coupled to the front of the chassis <b>250</b>. The magnet assemblies <b>260</b> are somewhat similar to the magnet assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>134</b>. Each magnet assembly <b>260</b> includes a metal U-shaped carriage <b>262</b> housing a magnet <b>264</b> that is magnetically coupled to the carriage <b>262</b>. The bight of each carriage <b>262</b> has a protrusion <b>266</b> formed thereon that is received by a corresponding dimple (not shown) formed in the chassis <b>250</b>. The co-operating protrusions and dimples maintain the magnet assemblies <b>260</b> in position while providing a floating couple for the magnet assemblies <b>260</b>. Rectangular support plates <b>268</b> extend from opposite ends of the chassis <b>250</b>. Each support plate <b>268</b> rotatably supports a guide roller <b>270</b>. The guide rollers <b>270</b> contact the top and bottom surfaces of the housing <b>32</b> to guide the follower carriage <b>204</b> as it travels linearly within the housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The external tilt carriage <b>206</b> includes a slide housing <b>280</b> that is aligned with the actuator rod <b>200</b>. The slide housing is <b>280</b> secured to the front of the glass pane P and accommodates a tilt knob assembly <b>282</b>. The tilt knob assembly <b>282</b> is moveable linearly along the slide housing <b>280</b>. The slide housing <b>280</b> has a slide channel <b>284</b> formed in its rear surface. The tilt knob assembly <b>282</b> includes an external slider <b>290</b>, a support plate <b>292</b> spaced from the slider <b>290</b> and a web joining the support plate <b>292</b> and the slider <b>290</b>. The space between the slider <b>290</b> and the support plate <b>292</b> accommodates the slide housing <b>280</b> to position the support plate <b>292</b> in the slide channel <b>284</b>. A plurality of U-shaped channels <b>294</b> is secured to the support plate <b>292</b>. The bights of the channels <b>294</b> have dimples formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A plurality of side-by-side magnet assemblies <b>300</b> is magnetically coupled to the support plate <b>292</b>. The magnet assemblies <b>300</b> are aligned with and magnetically coupled to the magnet assemblies <b>260</b>. Each magnet assembly <b>300</b> includes a metal U-shaped carriage <b>302</b> housing a magnet <b>304</b> and having a wheel set thereon. The bight of the carriage <b>302</b> has a protrusion thereon that is received by the dimple formed in an associated channel <b>294</b>. The protrusions and dimples maintain the magnet assemblies <b>300</b> in position while providing a floating couple for the magnet assemblies <b>300</b>. Each wheel set includes a pair of wheels <b>306</b> with each wheel being mounted on a different shaft of the carriage <b>302</b>. The wheels <b>306</b> are also formed of plastic or some other suitable material. The wheels <b>306</b> facilitate linear movement of the tilt knob assembly <b>282</b> as it travels over the glass pane P along the slide channel <b>284</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">During operation, when it is desired to tilt the slats <b>24</b> of the venetian blind <b>22</b> to open or close the venetian blind, the slider <b>290</b> is grasped and the tilt knob assembly <b>282</b> is slid along the slide channel <b>284</b> in the desired direction. As the tilt knob assembly <b>282</b> slides and the support plate <b>292</b> moves linearly along the slide channel <b>284</b>, the magnet assemblies <b>300</b> travel with the support plate <b>292</b>. The wheels <b>306</b> of the magnet assemblies <b>300</b> facilitate this linear movement and reduce wear on the glass pane P. Since the magnet assemblies <b>300</b> are magnetically coupled to the magnet assemblies <b>260</b>, the follower carriage <b>204</b> is pulled linearly with the tilt knob assembly <b>282</b>. The wheels <b>252</b> and guide rollers <b>270</b> facilitate movement of the follower cartridge <b>204</b> within the housing <b>32</b>. Linear movement of the follower carriage <b>204</b>, and thus the profiled rollers <b>254</b> over the helically twisted central portion <b>201</b>, causes the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> to rotate. The bearings <b>224</b> and spools <b>230</b> allow for free and smooth rotation of the actuator rod. During linear movement of the follower carriage <b>204</b>, the profiled rollers <b>254</b> apply axial forces to the helically twisted central portion <b>201</b> of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>. Intimate abutment of the spools <b>230</b> fitted on the ends of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> with the bearings <b>229</b> of the thrust plates <b>228</b> effectively serves to inhibit axial movement of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>. The bearings <b>229</b> also reduce rotational friction between the spools <b>230</b> and the thrust plates <b>228</b> that results from the axial forces.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> rotates, the spools <b>230</b> fitted on the ends of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b> rotate. Depending on the direction of motion of the slider <b>290</b>, and thus the direction of rotation of the spiral actuator rod <b>200</b>, the spools <b>230</b> either pay in or pay out the tilt lines <b>26</b> pinned to the spools <b>230</b> causing the slats <b>24</b> of the venetian blind <b>22</b> to tilt and thereby either open or close the venetian blind <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As will be appreciated, the magnetic tilt and raise/lower mechanisms reduce friction, drag and wear due to the use of external and inner carriages that carry friction reducing elements, which in the above-described embodiment are rolling mobilizers. The floating couples associated with the magnetic assemblies maintain the integrity of the magnet coupling between the external and internal carriages. As a result, pull force and mechanical response is maintained at a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the housings <b>120</b> and/or <b>280</b> are secured to the glass pane P with adhesive, there is a possibility for a flexible but secure joint between the housings and the glass pane P. Such a joint allows the housings to displace slightly with respect to the glass pane P yet remain firmly fixed to the glass pane to accommodate imperfections in the glass pane, housings and carriages.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although the wheels of the magnet assemblies have been described as being formed of plastic or other suitable materials, combinations of materials may be used. For example, the wheels of the magnet assemblies can be formed of dual material i.e. the perimeters of the wheels can be formed of rubber with the remainder of the wheels formed of steel. In this case, the rubber flexes under loads allowing the centers of the wheels to contact the glass pane and offer shock resistance to breakage of the glass pane if the magnet assemblies slip and jump. This can happen if a sudden pull force is applied to the external carriages.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If desired, the wheels <b>114</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>252</b> and <b>306</b>, upper and lower guide wheels <b>132</b>, guide rollers <b>270</b>, pulley <b>170</b>, pulley <b>90</b> and profiled rollers <b>254</b> can all be mounted on precision ball bearings to decrease the rotational friction of these elements and increase their lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Other suitable means for allowing a floating couple between the chassis of the carriages and the magnet assemblies, such as holes, can be used in place of the dimples.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, alternative clutches for use with the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>, an extension plate <b>400</b> is secured to the bottom of the support plate <b>130</b>. Extension plate <b>400</b> includes a small bend that acts to hook onto the outer edge of the magnet <b>154</b>. When the clutch engages the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>, the latch plate <b>152</b> is positioned behind the extension plate <b>400</b> allowing the magnet <b>154</b> to magnetically couple to the extension plate <b>400</b>. As a result, the slider <b>160</b>, which is physically secured to the latch plate <b>152</b>, is both magnetically and mechanically coupled to the support plate <b>130</b> of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>. The greater the bend (up to 100 degrees) and the greater the length of the extended bent portion (up to the thickness of the magnet) of the extension plate <b>400</b>, the stronger the coupling force. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>, the latch plate <b>152</b> carries a roller arm <b>402</b> having a roller adjacent its distal end rather than a magnet. A clutch element <b>404</b> is secured to the bottom of the support plate <b>130</b> and receives the roller arm <b>402</b>. The clutch element <b>404</b> includes a pair of arms <b>406</b>, each of which carries a magnet <b>408</b> to bias the arms together thereby to retain the roller arm <b>402</b> therebetween. If desired, the magnets can be replaced with small tension springs to bias the arms <b>406</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a </i>to <b>15</b><i>c </i>show an alternative external carriage assembly <b>72</b> in various stages of assembly.

Roller assemblies <b>500</b> are provided at opposite ends of the support plate <b>130</b> to guide movement of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> along the housing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>show yet another embodiment of an external carriage assembly <b>72</b>. The external carriage assembly <b>72</b> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a </i>to <b>15</b><i>c</i>, however in this embodiment, rubber bumpers <b>800</b> are provided at opposite ends of the support plate <b>130</b> adjacent the rollers. Also, an intermediate roller is provided between the upper pulley and the point of connection between the slider <b>160</b> and the support plate <b>130</b>. Resilient bumper inserts <b>806</b> are integrated into end caps <b>802</b> affixed to the ends of the housing <b>120</b> by screws <b>804</b>. The end caps <b>802</b> limit travel of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>. Affixed to the bottom edge of the end caps <b>802</b> are adhesive strips <b>805</b>. The adhesive strips <b>805</b> secure the end caps <b>802</b> to the glass pane P and allow the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> and the housing <b>120</b> to be mounted and mechanically connected to glass pane P.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> reaches the upper or lower travel limit, the bumpers <b>800</b> of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> abut against the bumpers <b>806</b> of the end caps <b>802</b> and dampen the impact, thus reducing possible damage to the slider <b>160</b>, the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> and the housing <b>120</b>. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that it may be advantageous under certain circumstances to alternatively fasten the bumpers along the inside the housing <b>120</b> at positions other than at its upper and lower ends.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">While the bumpers have been described as being provided on the external carriage assembly <b>72</b>, it will be appreciated that bumpers can also be provided on the tilt mechanism to damper impacts.

Those of skill in the art will however appreciate that these assemblies are also suitable for use with the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> and the external carriage <b>72</b> of the raise/lower mechanism <b>60</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>a</i>, a rolling mobilizer assembly having two different rolling mobilizer assembly portions are shown. The rolling mobilizers are coupled to the housing and provide a rolling surface for flat carriage undersurfaces.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>d </i>are front and side sectional views of a variant of the rolling mobilizer assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, wherein a set of carriage tracks <b>612</b> having bearings enclosed therein is affixed to the flat carriage <b>606</b> bearing the magnet <b>608</b> to provide the rolling means.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows another embodiment of a raise/lower mechanism including a mechanical stop <b>700</b> and a tangle inhibitor <b>701</b> disposed within the housing <b>34</b> above the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. The mechanical stop <b>700</b> is positioned within the housing <b>34</b> at the upper travel limit of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> and external carriage assembly <b>72</b>, and is affixed to the housing <b>34</b> by fastener screws <b>706</b> passing through the housing <b>34</b> and the mechanical stop <b>700</b>. The tangle inhibitor <b>701</b> includes a wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and an isolating bumper <b>704</b>. The wiper-bumper <b>702</b> is secured to the isolating wiper <b>704</b> and the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> by a screw <b>708</b>. Each of the mechanical stop <b>700</b>, the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the isolating wiper <b>704</b> are provided with two through-holes through which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the isolating wiper <b>704</b> are closely fitted to the inner walls of the housing <b>34</b> to define a cavity between the upper surface of the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the mechanical stop <b>700</b>. The cavity confines the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to inhibit the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from becoming entangled with inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. At the same time, the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the isolating wiper <b>704</b> produce little or no resistance to linear sliding movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> within the housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As will be appreciated, the tangle inhibitor <b>701</b> inhibits the raise/lower bar line <b>28</b> from getting caught or entangled about or under the wheels of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> or between the inner follower carriage and guide assembly and the walls of the housing when the venetian blind is lowered. Such tangling of the raise/lower line is most likely to occur when the venetian blind is raised creating slack in the raise/lower line <b>28</b> and then lowered or &#x201c;dropped&#x201d; very quickly. Rapid movement of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> upwards may cause an equally rapid accumulation of the raise/lower lien just above of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly inside the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Slack created in the raise/lower line may form a &#x201c;mass&#x201d; that gets compressed and compacted by upward movement of the inner carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. This compression may lead to resistance of the movement of the raise/lower line and/or entanglement. By maintaining the slack in the raise/lower line <b>28</b> in the cavity above the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> through use of the tangle inhibitor <b>701</b>, these problems are avoided</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The isolating wiper <b>704</b> is best illustrated in the magnified exploded portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and includes a plurality of springs <b>704</b><i>a</i>, spring plates <b>704</b><i>b </i>and wiper strips <b>704</b><i>c </i>that co-operatively function to seal/isolate slack in the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. The spring elements <b>704</b><i>a </i>apply pressure to the wiper strips <b>704</b><i>c </i>that contact the inner walls of housing <b>34</b>. Alternatively, springs or resilient surfaces can be incorporated into the upper and lower faces of the isolating wiper <b>704</b> so that it can absorb impact, decreasing the requirement to use the isolating wiper <b>704</b> in conjunction with the wiper-bumper <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The mechanical stop <b>700</b> halts continued upward travel of the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> along the housing <b>34</b>. This facilitates magnetic recoupling of the external carriage assembly <b>72</b> and the internal follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> in the event that they inadvertently become magnetically decoupled. The mechanical stop <b>700</b> is constructed of a resilient material, such as, for example, rubber and is designed to withstand recurring impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> is a &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; single element, namely a homogenous piece of resilient material that performs a dual function. First, wiper-bumper <b>702</b> isolates the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. Additionally, wiper-bumper <b>702</b> absorbs energy resulting from impacts between the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b> and the mechanical stop <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The isolating wiper <b>704</b> only serves as a wiper and does not provide resilient means to absorb any impact energy.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To protect the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from impact damage when the isolation wiper-bumper <b>702</b> impacts the mechanical stop <b>700</b>, both the mechanical step <b>700</b> and wiper-bumper <b>702</b> are furnished or manufactured with soft, non-wear materials, i.e. felt, rubber or similar components.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Those of skill in the art will appreciate that each of the mechanical stop <b>700</b>, the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the isolating wiper-bumper <b>704</b> can be used alone or in combination with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As mentioned above, when the slider <b>160</b> is raised, the raise/lower line <b>28</b> collects within the cavity between the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> and the mechanical stop <b>700</b> inhibiting the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from becoming entangled with the inner follower carriage and guide assembly <b>70</b>. If desired an accumulator can be placed within the cavity to control the manner in which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> collects.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a folding accumulator <b>710</b> disposed within the housing <b>34</b> between the mechanical sop <b>700</b> and the wiper-bumper <b>702</b>. The folding accumulator <b>710</b> in this embodiment is a fan-like member made of a very thin, flexible, non-abrasive, wear resistant material and having a number of folds defining segments. The folding accumulator <b>710</b> is secured, at its top end, to the mechanical stop <b>700</b> by two fastening screws <b>711</b><i>a</i>. Alternately, the top of the folding accumulator <b>710</b> can be secured to the mechanical stop <b>700</b> by means of other fasteners or an adhesive. The lower end of the folding accumulator <b>710</b> is secured to the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> via a pair of screws <b>711</b><i>b</i>. The lower end of the folding accumulator <b>710</b> can also be attached to the wiper-bumper <b>702</b> via an adhesive or other means of attachment. The folding accumulator <b>710</b> acts to fold or bend the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to gather it in a more organized fashion within the cavity as the raise/lower line <b>28</b> collects, thus making it easier for the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to unravel and extend as the venetian blind <b>22</b> is lowered. Little or no clamping force on the raise/lower line <b>28</b> or resistance to movement of the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is caused by the folding accumulator <b>710</b> due to its flexibility and smooth internal and external surfaces. The folding accumulator <b>710</b> also serves to protect the raise/lower line <b>28</b> from surface friction and wear against the inner walls of the housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the folding accumulator <b>710</b> in a partially folded condition. As is shown, slack created in the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is gathered between the folds of the folding accumulator <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>a </i>shows an alternative embodiment of a folding accumulator <b>712</b>. In this example, the folding accumulator <b>712</b> is tubular and completely surrounds the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. The folding accumulator <b>712</b> is shaped to form an accordion tubular member having folding walls and a through-passage through which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is routed. A section of the folding accumulator <b>712</b> is cut away for illustrative purposes to expose the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. In this figure, the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is under tension and not gathering.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>, shows the folding accumulator <b>712</b> in a partially folding condition. As is shown, the folding walls of the folding accumulator operably gather slack in the raise/lower line <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The folding accumulator may also be furnished with internal elements or dividers to improve the folding and retraction performance of the raise/lower line <b>28</b> within the accumulator. Such elements can include pins, folding membranes, strings, fins, flexible spirals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref><i>a </i>shows a folding accumulator <b>714</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, but including a number of internal dividing posts <b>716</b> that assist in the gathering of the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref><i>b </i>shows a folding accumulator <b>718</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, but including an internal folding wall <b>720</b> connected to a set of internal dividing posts that collectively induce excess length of the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to gather.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As will be appreciated, the accumulators can be &#x201c;open&#x201d; to various degrees or fully closed. In the &#x201c;open&#x201d; configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, at least a portion of the accumulator is open to the inner walls of the housing <b>34</b>, in which case the raise/lower line <b>28</b> may be exposed to, and come in contact with, the inner walls of the housing <b>34</b>. In the closed configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a </i>to <b>24</b>, there is no direct contact between the raise/lower line <b>28</b> and the walls of the housing <b>34</b>, reducing friction and were on the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. Although closed accumulators reduce friction and were on the raise/lower line <b>28</b>, an open configuration reduces the space utilized by the folding accumulator.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Although the folding accumulators illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref><i>b </i>are of the linear accordion-type, other types of folding accumulators can be used such as for example spiral accordions and telescoping mechanisms. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref><i>c </i>shows an example of a spiral accordion <b>722</b> having an internal spiral divider for encouraging any excess length of raise/lower line <b>28</b> to collect therein.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref> illustrate the placement of folding accumulators around each section of raise/lower line <b>28</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the folding accumulator <b>724</b> is of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the accumulator <b>726</b> is of the telescopic-type having a through-passage through which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is routed. The accumulator <b>726</b> includes a number of sections that interleave in a compressed condition. Where such a telescopic accumulator is made of rigid sections, the positioning of the mechanical stop <b>700</b> can be adjusted to compensate for the fixed length of the compressed telescopic accumulator <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 32</figref> show alternative embodiments of raise/lower mechanisms including multipliers. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref> show an alternative raise/lower mechanism <b>900</b> including a follower assembly comprising a lower elevator <b>904</b> and an upper elevator <b>908</b> slidably received in the inner housing <b>34</b>. The lower elevator <b>904</b> and the upper elevator <b>908</b> are connected via an elevator line <b>916</b> looped around a top elevator pulley <b>920</b> and a bottom elevator pulley <b>924</b> such that movement of the lower elevator <b>904</b> in one direction along the interior of the housing <b>34</b> is mirrored by movement of the upper elevator <b>908</b> in the opposite direction. The lower elevator <b>904</b> has a bracket <b>928</b> supporting a multiplier pulley <b>932</b> that is rotatably mounted therein. The upper elevator <b>908</b> includes an arm <b>936</b> to which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is secured. From the arm <b>936</b> of the upper elevator <b>908</b>, the raise/lower line <b>28</b> routes around the multiplier pulley <b>932</b> of the lower elevator <b>904</b> and then travels up and over the fixed pulley <b>170</b>. An external slider carriage <b>948</b> is magnetically coupled to a set of magnets <b>952</b> secured to the side of the lower elevator <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As will be appreciated, downward movement of the slider carriage <b>948</b> and hence lower elevator <b>904</b> causes upward movement of the upper elevator <b>908</b>, both lengthening the span between the arm <b>936</b> of the upper elevator <b>908</b> and the multiplier pulley <b>932</b>, and the span between the multiplier pulley <b>932</b> and the pulley <b>170</b>. This, in turn, causes the venetian blind to be raised and lowered. In this arrangement, the multiplier has a trebling effect so that one inch of movement of the external slider carriage <b>948</b> and hence, one inch of movement of the lower elevator <b>904</b>, raises or lowers the venetian blind by three inches.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Another alternative raise/lower mechanism <b>1000</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>. In this embodiment, the raise/lower mechanism includes a follower assembly comprising a lower elevator <b>1004</b> and an upper elevator <b>1008</b> slidably received in the inner housing <b>34</b>. The lower elevator <b>1004</b> and the upper elevator <b>1008</b> are connected via an elevator line <b>1016</b> looped around a top elevator pulley <b>1020</b> and a bottom elevator pulley <b>1024</b> such that movement of the lower elevator <b>1004</b> in one direction along the interior of the housing <b>34</b> is mirrored by movement of the upper elevator <b>1008</b> in the opposite direction. The lower elevator <b>1004</b> has a bracket <b>1028</b> supporting a two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b> that is rotatably mounted therein. The two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b> is segmented effectively to provide a smaller circumferenced pulley portion <b>1056</b> and a larger circumferenced pulley portion <b>1060</b>. The upper elevator <b>1008</b> has an arm <b>1036</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> is secured to and pre-wound around the larger pulley portion <b>1060</b> a number of times before traveling up and over the pulley <b>170</b>. A wind line <b>1042</b> is secured to and pre-wound around the smaller pulley portion <b>1056</b> a number of times before traveling up to the arm <b>1036</b>, to which it is secured. An external slider carriage <b>1048</b> is magnetically coupled to a set of magnets <b>1052</b> secured to the side of the lower elevator <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Upon downward movement of the external slider carriage <b>1048</b> and hence lower elevator <b>1004</b>, the upper elevator <b>1008</b> travels upward, lengthening the span between the arm <b>1036</b> of the upper elevator <b>1008</b> and the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b>. As tension is placed on the wind line <b>1042</b>, the wind line <b>1042</b> places torque on the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b>, causing it to turn. Turning of the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b> unwinds the wind line <b>1042</b> wound around the smaller pulley portion <b>1056</b> and, in turn, pulls and winds the raise/lower line <b>28</b> around the larger pulley portion <b>1060</b>. It will be appreciated that the length of the raise/lower line <b>28</b> wound around the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1032</b> during a rotation thereof is greater than the length of the wind line <b>1042</b> that is wound therearound, thus providing a multiplier effect. As the lower elevator <b>1004</b> moves downwards, the span between the multiplier pulley <b>1032</b> and the pulley <b>170</b> increases, thus increasing the speed at which the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is drawn around the pulley <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Upon upward movement of the slider carriage <b>1048</b>, the arm <b>1036</b> and the bracket <b>1028</b> move towards one another, and the wind line <b>1042</b> and the raise/lower line <b>28</b> loosen while the venetian blind drop under the force of gravity. The gravitational pull tightens the wind line <b>1042</b> and the raise/lower line <b>28</b> which produces a rotational torque that acts to wind the wind line <b>1042</b> on the smaller pulley portion <b>1056</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In this particular arrangement, the multiplier generally has a trebling effect so that one inch of movement of the external slider carriage <b>1048</b> and, hence, one inch of movement of the lower elevator <b>1004</b>, raises or lowers the venetian blind by three inches. It will be appreciated, that alteration of the ratio of the circumferences of the smaller and larger pulley portions <b>1056</b>, <b>1060</b> will increase or decrease the multiplier effect of the two-step multiplier pulley and, thus, the overall multiplier effect.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> show yet another embodiment of a raise/lower mechanism <b>1100</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>.

A lower fixed idler pulley <b>1144</b> and an upper fixed idler pulley <b>1148</b> are secured within the inner housing <b>34</b> and spaced apart to provide free rotation of the pulleys <b>1136</b>, <b>1140</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> is secured to the bottom of the window frame <b>1156</b> and routed around the lower fixed idler pulley <b>1144</b>, the lower pulley <b>1136</b>, the upper pulley <b>1140</b>, the upper fixed idler pulley <b>1148</b> and then the pulley <b>170</b>. A slider carriage <b>1164</b> is magnetically coupled to a set of magnets <b>1168</b> secured to the lower elevator <b>1104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Downward movement of the external slider carriage <b>1164</b> and hence lower elevator <b>1104</b> causes the upper elevator <b>1108</b> to travel upward, lengthening the span between the brackets <b>1128</b>, <b>1132</b> of the lower and upper elevators <b>1104</b>, <b>1108</b>. As the raise/lower line <b>28</b> is routed around the lower and upper fixed idler pulleys <b>1144</b>, <b>1148</b>, and as brackets <b>1128</b>, <b>1132</b> move apart from each other, a multiplier of three to four is achieved so that one inch of movement of the external slider carriage <b>1164</b> and, hence, one inch of movement of the lower elevator <b>1104</b>, raises or lowers the venetian blind by three to four inches. Upward movement of the external slider carriage <b>1164</b> causes the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to loosen thereby to lower the Venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> show still yet another embodiment of a raise/lower mechanism <b>1200</b>. In this embodiment, the raise/lower mechanism includes a follower assembly comprising an elevator <b>1204</b> slidably received in the inner housing <b>34</b>. The elevator <b>1204</b> is connected to an elevator line <b>1216</b> looped around a bottom elevator pulley <b>1120</b> and a two-step multiplier pulley <b>1224</b>. The two-step multiplier pulley <b>1224</b> has a smaller circumferenced pulley portion <b>1228</b>, around which the elevator line <b>1216</b> is routed, and a larger circumferenced pulley portion <b>1232</b>. A secondary elevator line <b>1236</b> is routed around the larger pulley portion <b>1232</b> of the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1224</b> and around a secondary bottom pulley <b>1240</b>. Coupled to the secondary elevator line <b>1236</b> is a secondary elevator <b>1244</b> that provides a point of securing for the raise/lower line <b>28</b>. The raise/lower line <b>28</b> is routed around the pulley <b>170</b>. An external slider carriage <b>1256</b> is magnetically coupled to a set of magnets <b>1260</b> secured to the elevator <b>1204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Downward movement of the slider carriage <b>1256</b> and hence the elevator <b>1204</b> causes the elevator line <b>1216</b> to apply a torque force to the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1224</b>. As the two-step multiplier pulley <b>1224</b> is rotated under the torque force, the secondary elevator line <b>1236</b> is rotated with it. The secondary elevator <b>1244</b> is accordingly moved downwardly with the secondary elevator line <b>1236</b>, pulling the raise/lower line <b>28</b> around the pulley <b>170</b> and raising the venetian blind. The secondary elevator line <b>1236</b> provides a dampening effect for any force transmitted to the secondary elevator <b>1244</b> by the venetian blind during lowering. In this particular arrangement, the multiplier has a variable effect depending on the ratio of the smaller and larger pulley portions <b>1228</b>, <b>1232</b> of the two-step pulley <b>1224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Other means for transmitting movement between the elevators and the raise/lower line will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, belts or chains could replace the various elevator lines. Where chains are used, the pulleys could be provided with sprocket teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the alternative raise/lower mechanisms described above can benefit from combination with the clutch mechanisms discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 36</figref> show yet another embodiment of a magnetic raise/lower mechanism for use with the multi-pane window, wherein the rolling mobilizers have been replaced with an alternative friction reducing arrangement that includes sliding elements. In particular, in this embodiment the raise/lower mechanism includes an inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> that is secured to the raise/lower line <b>28</b> and slidably mounted inside the inner housing. The inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> is in sliding contact with a vertically aligned anti-friction surface <b>1308</b> secured to the inside surface of one of the panes of glass <b>1360</b>. An external slider carriage <b>1312</b> is slidably mounted inside the external housing. The external slider carriage <b>1312</b> is in sliding contact with a vertically aligned anti-friction surface <b>1316</b> secured to the outside surface of the pane of glass <b>1360</b>. The anti-friction surfaces <b>1308</b>, <b>1316</b> are positioned to effectively form a sandwich with the glass pane.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">A slider pad <b>1320</b> on the undersurface of the inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> is shown having a structured sliding surface comprising of a number of raised protrusions with cavities therebetween. The protrusions are rounded and provide a suitable sliding surface. A number of inserts <b>1324</b> are inserted into the cavities and secured therein via an adhesive, fusion or the like. The inserts <b>1324</b> act to reduce friction between the inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> and the anti-friction surface <b>1308</b>. In the present embodiment, the inserts <b>1324</b> are made from felt, but can also be made from resilient rubber, foam rubber, mesh, etc. The inserts <b>1324</b> are designed to resist compression and friction, and can be impregnated with a lubricant in order to further reduce friction with the anti-friction surface.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> better illustrates the slider carriages <b>1304</b>, <b>1312</b>. The inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> is shown having a slider body <b>1344</b> onto which are affixed three magnets <b>1348</b>. Secured to the magnets <b>1348</b> is a resilient pad <b>1352</b> of foam rubber, felt, or another suitable material. The resilient pad <b>1352</b> acts to distribute the pressure from magnetic forces more evenly to predetermined mating contact areas. A slider pad <b>1356</b> similar to slider pads <b>1320</b> and <b>1328</b> is affixed to the resilient pad <b>1352</b>. The slider pad <b>1356</b> may be fused and integrated into the structure of the resilient pad <b>1352</b> and can be impregnated with a lubricant, such as silicone or poly disulfide. As mentioned above, the inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> is in intimate sliding contact with the anti-friction surface <b>1308</b> affixed to the glass pane <b>1360</b>. The anti-friction surface <b>1308</b> can be any suitable surface for allowing free sliding travel of the inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> thereover, such as a nylon pad, a tape or an applied or fused coating applied to the surface of the glass pane <b>1360</b>, such as Teflon, over which the inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> is expected to travel.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A slider pad <b>1328</b> on the undersurface of the external slider carriage <b>1312</b> is shown having a sliding surface <b>1330</b> comprising a celled structure having a number of cells. The edges of the celled structure are level and provide a suitable sliding surface. The celled structure may be metallic, non-metallic or some combination of both. The sliding surface <b>1330</b> of the celled structure can be of a low friction material, such as Teflon&#xae; or Nylatron. Contact pads <b>1332</b> are inserted into the cells of the celled structure and secured therein. The contact pads <b>1332</b>, like the inserts <b>1324</b>, act to reduce friction between the slider carriage and the anti-friction surface <b>1316</b> and resist compression. The contact pads <b>1332</b> can be constructed of felt, resilient rubber, foam rubber, mesh or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The external slider carriage <b>1312</b> is shown having an external control comprising a slider <b>1364</b> onto which are affixed three magnets <b>1368</b>. Secured to the magnets <b>1368</b> is a resilient pad <b>1372</b> of foam rubber, felt, or another suitable material, and a slider pad <b>1376</b> such as slider pads <b>1320</b> and <b>1328</b>. The external slider carriage <b>1312</b> as mentioned above is in intimate sliding contact with the anti-friction surface <b>1316</b> affixed to the glass pane <b>1360</b> opposite the anti-friction surface <b>1308</b>. The anti-friction surface <b>1316</b> is also constructed in a similar manner to the anti-friction surface <b>1308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Upon downward movement of the external slider carriage <b>1312</b>, the magnetically-coupled inner follower slider carriage <b>1304</b> mirrors its movement, pulling raise/lower line <b>28</b> downward. In turn, the raise/lower line <b>28</b> pulls on the venetian blind to raise it. Upward movement of the external slider carriage <b>1312</b> releases the raise/lower line <b>28</b> to lower the venetian blind.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A pair of alternative contact pads <b>1336</b>, <b>1340</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. The first alternative contact pad <b>1336</b> has a ball-bearing mounted therein and the second alternative contact pad <b>1340</b> has a roller mounted therein. Both the balls and the rollers can be static on dynamic. Static balls and rollers could have surfaces of Teflon, Nylatron or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Other forms of structured sliding surfaces will occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">While the celled structure of the slider pad <b>1328</b> is shown having a linear array of rectangular cells, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the cells can be provided in a number of configurations without significantly decreasing the effectiveness of the slider pad <b>1328</b>. For example, parallelogram-shaped cells and honeycomb-patterned cells have been found to work satisfactorily. Additionally, it is to be understood that either of the two undersurface configurations (that is, inserts or contact pads) or a combination thereof can be employed on each slider carriage.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">One or both of the anti-friction surfaces <b>1308</b>, <b>1316</b> can be constructed in the same manner as the slider pads <b>1320</b>, <b>1328</b>. Where the anti-friction surfaces <b>1308</b>, <b>1316</b> are constructed with slider pads having dynamic balls or rollers, decreased friction can be provided between the slider carriages <b>1304</b>, <b>1312</b> and the anti-friction surfaces <b>1308</b>, <b>1316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the slider carriages <b>1304</b> and <b>1312</b> can be used in combination with the clutch and multiplier mechanisms described previously. Also, arrangements including slider carriages and wheeled assemblies can be used in either or both of the raise/lower and tilt mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, those of skill in the art will appreciate that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.</p>
