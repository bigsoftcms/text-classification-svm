<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to building construction. More specifically the invention relates to systems and methods of supporting floors and roofs of buildings.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some methods of constructing buildings, floors and roofs may be created and/or located in their final position after construction of a central structure. These floors and roofs must be supported in some manner so as to provide stability for activity to occur on the floor or roof during and after construction. Typical construction methods, especially for high-rise buildings, support each floor from the ground upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Often a great number of vertical structural members, columns for example, provide such support, and extend throughout the height of the building. The weight of these vertical structural members must be supported by the vertical structural members below them, compounding design factors at lower levels of the building. Additionally, valuable floor space on each floor may be lost, or at least become unusable, because of the protrusion of each vertical structural member. Embodiments of the present invention provide solutions to this and other problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, a system for supporting a floor structure from a central structure is provided. The system may include a plurality of receptacles and a plurality of support members. Each of the plurality of receptacles may be located within the central structure and possibly located at a corner of an exterior perimeter of the central structure. Each of the plurality of receptacles may also at least partially define a cavity, where the cavity opens to two different sides of the central structure. Each of the plurality of support members may be configured to pass through the cavity of at least one of the plurality of receptacles. Each of the plurality of support members may be further configured to be supported by at least one of the plurality of receptacles, and possibly extend outward from two different sides of the central structure. Each of the plurality of support members may be further configured to support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a method for supporting a floor structure from a central structure is provided. The method may include providing a plurality of receptacles within the central structure, where each of the plurality of receptacles at least partially defines a cavity. Each cavity may open to two different sides of the central structure. The method may also include moving the floor structure to an elevation above the plurality of receptacles. The method may further include providing a plurality of support members and supporting the plurality of support members with the plurality of receptacles, where each of the support members may pass through the cavity of at least one of the plurality of receptacles. The method may moreover include supporting the floor structure with the plurality of support members, where each support member may support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a system for supporting a floor structure from a central structure is provided. The system may include a first means for supporting a support member from the central structure such that the support member extends outward from two different sides of the central structure. The system may also include a support member, where the support member is configured to support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, a system for supporting a floor structure from a central structure is provided. The floor structure and the central structure may be of any construction. In an exemplary embodiment, the floor structure may be constructed of structural steel members and concrete, and the central structure may be a building core constructed of rebar reinforced concrete, poured and formed in place. Though in many embodiments the central structure may be polygonal in cross section, in some embodiments the central structure may have a perimeter that is for some portion curved, or even entirely curved. In curved embodiments, different &#x201c;sides&#x201d; of the central structure may be assumed to include any appreciably different angular location about the curved surface of the central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the central structure and/or the floor structure may be part of a larger building. Some possible buildings in which systems and methods of the invention may be employed are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/746,834, filed May 10, 2007 and entitled &#x201c;Multi-Story Building,&#x201d; the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. Though floor structures are discussed throughout this description, it will become appreciable that the systems and methods of the invention may also be employed to support roof structures from central structures as well.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the system may include a plurality of receptacles and a plurality of support members. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of receptacles may be located within the central structure and possibly at a corner of an exterior perimeter of the central structure. In these or other embodiments, each of the plurality of receptacles may also at least partially define a cavity, and the cavity may open to two different sides of the central structure. In some embodiments, one or more receptacles may include a buttressing member configured to at least assist in maintaining the shape of the cavity. In some of these embodiments, the buttressing member may be at least generally aligned with a vertical edged corner of the central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, each of the plurality of support members may be configured to pass through the cavity of at least one of the plurality of receptacles. In these or other embodiments, the support members may also be configured to be supported by at least one of the plurality of receptacles, and possibly extend outward from two different sides of the central structure. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of support members may also be configured to support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the floor structure surround at least some portion of the central structure and may be configured to move up and/or down some portion of the height of the central structure. In these or other embodiments, the support members may be movably coupled with the underside of the floor structure. As such, the support members may initially be in a first position which allows the floor structure to move up and/or down the central structure without interference by the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the floor structure is finally located at a desired elevation, the support members may be moved from the first position to a second position where each support member passes through a cavity of a receptacle, possibly extending outward from two different sides of the central structure. The floor may then be lowered slightly such that the support members are supported by the receptacle and the floor structure is supported by the support members. Therefore, in some embodiments, the support member may support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure. Note that in some embodiments, the floor may be supported as such from more than one central structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the system for supporting the floor structure from a central structure may also include a means for moving a support member between the first position to the second position described above. In some embodiments, the means for moving the support member may be actuated from a topside of the supported floor structure. Such means may be installed at any point during construction, and possibly when the floor is at an elevation in proximity to the working ground level of the building site.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment having a means for moving the support member, the means may include the support member being slidably coupled with the underside of the floor structure. A reversibly coupled vertical extension may be coupled to the support member in proximity to the end of the support member furthest from the central structure. A slotted breach in the floor structure may allow the vertical extension to penetrate the floor structure and protrude from the topside of the floor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This vertical extension may be used by a person or automated device on the topside of the floor structure to move the support member between the first position and the second position. The vertical extension's maximum travel may be determined by the length of the slotted breach, which may therefore assist in determining how far the support member may be moved. Once in the second position, the vertical extension may be decoupled (possibly via a threaded coupling), and the slotted breach may be filled to make the topside of the floor structure continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment having a means for moving the support member, the means may also include the support member being slidably coupled with the underside of the floor structure. A flexible member, such a cabling or rope, may be coupled with the support member in proximity to the end of the support member furthest from the central structure. A breach in the floor structure may allow the flexible member to penetrate the floor structure and protrude from the topside of the floor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flexible member may be pulled by a person or automated device on the topside of the floor structure to move the support member from the first position to the second position. In some embodiments, a pulley or other pivot point may assist in directing the force of pulling on the flexible member to more appropriately align with the location of the cavity with respect to the support member. The flexible member may also have a stop-member coupled with the flexible member in a location which assists in determining how far the flexible member may be pulled through the breach, and hence how far the support member may be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once in the second position, the flexible member may be pushed back through the breach, cut, or otherwise removed, and the breach may be filled to make the topside of the floor structure continuous. In yet other embodiments, the support member may be spring loaded, or compressed gas and/or magnets may be used to move the support member into position remotely from the topside of the floor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, one or more receptacles may include at least one vertical member, possible coupled with the top and/or bottom of the receptacle. In an exemplary embodiment, two vertical members may be included with each receptacle. Vertical members may, in some embodiments, at least assist in locating the receptacle in vertical relation to the ground or another receptacle. Additionally, vertical members may assist in transferring load from thee receptacle to the central structure in which the receptacle may be encased or coupled to. In one embodiment, the length of the vertical member may be related to the height of the floor-to-ceiling space below or above the receptacle. In some embodiments, where the central structure is made from a poured in place hardenable substance, such as concrete, the vertical members may be coupled with a collar coupled with either the ground, or another receptacle, before or during pouring to ensure proper elevation locating of the receptacle. In some embodiments, each receptacle positioned to assist in supporting a particular floor may have a vertical element of the same length as others supporting the particular floor.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the vertical members of the receptacles, or any other portion of the receptacle, may be coupled with reinforcement members within the central structure. Merely by way of example, in embodiments where the central structure is rebar reinforced poured in place concrete, rebar within the concrete may be coupled with the vertical members of the receptacles.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other embodiments, methods for supporting a floor structure from a central structure are provided, some of which may utilize the one or more of the systems described above. The method may include providing a plurality of receptacles within the central structure. In embodiments where the central structure is poured from a hardenable substance, the method may possibly include inserting the receptacles into the central structure during pouring of the hardenable substance. In some embodiments, and as discussed above, the receptacles may also be coupled with reinforcement members in the central structure. As described above, the receptacles may also include attached, or separate, vertical members which may at least assist in locating the receptacles vertically with respect to other receptacles or the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method may further include moving the floor structure to an elevation at or above the plurality of receptacles. The method may then include providing a plurality of support members and supporting the plurality of support members with the plurality of receptacles, and then supporting the floor structure with the plurality of support members, where each support member may support the floor structure on two different sides of the central structure. The floor structure may be lowered some distance so that the weight of the floor structure causes the support members to be supported by the receptacles, and the floor structure by the support members.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the method may also include activating means for moving support members from their first or initial positions, underneath the floor structure, to their final or second positions, supported by the receptacles. In some embodiments, systems mentioned above may be activated, either from the topside of the floor structure or otherwise, to cause the support members to be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an axonometric view of a receptacle <b>100</b> of the invention. Receptacle <b>100</b> may include a body <b>110</b> which defines a cavity <b>120</b>. The cavity may have a support surface <b>130</b> which will allow a support member (not shown) to be supported by receptacle <b>100</b>. A buttressing member <b>140</b> may at least assist in maintaining the shape of cavity <b>120</b> when receptacle <b>100</b> is put under either dynamic or static loading.

Vertical members <b>150</b> may mate with collars on another receptacle or at ground level, possibly similar to collars <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>AA shown on receptacle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an axonometric view <b>200</b> of two receptacles <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B of the invention embedded in a portion of a central structure <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, cavities <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B of each receptacle <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B open to different, and adjacent, sides of structure <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, rebar <b>220</b> is shown coupled with the vertical member <b>150</b>A (shown broken because of the large distance between receptacles <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B). Multiple numbers and type of rebar <b>220</b> or other reinforcement members may be coupled with vertical members <b>150</b>A, <b>150</b>AA in any number of fashions, including welding and/or rebar tie wire. Even though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, rebar <b>220</b> may also be coupled with other vertical members such as vertical members <b>150</b>B, <b>150</b>BB and vertical members <b>150</b>C, <b>150</b>CC.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, corners <b>220</b> of central structure <b>210</b> may be reinforced and/or thicker than walls of central structure <b>21</b> <b>0</b>. This may allow for room and proper structural support of receptacles <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Vertical members <b>150</b>A, <b>150</b>AA of receptacle <b>100</b>A may mate with collars <b>160</b>B, <b>160</b>BB of receptacle <b>100</b>B during construction of central structure <b>210</b> to at least assist in properly locating the receptacles <b>100</b>, and consequently the final locations of floor structures placed about central structure <b>210</b>. Note that in some embodiments, vertical members <b>150</b> could be configured differently than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, vertical members <b>150</b> may be separate from bodies <b>110</b>, while in other embodiments, vertical members <b>150</b> may be coupled with the top of bodies <b>110</b>, rather than the bottom of bodies <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are buttressing members <b>140</b>. Buttressing members <b>140</b> may at least assist in cavities <b>120</b> maintaining their shape under the static and dynamic loading during and after construction of central structure. By maintaining the shape of cavities <b>120</b>, it is more likely that support members will be able to be inserted into receptacles <b>100</b>. Buttressing members <b>140</b> may have any shape, and merely by way of example may have square, triangular, polygonal, or round cross sections.</p>
