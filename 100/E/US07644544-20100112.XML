<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to providing riders of motorcycles, bicycles, four-wheelers and other small personal transportation vehicles with a compact security shelter device. People often use motorcycles, bicycles and other vehicles for personal transportation. When a rider arrives at a destination or location such as an office, a recreational facility, a motel or even their residence, they rarely if ever have any means of securely protecting their vehicle. Their only choice typically is to park in an uncovered parking space with no security or protection from the elements or vandalism. Often they look for a fixed, immovable object that they might be able to chain or cable the vehicle to so that it (or at least most of it) will still be there when the rider returns. Unprotected motorcycles are often subject to people attempting to remove any items left on the motorcycle and unlocked bicycles are easily stolen or damaged. The present focus of this invention is the development of a new, inexpensive and secure way of protecting these personal transportation devices. To be most effective, such a device should conform generally to the approximate size and shape of such personal transportation vehicles so as not to take up excess space.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to its major aspects and broadly stated, the present invention is a protective unit for motorcycles, bicycles, four-wheelers and similarly small personal transportation vehicles. This invention is designed to be used at motels, recreational facilities, homes, offices and similar places where people might need to protect their small personal transportation vehicle from thefts and the elements. This invention is designed with a means of securely locking the stored vehicle inside and securely anchoring the unit to the ground. The lid is designed to be light weight and to have spring loaded shocks that assist the user in raising or lowing the lid.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The front view of the current preferred embodiment of the apparatus is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this &#x201c;clam-shell&#x201d; style invention provides users with the opportunity, in most cases, to ride their motorcycle or bicycle or similar personal transportation device directly in to the unit (<b>10</b>). There the rider will typically put down a kick-stand or other device to stand the vehicle up in the unit. An additional embodiment of the invention includes an alignment brace for the front wheel that may be used to keep the vehicle upright in the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There are vents located on each side of the unit in both the bottom (<b>36</b>) and the upper halves (<b>26</b>) for purposes of airflow to avoid a buildup of fumes or heat in the unit. Gas or similar compression cylinders facilitate the lifting of the upper half of the device or the lid as it will be commonly be called. Through the use of these support cylinders, the lifting of the lid mechanism is made less heavy than it would otherwise be and when lowering the lid the dampening effect produced by the cylinders keeps the lid from smashing down. The preferred embodiment includes a sloping roof (<b>20</b>) to make a modest reduction in materials and thus the weight of the lid. The lid can be locked down (<b>34</b>) to the lower half of the unit by a standard locking mechanism (<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In its preferred embodiment, this invention is manufactured from extruded plastic or fiberglass and has a weight that allows it to be moved into place by one or two people. Typically the unit is attached or secured to the ground or other surface it sits on, but this is not a requirement and temporary use may not involve attachment. It has few moving parts and a molded handle (<b>22</b>) for simple operation. The molded floor of this invention includes lock-down plates (<b>32</b>) that are located on the interior of the unit so that they cannot be tampered with for security purposes. Cork-screw type pins that are capable of being tightened or loosened by hand pass through these lock-down plates (<b>32</b>) at the interior four corners of the unit. When inserted into a dirt surface and tightened, these pins make it more difficult to move or remove the unit with its enclosed transportation vehicle. Alternatively, other devices such as stakes or bolts can be used to anchor the unit to dirt, concrete, asphalt or other surfaces without changing the nature of the invention. Additionally, the hinge (<b>40</b>) between the upper shell (<b>20</b>) and the bottom half (<b>30</b>) of the unit is located on the interior for security purposes as this reduces the chance that a criminal can gain access through removal of the pin in said hinge (<b>40</b>). This invention will keep the motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle out of the weather and provide security from theft or vandalism through its lid locking mechanism (<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment of the invention, it provides additional security through including a security alarm system similar to that of a car, except that it would be deactivated by the user entering a code within a short period (estimated to be approximately 10 to 15 seconds) after opening the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This invention hides the type of personal transportation device from the eyes of a person passing by. It can be made mobile where it is not permanently affixed to the ground so that it can be transported from location to location in the back of a truck or similar vehicle. This mobility can be especially helpful in circumstances where for example a user goes to a rally or similar gathering and wishes to have this protective unit available for their motorcycle, bicycle or similar personal transportation vehicles while at the event.</p>
