<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fire door lock, and in particular to a fire door lock comprising a movable seat, which when actuated and moved by a handle bar, moves first and second slide blocks and a lock tongue inward to further drive first and second latch bars inwards to unlock the fire door, and which, when the door is closed and a tongue control plate is brought into contact with an external fixture and thus actuated, automatically returns to the original locked position to stretch the first and second latch bars outward to secure the fire door and also cause a tongue holder seat to abut against and maintain the tongue in the locked condition thereby realizing a three-directional locking of the fire door.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fire door locking mechanisms are known, such as Taiwan Patent Publication No. 568161, which discloses in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> of the attached drawings thereof a central locking mechanism <b>3</b> and upper and lower locking mechanisms <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> that are coupled to the central locking mechanism <b>3</b>, and a transmission mechanism <b>9</b> that is coupled to the central locking mechanism <b>3</b> so that when an operating handle bar is depressed, the transmission mechanism <b>9</b> drives the central locking mechanism <b>3</b>, which in turn drives the upper and lower locking mechanisms <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> to operate in a simultaneous manner for locking and unlocking a fire door.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional device, although effective in overcoming the drawback of other known fire door mechanism that no upper and lower vertical latching are included. However, such a conventional device does not include horizontal latching or locking so that when the fire door can be broken in by breaking a middle portion of the door. Thus, further improvement is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other prior art references, such as U.S. Pat. No. 7,144,050, suffer the same drawback.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, it is desired to provide an improved fire door lock that enhances security of the fire door, while maintaining easy operation by a user to open the door.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a fire door lock comprising a base assembly, which comprises a bottom plate on which first and second slide blocks are slidably mounted, a locking control assembly, which comprises a movable seat forming a groove and a tongue control plate movably mounted to one side of the locking control assembly, and a winglet assembly, which comprises first and second winglets, which both have a boss movably received in the groove of the movable seat and both being respectively and rotatably coupled to the first and second slide blocks. Thus, when the movable seat is driven by an operating handle bar, the movable seat is driven to move the first and second slide blocks to withdraw first and second latch bars to thereby unlock the fire door. When the fire door is closed, the tongue control plate is hit and acted to allow the movable seat to return to the locked condition and the first and second latches and a tongue are stretched out to realize three-directional locking.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing object and summary provide only a brief introduction to the present invention. To fully appreciate these and other objects of the present invention as well as the invention itself, all of which will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the following detailed description of the invention and the claims should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Throughout the specification and drawings identical reference numerals refer to identical or similar parts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which a preferred structural embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.</p>
