The washer <b>106</b><i>b </i>can be an anti-wear metal member to prevent the screw <b>106</b><i>a </i>from scratching a surface of the stationary member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exploded view of a hinge body of the expansion device according to one embodiment of this invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates two opposite sides of the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The hinge body <b>107</b> provides the rotatable member <b>104</b> a temporary positioning function. The hinge body <b>107</b> includes a hollow cylinder <b>109</b>, a movable part <b>107</b><i>a</i>, one (or more) resilient part <b>111</b> and a cover <b>113</b>. The hollow cylinder <b>109</b> has positioning slots <b>109</b><i>c </i>(in inner walls) and cutouts <b>109</b><i>d</i>. The cutouts <b>109</b><i>d </i>of the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> is to restrict a rotation range of the bar <b>105</b><i>a </i>(of the rotatable member <b>104</b>). Disk-shaped movable part <b>107</b><i>a </i>has positioning convex portions <b>107</b><i>d</i>, several engraved portions <b>107</b><i>c </i>and a hole <b>107</b><i>b</i>. The positioning convex portions <b>107</b><i>d </i>of the movable part <b>107</b><i>a </i>engages with the positioning slots <b>109</b><i>c </i>of the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> such that the movable part <b>107</b><i>a </i>slides within the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> along an axial direction (of the hollow cylinder <b>109</b>). The engraved portions <b>107</b><i>c </i>are radially arranged on a side of the movable part <b>107</b><i>a</i>, i.e. the engraved portions <b>107</b><i>c </i>radially extend from the hole <b>107</b><i>b </i>to form a cross-shaped engraved portion. The cover <b>113</b> has a hole <b>113</b><i>a </i>and mounting holes <b>113</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When components of the hinge body <b>107</b> are assembled, the movable part <b>107</b><i>a </i>and the resilient part <b>111</b> are sequentially disposed inside the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> and then the cover <b>113</b> is fixed to the hollow cylinder <b>109</b>. The mounting holes <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>113</b> engages with mounting pins <b>109</b><i>b </i>of the hollow cylinder <b>109</b>, ends of the mounting holes <b>113</b><i>b </i>are pressed such that the cover <b>113</b> is fixed to the hollow cylinder <b>109</b> to secure the movable part <b>107</b><i>a </i>and the resilient part <b>111</b> within the hollow cylinder <b>109</b>.
