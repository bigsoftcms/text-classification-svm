<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a waste removal system and more particularly to a ultra-low flushing volume toilet and a related toilet pan, flushing method and drainline.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The expression &#x201c;ultra-low flushing volume&#x201d; is herein defined as having nominal full and reduced flush volumes of about 3 liters and 2 liters respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The design of water closets (WCs) in Australia has been greatly influenced by the need to minimise water consumption and maintain an adequate sanitation system to safe guard and maintain a high level of public health.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since 1982 reductions in Australian WC flushing volume have lead to a major lowering of the average daily WC water consumption per person from 55 liters to 18 liters. A major contribution to this reduction was the development of the two button, dual flush WC having 6/3 liter reduced flush technology which gave the user the choice of applying either a 6 liter full flush or a 3 liter reduced flush option to operate the WC.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a toilet and related componentary that can operate directly into a sewer with a ultra-low flushing volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a toilet pan for a ultra-low flushing volume toilet, the pan including:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">a rearward end adapted for positioning substantially adjacent a cistern;</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a frontward end adapted for positioning substantially remote the cistern; and</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a flushing water outlet having a primary outlet nozzle arrangement disposed substantially adjacent the pan frontward end and adapted to direct flushing water downwards and towards the pan rearward end.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pan preferably also has a S-bend outlet trap with a pan end and sewer end and the primary outlet nozzle arrangement is also adapted to direct flushing water towards and/or into the S-bend pan end.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The S-bend pan end includes a substantially straight pipe section and the primary outlet nozzle arrangement is also adapted to direct flushing water substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pipe section.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A majority of the flushing water is preferably directed to the primary outlet nozzle arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The primary outlet nozzle arrangement preferably includes a plurality of outlet nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pan preferably also has a secondary outlet nozzle arrangement, most preferably in the form of a single nozzle, disposed substantially adjacent the pan rearward end and adapted to direct a minority of the flushing water substantially downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The pan preferably also has tertiary outlet nozzle arrangements, most preferably in the form of holes, disposed along the sides of the pan and adapted to direct a minority of the flushing water substantially downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pan preferably includes a rear wall leading to the S-bend and the secondary outlet nozzle arrangement is adapted to direct flushing water downwards along the rear wall.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The minority of the flushing water is preferably directed to the secondary outlet nozzle arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pan preferably includes a manifold adapted for fluid communication with a flushing outlet of the cistern and the primary or the primary and secondary outlet nozzle arrangements. The manifold preferably substantially replicates the shape of upper rim of the pan.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one form, the manifold is formed separately from the pan and is preferably releasably engageable therewith. In another form, the manifold is formed integrally with the pan. In a further form, the manifold is formed integrally with the toilet seat.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of flushing a toilet pan for a ultra-low flushing volume toilet, the pan having a rearward end adapted for positioning substantially adjacent a cistern and a frontward end adapted for positioning substantially remote the cistern, the method comprising directing a majority of a cistern's flushing water in a concentrated jet from the upper forward end of the pan towards the lower rearward end of the pan in a direction substantially aligned with the frontward-to-rearward centreline of the pan.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method preferably also comprises directing a minority of a cistern's flushing water from the upper rearward end of the pan along a rear wall of the pan end towards the lower rearward end of the pan.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method preferably also comprises directing a minority of a cistern's flushing water down the sides of the pan.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The method preferably also comprises inducing a partial syphon action into the waste outlet of the pan by directing the majority of a cistern's flushing water directly into the pan outlet in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the leading section of the pan outlet, whereby the partial syphon action lowers the level of the water in the pan during the commencement of the flush.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a third aspect, the present invention provides a toilet pan for a ultra-low flushing volume toilet, the pan comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">a flushing outlet; and</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">an outlet trap in fluid communication with the flushing outlet, the outlet trap comprising a first downwardly concave lower bend and a second upwardly convex upper bend,</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">wherein the pan cross-sectional shape at an upper level horizontally aligned with the upper surface of the first bend defines a first relatively larger cross-sectional area and the pan's cross-sectional shape at a lower level horizontally aligned with the lower surface of the second bend defines a second relatively substantially smaller cross-sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the first cross-sectional area is approximately double the size of the second cross-sectional area.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, there is shown a first embodiment of a toilet suite <b>20</b> incorporating aspects of the invention. The suite <b>20</b> generally comprises a full and reduced flushing volume cistern <b>22</b> (known as a flush tank in the United States) operated by a pair of button actuators <b>24</b>, which are accessible through the top surface of a cistern body <b>26</b>. The cistern <b>22</b> is placed within the larger cistern body <b>26</b> as, due to its ultra-low flushing volume, it would appear out of scale (ie. too small) with the remainder of the toilet suite <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The suite <b>20</b> also comprises a pan <b>28</b> connected to the cistern <b>22</b> by a flush pipe <b>30</b>. A toilet seat <b>32</b> and lid <b>34</b> are pivotally mounted to the pan <b>28</b> by hinges, which are well known. The pan <b>28</b> has a rearward end <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a frontward end <b>28</b><i>b </i>and a rim <b>36</b> about an opening <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A flushing water manifold <b>40</b> is located beneath the rim <b>36</b> and is in fluid communication with the flush pipe <b>30</b>. The manifold <b>40</b> has a primary outlet nozzle arrangement <b>42</b> positioned near the frontward end <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the cistern <b>28</b> and a smaller secondary outlet nozzle arrangement, in the form of single nozzle <b>44</b>, positioned adjacent the rearward end of the pan <b>28</b><i>a. </i>The primary outlet nozzle arrangement <b>42</b> has four outlet nozzles <b>46</b>, which are best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The manifold <b>40</b> also has a number of tertiary outlet nozzle arrangements, in the form of holes <b>48</b>, disposed along the sides of the pan <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the preferred embodiment shown, the manifold <b>40</b> is a separate, substantially oval shaped plastic component that substantially replicates the shape of the pan rim <b>36</b>. In other embodiments (not shown), the manifold is formed integrally with the pan or with the toilet seat.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pan <b>28</b> also includes a flushing outlet <b>50</b> which is connected to a mains sewerage system in a known manner. The flushing outlet <b>50</b> is preceded by an S-bend outlet trap <b>51</b> formed from a first downwardly convex lower bend <b>52</b> and a second upwardly convex upper bend <b>54</b>. The pan <b>28</b> also has a rear wall <b>56</b> which is upwardly angled from the rear of the pan <b>28</b> at about 10&#xb0; from horizontal. The front wall <b>58</b> of the pan <b>28</b> has an upper relatively steeply angled portion <b>58</b><i>a, </i>lower relatively steeply angled portion <b>58</b><i>b, </i>which is substantially parallel to and rearwardly displaced from the upper portion <b>58</b><i>a, </i>and an intermediate relatively shallowly angled portion <b>58</b><i>c </i>therebetween. The portion of the pan <b>28</b> adjacent the lower front wall portion <b>58</b><i>b </i>is substantially cylindrical and has a central longitudinal axis <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The operation of the suite <b>20</b> will now be described. Pressing one of the actuator buttons <b>24</b> initiates flushing of the suite <b>20</b>. The flushing water is communicated from the cistern <b>22</b> to the flush pipe <b>30</b> and so to the flushing water manifold <b>40</b>. The majority of the flushing water (approximately 80%) exits the manifold <b>40</b> via the four nozzles <b>46</b> in the primary outlet arrangement <b>42</b>, as indicated by the large arrow <b>62</b> and is directed towards the commencement of the S-bend outlet trap <b>51</b> in a direction substantially parallel with the axis <b>60</b> of the cylindrical portion of the pan <b>28</b> adjacent the front wall lower portion <b>58</b><i>b. </i>Directing the flushing water <b>62</b> in this way concentrates the energy of the flushing water into the outlet trap <b>51</b> and results in adequate clearing of waste (equal to or better than current standards for known 6/3 liter full/reduced flush toilet suites) within the pan <b>28</b> with the 3/2 liter ultra-low flushing volumes. A minority of the flushing water is directed through the outlet <b>44</b>, as indicated by medium arrow <b>64</b>, to wet and clean the rear wall <b>56</b> of the pan. An even smaller amount of the flushing water is directed out of the holes <b>48</b> as indicated by small arrows <b>66</b> to wet and clean the sides of the pan <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The water level in the pan <b>28</b> in the absence of a flush is denoted <b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. During the previously described flushing action, the energy of the majority of the flushing water <b>62</b> creates a partial syphoning action within the outlet trap <b>51</b> which results in the water level during the flush falling to approximately that denoted <b>70</b>. The surface area at the level <b>70</b> is approximately half that at the level <b>68</b> and the corresponding reduction in cross sectional area of the outlet trap <b>51</b> further increases the velocity, and thus concentrates the energy, of the flushing water through the trap <b>51</b>, further aiding in waste clearance. The larger surface area at the water level <b>68</b> also advantageously provides a larger target area for user's wastes, particularly solid wastes. Further advantageously, the geometric centre of the surface area of the water at level <b>68</b> is substantially vertically aligned with the approximate solid waste drop position of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, before flushing, the pan <b>28</b> advantageously provides a large target surface area (at level <b>68</b>) to minimise the likelihood of waste being incident on non wetted regions of the pan <b>28</b>. During flushing, the pan <b>28</b> advantageously provides a reduced surface area (at level <b>70</b>) to concentrate the energy of the flushing water. This combination also contributes to the improved clearing of waste in the pan <b>28</b> with ultra-low flushing volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> show a second embodiment of suite <b>80</b> incorporating aspects of the invention which is similar to the suite <b>20</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> and in which like reference numerals are used to indicate like features. The difference between the suite <b>80</b> and <b>20</b> is the suite <b>80</b> has a hand washing basin <b>82</b> integrally formed with the cistern body <b>26</b>. After flushing, the mains water used to fill the cistern <b>22</b> is directed to a free outlet tap <b>84</b> whereafter it flows from the basin <b>82</b> through a pipe <b>84</b> and into the cistern <b>22</b>. This arrangement provides further reductions in overall water usage by allowing a user to wash their hands with water that is then reused as flushing water rather than washing their hands in water that is directly returned to the sewer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged detailed view of the preferred form of primary outlet nozzle arrangement <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 17</figref> are similar views of other primary outlet nozzle arrangements <b>42</b> with outlet nozzles <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The primary outlet nozzle arrangement <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is the most preferred and is formed from upper and lower moulded halves <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>respectively. The outlets <b>46</b> each receive a separate portion of the flushing water from either side of the manifold <b>40</b>. This reduces the turbulence, and energy loss, of the two streams of water hitting each other during entry to the primary outlet nozzle arrangement <b>42</b>, compared to earlier embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 15</figref>. Further, the outlets <b>46</b> include upper, lower and side edges <b>46</b><i>a, </i><b>46</b><i>b </i>and <b>46</b><i>e </i>respectively which are shaped to form the flow of flushing water (as exemplified by the arrow <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) into a cross sectional shape similar to that of the surface of the water in the pan <b>28</b> at level <b>68</b>. Directing and shaping the flushing water <b>62</b> to cover all of the water surface at level <b>68</b> serves to maximise the amount of waste that is directed into the waste S-bend outlet trap <b>51</b> and out through the flushing outlet <b>50</b>. Concentrating and directing the energy of the flushing water <b>62</b> into the trap <b>51</b> in this way improves waste clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an end view of a drainline <b>90</b> suitable for use with the ultra-low flushing volume toilet suites described above. The drainline <b>90</b> is characterised by an internal height H to width W ratio between about 1.4:1 and 1.5:1 and an internal upper radius R to lower radius r ratio of about 3:1. It has been found that these ratios provide a drainline with an optimum balance between waste transportation at low flow rates (less than 2.5 liters/second) due to increased flow velocity in the lower (and slimmer) portion of the drainline <b>90</b> and total capacity at high flow rates. The preferred size of the drainline <b>90</b> is an internal height H of 130 mm, internal width W of 90 mm, upper internal radius R of 45 mm and lower internal radius r of 15 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the suites <b>20</b> and <b>80</b> were matched with the drainline <b>90</b>, and their performance benchmarked against an industry leading 6/3 liter dual flush toilet suite, the following results were obtained from a comparison of potable water usage and savings for the suites <b>20</b>, <b>80</b> and the 6/3 liter dual flush WC based on daily water usage per person of five flush cycles (one full flush and four reduced flush cycles).</p>
