<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Logging procedures are carried out in wells to evaluate a variety of well characteristics, including production characteristics and formation characteristics. Generally, a logging tool is moved downhole into a wellbore to perform the logging procedure. The logging tool can contain a variety of sensors for detecting many types of parameters that can be used to evaluate desired well characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some applications, production logging procedures are carried out while well equipment is located within the wellbore. However, the presence of equipment within the wellbore creates difficulties with respect to logging past or below the equipment. Attempts have been made to utilize a Y-tool as a bypass while a pumping system is deployed downhole. The Y-tool is a diverter type device having two legs or passages with one dedicated to the pumping system and the other leading to the wellbore below the pumping system. In other attempts, the logging tool has been deployed alongside of an electric submersible pumping string via a wireline, and specially designed plates are used to protect the wireline from damage during installation of the pumping string and during logging procedures. However, such systems can be difficult to use and susceptible to damage. In still other attempts, a hollow shaft of a combined motor and pump has been used as both a production flow path and as a passageway along which components can be moved downhole. However, the system was not designed for operation until removal of the component from the hollow shaft to enable production flow. The system also did not incorporate a motor protector.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the present invention provides a system for logging within a wellbore while well equipment is deployed in the wellbore. The well equipment can be deployed downhole within the wellbore to perform a well related function, e.g. production of well fluid. A logging tool system is designed for cooperation with the well equipment and can be moved internally through the well equipment for performance of logging procedures beneath the well equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention relates to a system and methodology for performing logging procedures in a well. For example, the system and methodology can be used for production logging while well equipment is deployed within the wellbore. In well operations, e.g. production operations, well equipment is deployed at the desired location within a wellbore. The well equipment is designed with a longitudinal passageway to accommodate passage of a well logging system to enable well logging procedures below the well equipment. By way of example, the well equipment may comprise an electric submersible pumping system having an internal, longitudinal passageway through which a well logging tool is deployed. The internal, longitudinal passageway can be designed to enable operation of the well equipment, e.g. operation of the electric submersible pumping system, during performance of the logging procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a well <b>20</b> comprises a wellbore <b>22</b> that extends downwardly through one or more subterranean formations <b>24</b>. The formations <b>24</b> often hold desired production fluids, such as hydrocarbon based fluids. In the example illustrated, wellbore <b>22</b> extends downwardly from a wellhead <b>26</b> located at a surface <b>28</b> above wellbore <b>22</b>. Surface <b>28</b> may comprise a surface of the earth or a seabed floor. The wellbore <b>22</b> may be lined with a casing <b>30</b> and may have perforations <b>32</b> through which fluids can pass between formation <b>24</b> and wellbore <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A well system <b>34</b> is deployed in wellbore <b>22</b> and may have a variety of configurations depending on the specific well operation to be performed. Generally, well system <b>34</b> comprises well equipment, i.e. one or more well components <b>36</b>, and a logging system <b>38</b> deployed longitudinally through an interior of the one or more well components <b>36</b>. By way of example, well components <b>36</b> may comprise an electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b> deployed in wellbore <b>22</b> via a tubing <b>42</b>, and logging system <b>38</b> may comprise a well logging tool <b>44</b> deployed through tubing <b>42</b> and well components <b>36</b> via a deployment line <b>46</b>, such as a slick line or wireline. In the example illustrated, electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b> comprises a submersible pump <b>48</b> powered by a submersible motor <b>50</b>. The submersible pump <b>48</b> may be coupled to tubing <b>42</b> by a pump head <b>52</b>. Additionally, one or more motor protectors can be used, such as a motor protector <b>54</b> positioned between submersible motor <b>50</b> and submersible pump <b>48</b> and a lower motor protector <b>56</b> positioned below submersible motor <b>50</b>. It should be noted, however, the number and arrangement of well components can change depending on the environment and specific well application. For example, motor protector <b>54</b> can be located at other positions along the electric submersible pumping system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The well logging tool <b>44</b> on wireline <b>46</b> can be run through well components <b>36</b>, e.g. through electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>, for performance of a well logging operation below well components <b>36</b>. Additionally, the electric submersible pumping system can be operated to move well fluids during deployment of the logging tool or while the logging processes take place. In one embodiment, the well logging tool is moved through the electric submersible pumping system, and the wireline remains in a stationary position within a rotating shaft of the operating electric submersible pumping system, as discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An example of well logging system <b>38</b> extending through an upper portion of electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As illustrated, submersible pump <b>48</b> comprises an outer housing <b>58</b> coupled to tubing <b>42</b> by an engagement portion <b>60</b> of the housing <b>58</b>. Engagement portion <b>60</b> may be coupled to tubing <b>42</b> by, for example, a threaded engagement region <b>62</b>. Submersible pump <b>48</b> further comprises a plurality of pumping stages having rotationally stationary diffusers <b>64</b> and corresponding rotatable impellers <b>66</b> for pumping wellbore fluid upwardly along a production fluid flow path <b>67</b> extending through at least a portion of electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b> and into tubing <b>42</b>. The rotatable impellers <b>66</b> are rotated by a shaft <b>68</b> driven by submersible motor <b>50</b>. Shaft <b>68</b> may be formed by a plurality of shaft sections <b>70</b> with individual shaft sections disposed in corresponding individual wellbore components, e.g. submersible pump <b>48</b>, submersible motor <b>50</b> and motor protector <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiment illustrated, the shaft <b>68</b> has a hollow interior <b>72</b> forming a longitudinal passageway <b>74</b> through which well logging system <b>38</b> is moved longitudinally along an interior of well system <b>34</b>. Longitudinal passageway <b>74</b> is separate from production fluid flow path <b>67</b> which facilitates production of fluid while, for example, wireline <b>46</b> extends through longitudinal passageway <b>74</b>. The upper end of shaft <b>68</b> is rotatably coupled with pump head <b>52</b> which may be positioned within engagement portion <b>60</b> of submersible pump housing <b>58</b>. By way of example, the coupling of shaft <b>68</b> and pump head <b>52</b> may be achieved with a series of labyrinth seals <b>76</b> that seal the pump discharge pressure during logging procedures, such as production logging. Seals <b>76</b> also can be used as journal bearings similar to those in a conventional submersible pump head, and the seals may be made from a bearing material, such as graphitized silicon carbide. By using multiple sections of labyrinth seals, the likelihood of forming cracks is reduced and the total pressure load over the region is divided.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As an alternate embodiment, a &#x201c;leaky&#x201d; seal can be used around wireline <b>46</b> to generate a hydraulic downward friction force on the wireline cable <b>46</b> inside shaft <b>68</b>. The downward force is particularly useful with a stiff wireline cable <b>46</b> that resists buckling when pushed. Combining the stiff cable and pushing force is helpful when logging certain types of wells including highly deviated wells, e.g. horizontal wells. The pushing force can enable performance of the logging operation in a highly deviated well without a wireline tractor. The specific location of the &#x201c;leaking&#x201d; fluid can be varied as long as the fluid is directed along the wireline cable to create the desired insertion force on the wireline.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The coupling also may utilize sleeves <b>78</b> and load rings <b>80</b> positioned along the shaft <b>68</b> intermediate labyrinth seals <b>76</b>. Bushings <b>82</b> can be positioned radially outward of the sleeves <b>78</b> within pump head <b>52</b> such that sleeves <b>78</b> rotate with shaft <b>68</b> within stationary bushings <b>82</b>. Additionally, a retaining ring <b>84</b> can be positioned generally at the lower end of pump head <b>52</b>. O-rings can be used in mounting sleeves <b>78</b> to shaft <b>68</b> to eliminate leakage under the sleeves. O-rings also can be used along the outside diameter of bushings <b>82</b> to provide flexibility for the bushing mounting and to ensure alignment with the corresponding sleeves.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Well logging system <b>38</b> is designed for insertion through the interior passageway <b>74</b>, e.g. through the hollow interior <b>72</b> of electric submersible pumping system shaft <b>68</b>, for well logging operations below the electric submersible pumping system. In the embodiment illustrated, well logging system <b>38</b> comprises a logging plug <b>86</b> used to seal the production pressure against the well pressure during logging processes. Logging plug <b>86</b> effectively becomes a seal mechanism between the logging system <b>38</b> and the surrounding component, e.g. submersible pump <b>48</b>. By way of example, the logging plug <b>86</b> may utilize a seal <b>88</b>, such as a V-pack seal, to seal against the inside diameter of pump head <b>52</b>. Logging plug <b>86</b> further comprises an upper portion <b>90</b> coupled to wireline <b>46</b> and a lower portion <b>92</b> connected to a wireline guard <b>94</b>. Wireline guard <b>94</b> hangs from logging plug <b>86</b> and may extend through the entire length of well components <b>36</b>, e.g. electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>. By way of example, the wireline guard <b>94</b> may be made of a wear resistant, non-galling metal to prevent damage to wireline <b>46</b>. Additionally, the wireline guard can be split into sections of convenient length to facilitate assembly onto wireline <b>46</b> at wellhead <b>26</b>. The wireline guard sections are joined by couplings <b>96</b> to protect the wireline over the entire length of shaft <b>68</b>. The couplings <b>96</b> also can be used to provide a bearing surface for isolating the wireline guard <b>94</b> from the internal wall of shaft <b>68</b>. In this embodiment, couplings <b>96</b> are made of a sacrificial material able to protect the wireline guard <b>94</b> during logging processes without damaging the interior of shaft <b>68</b>. By way of example, wireline guard <b>94</b> may be formed as sections of pipe with the wireline inserted. However, if the wireline guard <b>94</b> is longer than the maximum displacement of the elevator (not shown) used in deploying the system, other styles of wireline guard <b>94</b> and other installation techniques can be used. For example, the wireline guard <b>94</b> can be formed as a split pipe or as a pipe with an axial or spiral groove <b>97</b>. The split/grooved pipe enables side installation of wireline <b>46</b> on, for example, the rig floor while the wireline extends into the well.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a latching mechanism <b>98</b> is used to latch logging plug <b>86</b> to pump head <b>52</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, logging plug <b>86</b> comprises one or more anti-rotation pins <b>100</b> that extended generally radially outward for engagement with a pin guide <b>102</b>, such as a mule shoe, that forms part of pump head <b>52</b>. Pin guide <b>102</b> includes a guide surface <b>104</b> that may comprise various geometries designed to guide pins <b>100</b> into a corresponding retention mechanism <b>106</b> having retention slots <b>108</b>. Retention mechanism <b>106</b> further comprises retention fingers <b>110</b>, such as beam-spring fingers, designed to maintain pins <b>100</b> in retention slots <b>108</b> during logging processes. The fingers <b>110</b> also provide predictability with respect to the forces required when pushing plug <b>86</b> into or pulling plug <b>86</b> out of retention slots <b>108</b>. The retention fingers <b>110</b> also prevent logging plug <b>86</b> from moving backwards, e.g. in an upward direction, during logging processes. When pins <b>100</b> are engaged with retention slots <b>108</b>, the logging plug <b>86</b> is prevented from rotating during the logging processes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Upon completion of the desired logging processes, well logging tool <b>44</b> and wireline <b>46</b> can be withdrawn through hollow interior <b>72</b> of shaft <b>68</b>. A production plug <b>112</b> can be used to plug the hollow shaft <b>68</b> during normal, non-logging operation of electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The production plug <b>112</b> may be made with a latching mechanism guide <b>114</b>, similar to the latching mechanism pin guide <b>98</b> for receiving logging plug <b>86</b>. Latching mechanism guide <b>114</b> comprises a guide surface <b>116</b> for guiding one or more pins <b>118</b> that extend outwardly from production plug <b>112</b>. Retention fingers <b>120</b> can be used to hold pins <b>118</b> and to retain production plug <b>112</b> at the end of the hollow shaft <b>68</b> during normal, non-logging operations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, a trip saver mechanism <b>122</b> can be used instead of production plug <b>112</b>, as illustrated by the dashed lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, trip saver mechanism <b>122</b> is used to seal shaft <b>68</b> without requiring an additional trip downhole to move production plug <b>112</b> into latching mechanism <b>114</b>. In one example, trip saver mechanism <b>122</b> comprises a valve <b>124</b>, such as a flapper valve similar to flapper valves used in safety valves. The valve <b>124</b> is normally closed during non-logging production of well fluid, but the valve is activated to an open position, as illustrated, during logging processes. The valve can be opened via hydraulic or mechanical actuation similar to conventional flapper valves, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When well components <b>36</b> comprise electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>, additional pump related components are integrated into the system, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a portion of electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b> is illustrated as showing motor protector <b>54</b> and submersible motor <b>50</b>. Submersible motor <b>50</b> may be constructed similar to conventional submersible motors utilized in electric submersible pumping systems. For example, submersible motor <b>50</b> may be constructed with conventional rotor and stator sections <b>126</b> combined with conductors that are connected by end coils <b>128</b> all located within an outer housing <b>129</b>. However, submersible motor <b>50</b> is designed to accommodate log-through procedures by virtue of its hollow shaft section <b>70</b> that forms part of overall hollow shaft <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Similarly, motor protector <b>54</b> also incorporates its own hollow shaft section <b>70</b> that forms part of overall hollow shaft <b>68</b>. The hollow shaft sections <b>70</b> of submersible motor <b>50</b> and motor protector <b>54</b> are connected by a sealed shaft coupling <b>130</b> having a plurality of seals <b>132</b> that seal the coupling <b>130</b> to prevent exposure of the motor oil within submersible motor <b>50</b> to well fluid or contaminants within hollow shaft <b>68</b>. A similar sealed shaft coupling <b>133</b> can be used to connect the hollow shaft section of motor protector <b>54</b> with submersible pump <b>48</b>. Apart from its hollow shaft section <b>70</b> for accommodating log-through procedures, motor protector <b>54</b> can be constructed according to a variety of conventional motor protector designs. For example, the motor protector <b>54</b> may be constructed with one or more bag sections <b>134</b> and/or one or more labyrinth sections <b>136</b> located within an outer motor protector housing <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As with submersible pump <b>48</b>, logging system <b>38</b> can be moved along the hollow interior <b>72</b> of shaft <b>68</b> in both motor protector <b>54</b> and submersible motor <b>50</b>. The hollow interior through motor protector <b>54</b> and submersible motor <b>50</b> accommodates the passage of well logging tool <b>44</b> and wireline <b>46</b>. As discussed above, the wireline <b>46</b> can be protected by sections of wireline guard <b>94</b> connected together by couplings <b>96</b>. The couplings <b>96</b> further serve as bearings within motor protector <b>54</b> and submersible motor <b>50</b> to provide a bearing surface that isolates wireline guard <b>94</b> from the inside surface of the hollow shaft section <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, lower motor protector <b>56</b> can be connected below submersible motor <b>50</b> and comprises its own hollow shaft section <b>70</b> connected to the hollow shaft section <b>70</b> of submersible motor <b>50</b> by a sealed shaft coupling <b>138</b>. The lower motor protector <b>56</b> can be constructed according to a variety of designs with numerous combinations of motor protector sections and components. By way of example, lower motor protector <b>56</b> may be designed as a bag-type protector having one or more bag sections <b>140</b> located within an outer protector housing <b>141</b>. However, the bag sections in the lower protector <b>56</b> can be designed with smaller bags than those used in motor protector <b>54</b>. The lower protector <b>56</b> also can be designed with a thrust bearing <b>142</b> to counteract forces acting on shaft <b>68</b> during operation of electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>. Lower protector <b>56</b> also may incorporate other features found in conventional motor protectors, such as relief valves <b>144</b> and breathing paths <b>146</b>. However, a pathway <b>148</b> normally extending between bag sections <b>140</b> can be plugged or blocked when the motor protector is used as a lower motor protector in electric submersible pumping system <b>40</b>. Lower motor protector <b>56</b> also comprises a lower end <b>150</b> having a hollow interior <b>152</b> that may be smooth or that may comprise a threaded section <b>154</b> to enable the connection of additional equipment below lower motor protector <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The lower motor protector <b>56</b> further comprises redundant seals, such as redundant rotating mechanical face seals <b>156</b> positioned about shaft <b>68</b>. The shaft seals <b>156</b> and the flow paths <b>146</b> are arranged to prevent the static head of oil within submersible motor <b>50</b> and motor protector <b>54</b> from opening the shaft seals <b>156</b> and expelling oil while the well system <b>34</b> is suspended for installation into wellbore <b>22</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the two upper shaft seals <b>156</b> are inverted to resist the higher static pressure from the static head of oil. The lower shaft seal <b>156</b>, however, may be positioned in a standard motor protector orientation. In some embodiments, lower motor protector <b>56</b> can simply rely on a lower rotary shaft seal <b>156</b> to isolate the motor oil from the well fluid. The use of an oil compensation system, such as bag sections <b>140</b>, may not be necessary if motor protector <b>54</b> has a sufficient system to fully compensate for changes in motor oil volume.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As with submersible pump <b>48</b>, motor protector <b>54</b>, and submersible motor <b>50</b>, logging system <b>38</b> can be moved along the hollow interior <b>72</b> of shaft <b>68</b> in lower motor protector <b>56</b>. The hollow interior through lower motor protector <b>56</b> accommodates the passage of well logging tool <b>44</b> and wireline <b>46</b>. Again, the wireline <b>46</b> can be protected by sections of wireline guard <b>94</b> connected together by couplings <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Specific components used in well system <b>34</b> can vary depending on the actual well application for which they are used. The location and orientation of the longitudinal interior passageway <b>74</b> can be adjusted depending on the type of well components used in a given application. If the well system comprises an electric submersible pumping system, the design and arrangement of the pumping system components can vary. For example, a variety of sections, such as bag sections and labyrinth sections, can be incorporated into the motor protectors. Additionally, the number and arrangement of submersible pumps, submersible motors and motor protectors can be adjusted to the specific well environment, well application and production requirements. Other components can be attached to, or formed as part of, the electric submersible pumping system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this invention. Such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims.</p>
