<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a frame member suitable for use in the formation of, for example, door or window frames. In particular, the invention relates to a frame member incorporating a thermal break to enhance the thermal insulating properties of the frame member.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known to produce insulated frame members from an extruded material shaped to define a channel by pouring a suitable resin into the channel, allowing the resin to cure and then removing the material from the base of the channel, for example by milling such that the final product has the appearance of two separate extruded members interconnected by the resin. In order to meet current thermal insulating regulations, the thermal break has to be fairly wide and problems have been experienced in trying to remove the necessary width of material from the extrusion in an economic manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another known technique involves taking two separate frame components, interconnecting them using a thermally insulating connector and then applying a resin material to a channel defined by the two frame components and the connector. It is an object of the invention to provide enhancements to such a technique.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an insulated frame member comprising first and second frame components interconnected by first and second thermally insulating connectors, each connector defining, with the first and second frame components, a channel containing a resin material, the connectors being off-set from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The provision of offset thermal breaks allows for greater freedom in the design of window and door frames. Such off-setting could not be achieved with prior arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conveniently the connectors are push-fitted to the frame components. Such an arrangement allows for a degree of movement to occur between the frame components and the connectors accommodating, for example, shrinkage of the resin which may occur during curing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The connectors conveniently include hollow regions. Such arrangements are advantageous in that the thermal insulating properties of the connectors may be enhanced. Further, the cost and weight of the connectors can be reduced. Conveniently the connectors include connector regions adapted to be push-fitted into corresponding recesses formed in the frame components, the connector regions being hollow and defining locations into which screws can be secured. The use of the connector regions in this manner means that separate screw locations do not need to be provided on the frame components. The use of the hollows in the connector regions ensures that the integrity of the thermal break is not impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention also relates to a connector suitable for use in an insulated frame member and comprising a pair of projections adapted to be push-fitted into corresponding formations provided on respective frame components, at least one of the projections being hollow and defining a location into which a screw can be secured.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> there is shown a frame member <b>10</b> which comprises a first extruded aluminium frame component <b>12</b> which is secured to a second extruded aluminium frame component <b>14</b>. The first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, when assembled to one another define a frame member of generally rectangular cross-section intended for use in the manufacture of an aluminium window or door frame. Each of the frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> includes an angled wall <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The walls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> being arranged to extend generally parallel to one another in the assembled frame member <b>10</b> but to be angled to the front and side walls of the frame member. The frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are also shaped to define channels <b>20</b>, each channel <b>20</b> of the first frame components <b>12</b> lying opposite a corresponding one of the channels <b>20</b> of the second frame component.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The channels <b>20</b> of the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are dimensioned to receive connector regions <b>22</b> of first and second connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The fit of the connector regions <b>22</b> in the channels <b>20</b> is such as to allow the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to be push-fitted or press-fitted to the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, during the assembly of the frame member <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> defines, with the adjacent parts of the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, a respective channel <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> which is filled with a suitable resin material <b>32</b>, the resin material <b>32</b>, when cured, serving to permanently lock the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to one another, the resin material <b>32</b> in combination with the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> forming a thermal break between the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The assembly process used in the formation of the frame member <b>10</b> involves push-fitting the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. This is conveniently undertaken in a suitable jig, but it will be appreciated that other approaches may be taken to assemble the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and first and second connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Once the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have been secured to one another using the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, a suitable resin material is poured into the channel <b>28</b> defined, in part, by the first frame component <b>24</b>. Once the resin material <b>32</b> in the channel <b>28</b> has cured, the frame component <b>10</b> is inverted to expose the channel <b>30</b>. After such inversion, resin material <b>32</b> is poured into the channel <b>30</b> and allowed to cure. Unlike the prior art technique for use in the formation of a thermal break in a frame member, there is no step of milling, grinding or otherwise removing a bridge region inter-connecting the first and second frame components.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> include angled walls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> which are arranged to face one another it will be appreciated that the first and second connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and associated regions filled with resin material <b>32</b> are offset relative to one another. Such offsetting allows a much greater freedom in the design of the frame member. For example, in the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one of the thermally insulated inter-connections between the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is located approximately midway along the width of the frame member <b>10</b>, the other inter-connection being located close to one edge of the frame member <b>10</b>. Prior art techniques for providing a thermal break in the frame member do not permit this.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first and second connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> conveniently take the form of a strip of an extruded plastics material. The connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are conveniently shaped to include hollow regions <b>34</b>. The provision of such hollow regions <b>34</b> is advantageous in that it reduces the quantity of material included in the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, consequently reducing the weight and cost of the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Additionally, the provision of the hollow regions <b>34</b> advantageously improves the thermal insulating properties of the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the connector regions <b>22</b> of the connectors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are also formed with hollow regions <b>36</b>. The provision of such hollow regions allows the connector regions <b>22</b> to compress, if necessary, during the push-fitting operation thereby accommodating any variations in the widths of the channels <b>20</b> which may occur during the extrusion of the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Ribs <b>38</b> are provided on the connector regions <b>22</b>, the ribs <b>38</b> further serving to accommodate variations in channel width or the like, engagement of the ribs <b>38</b> in the channels <b>20</b> causing compression of the connector regions as mentioned hereinbefore. Additionally, the provision of the hollow regions <b>36</b> in the connector regions <b>22</b> allows the connector regions <b>22</b> to be used as locations into which screws may be secured during the subsequent assembly operation of a window or door frame using the frame member. By using the hollow regions <b>36</b> of the connector regions <b>22</b> in this manner, the provision of separate screw locations in the aluminium profiles of the first and second frame components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be avoided and this has manufacturing and cost benefits. The introduction of a screw into the hollow region <b>36</b> of the connector region <b>22</b> does not significantly impair the thermal insulating properties of the thermal break provided in the frame member <b>10</b>.</p>
