<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a door-stopping device for motor vehicles comprising a door holder bar, a support housing with a passage for the door holder bar to pass through and a locking unit provided in the support housing, comprising two pivotally mounted locking levers, each pre-tensioned by a spring element towards each other and towards the door holder bar, each locking lever comprising a locking element, the locking elements bearing on mutually opposite sides against the door holder bar and being adapted to engage with the locking grooves on the door holder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A door-stopping device is known from DE 201 20 271 U1, wherein a door holder bar, provided with locking grooves, is arranged pivotally on a vehicle body on the one hand, and in a displaceable manner in the support housing fitted to the vehicle door on the other hand. When the vehicle door is pivoted, a lateral face of the door holder bar provided with the locking grooves, slides from a rigid locking cam of the locking unit and, as a result, locks the vehicle door in predetermined opening positions. Opposite to the locking grooves, on the essentially plane side of the door holder bar, the latter is pressed towards the locking element by a spring-loaded cam.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This door-stopping device has the drawback that its function absolutely requires that the locking grooves must be oriented parallel to the pivoting axis of the door holder bar associated with the vehicle body, since a pivoting ability of the door holder bar is the prerequisite for the operation of the locking unit. This results in considerable structural limitations in the design of the stopping device as well as the associated components, i.e. the vehicle door and the fixing regions of the door holder bar on the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A door-stopping device of the type as set out in the opening paragraph is furthermore known from DE 297 17 283 U1. The locking levers are pre-tensioned by spring elements, whose ends opposite to the locking levers are supported inside the housing. In order to ensure the required support and in order to prevent deformations as a result of the supporting forces, the door-stopping device must be designed accordingly in the supporting region. This, however, entails considerable structural limitations as well as disadvantages with regard to weight.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is the object of the invention to provide a door-stopping device, which offers multiple possibilities of configuration, can be manufactured in a cost-effective manner and occupies only little space, while ensuring at the same time reliable stopping of the vehicle door associated with the door-stopping device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object according to the invention is attained by a door-stopping device with the characteristics of claim <b>1</b>. Advantageous further developments of the invention are stated in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The door-stopping device according to the invention is characterised in that the spring elements are arranged substantially parallel to the door holder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pivotal mounting of the locking levers co-acting with the door holder bar makes it possible to dispose the locking unit in any desired manner in the support housing independently of the pivoting axis of the door holder bar associated with the vehicle body. It is possible to provide the locking levers in such a manner that their pivoting axes extend parallel to the pivoting axis of the door holder bar associated with the vehicle body. Alternatively, the locking levers may also be so arranged that their pivoting axes extend normal to the pivoting axis of the door holder bar associated with the vehicle-body. It is important in this context that the locking elements interacting with the locking grooves are movable in relation to the door holder bar, so that a relative movement of the door holder bar in relation to the locking elements is not necessary for the function of the door-stopping device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The design according to the invention of the door-stopping device therefore offers great freedom of design when adapted to the respective vehicles and permits the minimisation of the space requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Minimising the space requirements is further aided by using the two separate spring elements, each of which pre-tensions a locking lever in the direction of the door holder bar. As a result, a complicated construction increasing space requirements, in which both locking levers are loaded by a single spring element, may be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further advantage of the design according to the invention resides in that&#x2014;in the event of the pivoting axes of the locking levers extending normal to the pivoting axis of the holding bar associated with the vehicle body&#x2014;the door holder bar is secured in its position formed by a plane normal to the pivoting axis of the door holder bar associated with the vehicle body, so that movements possibly damaging the bearings are reliably avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The disposition of the springs according to the invention makes it possible to configure the door-stopping device in a particularly small size, the space required for accommodating the locking levers already sufficing to provide suitable spring elements. In addition, the arrangement of the spring elements, essentially parallel to the door bar, offers the advantage that the ends of the spring elements opposite the locking elements are supported in a region of a housing of the door-stopping device, which corresponds to the region, which, in the position of installation of the door-stopping device, bears against the sheet metal behind it, for example the door panel. This permits a less solidly designed housing than is the case with the springs known in the state of the art, which are arranged normal to the door holder bar, as behind them, there is, for example, the door panel. The springs are aligned in the effective direction of a solid screw connection between housing and door panel. The door-stopping device may be manufactured to have a particularly low weight, is cost-effective and is small.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The spring elements may, in principle, be designed in any desired manner. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the elastic force of the spring elements may, however, be adjustable. This may take place by a regulating screw, which may be screwed into the support housing and from which the spring elements derives its support.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The adjustability of the elastic force makes it possible to compensate for possibly occurring material fatigue of the spring, so that a possibly required replacement of parts of the door-stopping device or the entire door-stopping device may be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The arrangement, orientation and design of the locking grooves on the door holder bar is, in principle, freely selectable. Apart from an arrangement, normally parallel to a pivoting axis of the door, of the locking grooves, as a rule, symmetrical in cross-section, it is also possible to dispose the locking grooves normal or at any desired angle to the pivoting axis. The individual locking grooves may in this context be identical or, according to a particularly advantageous further development of the invention, deviate from one another, so that in each case different operating forces are required in order to pivot the door. According to this further development, the possibilities of adaptation of the door-stopping device according to the invention are enhanced in a complementary manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, one or more locking grooves present an asymmetrical cross-section. This design extends the possibilities of design of the door-stopping device in a complementary manner, the asymmetrical configuration permitting the determination of different forces for opening and closing the door from the respective locking position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The advantageous designs of the locking grooves permit in particular to adapt the door-stopping device according to the invention to the most diverse structural specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a particularly advantageous further development of the invention, the locking elements comprise, at least in portions thereof, a circular cross-section while the locking grooves present a correspondingly arcuate shape. This embodiment of the invention ensures reliable stopping of the vehicle door in the opening positions of a vehicle door connected to the door-stopping device, predetermined by the arrangement of the locking grooves. At the same time, this design allows the respective locking positions to be left without unreasonably high force expenditure, it being possible, by means of the configuration of the locking grooves, to constructively determine the respective force expenditure and to adapt the latter to the respective vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Particularly advantageously, the locking elements are formed as an integral part of the locking levers. As a result, the number of required structural components for the door-stopping device and, consequently, the manufacturing costs may additionally be reduced. Alternatively, according to a further development of the invention, the locking element is formed by a roll provided rotatably on the locking lever. This embodiment additionally increases the functional safety and comfort when actuating the door-stopping device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For manufacturing the door-stopping device, any material meeting the required mechanical properties may, in principle, be used. However, according to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the locking levers and/or the locking elements are made of a plastics material having good sliding properties. The use of a suitable plastics material makes it possible, in comparison with door-stopping devices made from metallic materials, to additionally reduce the weight. The locking elements and/or locking levers made from plastics material having good sliding properties, ensure in this context that the occurring phenomena of wear and tear do not impair the function of the door-stopping device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For additional weight reduction, according to a further embodiment of the invention, the door holder bar is made from a metal bar coated with plastics while the support housing is manufactured from fibre-reinforced plastics, advantageously glass fibre-reinforced plastics. This combination is characterised by its high strength and low weight. In addition, by advantageously coating the metal bar with plastics, taking into account the coefficients of friction of the metal may be dispensed with when selecting the material of the door holder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The arrangement of the locking grooves as well as their number on the door holder bar is determined by the locking positions to be provided and may, in principle, be optionally selected. In the event of a vertically opposite arrangement of the locking grooves on the door holder bar, a particularly high locking moment is attained even with slight elastic forces, so that the selected spring elements may be designed particularly small.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Alternatively, it is however possible to arrange the locking grooves on the mutually opposite sides of the door holder bar in such a manner that the locking elements arranged opposite engage alternatingly with the locking grooves. This further development of the invention makes it possible to increase the number of locking positions in the pivoting angle region of the vehicle door. Possibly occurring instabilities of the locking arrangement may be countered by stronger spring elements or a different configuration of the locking grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In principle, the spring elements may in this context be freely selected. However, according to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, cylindrical coil compression springs are used to serve as spring elements. These are characterised by their high reliability and low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the door holder bar is designed, on the one hand, to be fixed to a vehicle body in an articulated manner and, on the other hand, comprises a stop device, a damping element being provided on the side of the stop device facing the support housing. This embodiment of the invention enhances the comfort of the door-stopping device in a complementary manner, the opening movement being damped when the limit stop is reached, i.e. when the maximum opening angle of the door is attained, resulting in the door not hitting the limit stop at full impact.</p>
