<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a support arm assembly and more particularly, to an adjustable support arm assembly, which allows easy adjustment of the tilt angle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A bracket or support arm assembly may be used and installed in a wall to hold a LCD TV, LCD monitor, satellite antenna, lighting fixture, video camera, advertising board, furniture, tool, etc. Conventional brackets or support arm assemblies for supporting an object on a wall do not allow the user to adjust the tilt angle of the object supported thereon. There are adjustable support arm assemblies that allow adjustment of the tilt angle of the object supported thereon. However, the adjustment procedure is complicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide an adjustable support arm assembly that allows easy adjustment of the tilt angle of the object supported thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, the adjustable support arm assembly comprises a holder frame affixed to a support, a mounting frame for supporting an object, a link, and two coupling structures respectively coupling two distal ends of the link to the holder frame and the mounting frame. Each coupling structure comprises a female coupling member, a male coupling member, a polygonal shaft, a cap, and a compression spring. The female coupling member comprises two circular coupling holes axially aligned, and a toothed portion extending around one end of the circular coupling holes. The male coupling member comprises a transversely extending polygonal coupling hole disposed between the two circular coupling holes of the female coupling member. The polygonal shaft is inserted through the circular coupling holes of the female coupling member and fitted into the polygonal coupling hole of the male coupling member, having a peripherally toothed head movable with the polygonal shaft between a locking position where the peripherally toothed head is engaged with the toothed portion of the female coupling member to lock the female coupling member to the male coupling member and an unlocking position where the peripherally toothed head is disengaged from the toothed portion of the female coupling member for allowing turning of the female coupling member about the polygonal shaft relative to the male coupling member. The cap is fixedly connected to one end of the polygonal shaft opposite to the peripherally toothed head. The compression spring is mounted on the polygonal shaft and stopped between the cap and the female coupling member to support the polygonal shaft in the locking position.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to the annexed drawings in detail, an adjustable support arm assembly in accordance with the present invention is shown comprised of a holder frame <b>1</b>, a link <b>2</b>, and a mounting frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The holder frame <b>1</b> is adapted to support a LCD TV, LCD monitor, satellite antenna, lighting fixture, video camera, advertising board, furniture, tool, etc. The mounting frame <b>3</b> is for fastening to a wall panel or support means. The link <b>2</b> can be formed of one single bar or a number of support arms coupled together for connection between the holder frame <b>1</b> and the mounting frame <b>3</b>. Male coupling members <b>5</b> and female coupling members <b>4</b> are respectively provided at the two distal ends of the link <b>2</b> and the bottom side of the holder frame <b>1</b> and the top side of the mounting frame <b>3</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1&#x2dc;3</figref>, a female coupling member <b>4</b> is respectively provided at the bottom side of the holder frame <b>1</b> and the bottom end of the link <b>2</b>, and a male coupling member <b>5</b> is respectively provided at the top side of the mounting frame <b>3</b> and the top end of the link <b>2</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, one female coupling member <b>4</b> and one male coupling member <b>5</b> are respectively provided at the two distal ends of the shell <b>20</b> to construct a long link <b>2</b>. One male coupling member <b>5</b> is connectable to one associating female coupling member <b>4</b>. After insertion of the male coupling member <b>5</b> into the associating female coupling member <b>4</b>, a polygonal shaft <b>6</b> is inserted through the aligned and transversely extending circular coupling holes <b>41</b> of the female coupling member <b>4</b> and the transversely extending polygonal coupling hole <b>51</b> of the male coupling member <b>5</b> to pivotally secure the female coupling member <b>4</b> to the associating male coupling member <b>5</b>. The polygonal shaft <b>6</b> has one end fixedly provided with a peripherally toothed head <b>60</b> for engaging a toothed portion <b>40</b> in the female coupling member <b>4</b> to lock the female coupling member <b>4</b> to the associating male coupling member <b>5</b>, and the other end fixedly mounted with a cap <b>8</b>. Further, a compression spring <b>9</b> is mounted on the polygonal shaft <b>6</b> and stopped between the female coupling member <b>4</b> and the cap <b>8</b> to impart an outward pressure to the cap <b>8</b>, causing the cap <b>8</b> to pull the polygonal shaft <b>6</b> in direction toward the inside of the female coupling member <b>4</b>, and therefore the peripherally toothed head <b>60</b> is kept in engagement with the toothed portion <b>40</b> of the female coupling member <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, a mounting assembly <b>10</b> may be provided at the top side of the holder frame <b>1</b> for mounting. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4&#x2dc;7</figref>, the mounting assembly <b>10</b> comprises a mounting shaft <b>13</b> having a peripherally toothed mounting slot <b>14</b>, a clamping plate <b>11</b> inserted through and movable along the peripherally toothed mounting slot <b>14</b> and having an engagement block <b>12</b> for engaging the toothed portion of the peripherally toothed mounting slot <b>14</b>, and a lock screw <b>15</b> mounted in the clamping plate <b>11</b> for locking the clamping plate <b>11</b> to the mounting shaft <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During application, the mounting frame <b>3</b> is affixed to a wall panel, and the object to be supported is mounted on the holder frame <b>1</b> or fastened to the mounting assembly <b>10</b> at the holder frame <b>1</b>. When adjusting the tilt angle of the supported object, hold the supported object with one hand and then press the cap <b>8</b> against the compression spring <b>9</b> with the other hand to disengage the peripherally toothed head <b>60</b> from the toothed portion <b>40</b> of the female coupling member <b>4</b>, and then move the supported object to the desired angle. After adjustment, release the hand from the cap <b>8</b>, and the spring force of the compression spring <b>9</b> immediately forces the peripherally toothed head <b>60</b> into engagement with the toothed portion <b>40</b> of the female coupling member <b>4</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
