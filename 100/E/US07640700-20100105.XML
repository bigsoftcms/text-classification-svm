<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A composite wall panel having continuous upper and lower hollow horizontal chases and spaced hollow studs forming vertical chases throughout the panel to permit passage of electrical wiring and the like. The chases have protective barriers to protect the wiring from penetration and damage due to mechanical fasteners used to manufacture the panel and to construct load bearing walls using a plurality of manufactured panels. Further, the panel has a continuous header to provide structural rigidity and to permit rapid manufacturing of the panel without the need to frame openings, such as doors and windows, at the time of manufacture. Openings are cut in the panels and finished after the walls are constructed. Even further, the panel has horizontally extending brackets which laterally support the studs.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to composite wall systems for modular construction. More particularly the invention relates to formation of chases for services, vertically and horizontally, within the structural elements of the wall system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional wisdom in construction techniques has been to remain with tried, tested and true materials and methodologies. Accordingly, conventional wall frame construction continues to utilize either 2&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; or 2&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; construction in either a stick framing or a unit framing technique. Additionally, stressed-skin panels have been introduced in which two sheets of building material are sandwiched together about a foam core to provide insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In stick frame construction, a wall is generally built in place, using a framework of repeating, evenly spaced wall studs. At openings, such as windows and doors, a custom framework is constructed, including a lintel over the opening, to ensure structural integrity above and across any openings.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In unit framing construction, a wall structure, including lintels and frames about predetermined openings, is built as a complete unit on a pre-constructed floor structure and the unit is then erected into place by standing it up and fastening it, at a base, to the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In stressed skin construction, individual panels are laid out at the construction site. The structure comprises an assembly of panels which can be cut or stacked to whatever height is required. Typically, panels are available as 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; or 3&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; panels. Most often, conventional construction utilizes panels in 4&#x2032; lengths by 8&#x2032; heights. The panels are manufactured having a variety of thicknesses of insulation core, depending upon the desired degree of insulation, creating panels that are the equivalent of conventional 2&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; or 2&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; beam lumber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Using any of the aforementioned conventional techniques requires skilled laborers, sophisticated equipment and considerable time to assemble and erect a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Modular systems exist which attempt to overcome the problems related to conventional construction techniques. One such system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,068,434 to Day et al. which utilizes wall panels having inner and outer skins or wood sheeting material adhesively bonded on opposite sides of a core of rigid expanded foam material. An integral, horizontal beam having greater vertical height than width is adhesively bonded horizontally at the top of the wall unit from one end of the wall to the other to provide structural rigidity. In one alternate embodiment, Day provides a plurality of vertical wood furring strips which are adhesively bonded to the inner facing of the wall unit for strengthening the wall and to provide an air space between the wall and finishing panels. Periodic notches are formed across the furring strips for passing wiring. In essence, Day's wall panel utilizes a first structural wall panel, bonded together with adhesives and having a second false wall forming an air gap and wiring access. The structure of Day's panels requires that the wiring be installed before the finishing, typically drywall or sheetrock, is applied. If wiring is not installed prior to installation, subsequent fishing of wiring through the sheeted panel is unsupported and unguided either horizontally through notches between the furring strips or vertically in the spaces created between the furring strips.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of adhesively assembled wall panels has not yet been approved under many building codes. In Canada, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) negatively views the use of any laminates or adhesive bonding that are exposed to the environment. Specifically, known disadvantages of adhesive bonding include de-lamination of the bond when exposed to the elements. It is uncertain how long the bond will hold and thus CMHC believes that it is risky to use where structural integrity is required for an extended time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,940 to Carlin et al. teaches a composite wall panel having a polymer foam core, sandwiched by opposing wall surfaces and having at least one light metal gauge hollow stud in the body of the wall, the foam extending into the center of the stud to secure the stud to the body. No provision is made in the panel for electrical services. Wiring can be passed through holes in the metal studs to extend vertically through the panel, however, the insulation must be removed to permit wiring to extend horizontally through the panel. Open channels at the top and bottom of the wall panel are utilized for affixing the panel to the floor and to the roof and as such are compromised by fasteners extending through the channels making them incompatible with standard electrical wiring. Armor jacketed cable that is impervious to fasteners is required, which adds to the overall expense and man hours required.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,708 to Taraba et al. teaches a structural foam core panel with a built-in header. While providing load carrying support above openings formed in the panel, the header does not provide a passage for electrical services and the like. Passages must be grooved in the insulation prior to sheeting in order to pass wiring therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If is also recognized that in geographical areas prone to hurricanes, it is desirable for a composite wall panel to have structure that further enhances resistance to damage by high winds, such as with hurricanes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is a demonstrated need to provide a modular wall system having readily accessible conduits for providing services integrated within the structural elements of the wall, which is resistant to wind damage, and which is securely assembled by either adhesive or mechanical fastening means. Further, when mechanical fastening means are used, the wall should protect the services from such mechanical fastening means extending into the structural elements during construction. Even further, the wall should be easily installed and affixed to adjacent walls, floors and roof members so as to provide a system for construction that requires a minimum of skill, time and equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A composite panel incorporates a horizontally extending hollow load bearing header having hollow studs spaced at intervals throughout the width of the panel. The hollow header and hollow studs form horizontal and vertical chases for accommodating utilities such as wiring, cabling and conduit. Holes are formed in the horizontal chase coincident with the vertical chases to permit communication therebetween. The utilities are protected from damage as a result of penetration by mechanical fasteners used to assemble the panels into wall structures. Protective barrier members are positioned within the hollow chases, leaving a core open for the passage of the utilities. Further, the header provides structural rigidity and enables one to provide door and window penetrations substantially anywhere in the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The panel is insulated between the spaced studs and has sheeting material affixed on opposing sides. Preferably, an inner surface of the interior layer of sheeting is finished with a layer of finishing material such as drywall or paper which acts as an air barrier and an aesthetic finish.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the base of the panel further comprises a second hollow horizontal chase and the chase is similarly protected by protective barrier members. More preferably, the second hollow chase is formed by a downward facing U-shaped wall base fitting attached to a bottom of the panel which cooperates with an upward facing U-shaped base plate which is adapted for attachment to a floor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The studs are laterally supported by an upper bracket attached to the header and a lower bracket attached to the base, whereby the upper and lower brackets respectively fit over top and bottom portions of the studs. Preferably, the brackets are U-shaped, thereby providing lateral support to both sides of the top and bottom portions of the studs. Holes are formed in the upper and lower brackets contiguous with holes in the header and base, as necessary, to permit utilities to pass therethrough. The brackets are attached using mechanical fasteners, such as screws, and the mechanical fasteners are oriented to provide minimum interference with utilities and to permit ready assembly of the wall panel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Panels of the invention are used to form load bearing wall structures. Particularly, panels are provided with nailing strips as a result of sheeting material extending beyond a width of the panel. The nailing strip can be removed from a first panel which is placed perpendicular to the nailing strip of a second panel for forming a corner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the broadest aspect of the invention a composite wall panel comprises: a base extending horizontally at a bottom of the panel and adapted for attachment to a floor structure; a continuous hollow header extending horizontally at a top of the panel, the hollow header defining an upper horizontally extending chase for passage of services therethrough; a plurality of vertically extending, hollow studs spaced at intervals intermediate a length of the panel so as to space the base from the header for forming a frame, the hollow studs defining a plurality of vertically extending chases for communication with the upper horizontally extending chase; upper and lower horizontally extending brackets, the upper bracket attached to a bottom surface of the header and having at least one downward facing side, the upper bracket adapted to permit communication between the upper horizontally extending chase and the vertically extending chase, the lower bracket attached to a top surface of the base and having at least one upward facing side, the hollow studs positioned between the upper and lower brackets and laterally supported by the at least one downward facing side and the at least one upward facing side; insulating material positioned intermediate the spaced studs; and opposing layers of sheeting material affixed to opposing surfaces of the frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a composite wall panel <b>1</b> is used to form at least a portion of a substantially rectangular structural wall <b>2</b> having opposing planar surfaces <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, one of which may be exposed to the environment. The panel <b>1</b> comprises a hollow header <b>5</b> formed horizontally across a top <b>6</b> of the panel <b>1</b> and a base <b>7</b> formed horizontally across a bottom <b>8</b> of the panel <b>1</b> for attaching to an existing floor structure (not shown). The hollow header <b>5</b> is spaced from the base <b>7</b> by a plurality of hollow studs <b>9</b> positioned at intervals intermediate a width &#x201c;w&#x201d; of the panel, forming a frame <b>10</b>. Sheeting material <b>11</b> is affixed to the frame <b>10</b> on the opposing planer surfaces <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> for forming the panel <b>1</b>. Once sheeted, the panel <b>1</b> has limited access therein for the installation of utilities <b>12</b> such as wire, cabling and conduit. The hollow header <b>5</b> and studs <b>9</b> form vertical chases &#x201c;VC&#x201d; and an upper horizontal chase &#x201c;UC&#x201d; which can communicate with each other so as to enable ready installation of the utilities <b>12</b> throughout the panel <b>1</b>. Optionally, a wall base fitting <b>13</b> in combination with a complementary base plate <b>14</b>, can used to form a hollow base <b>15</b> to be employed as a second and lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d;, at the bottom <b>8</b> of the panel, for interconnection with the vertical chases &#x201c;VC&#x201d; in the studs <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, in one embodiment, sheeting material <b>11</b> is affixed using mechanical fasteners <b>21</b>. Mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> are prevented from interfering with utilities <b>12</b> which are routed through the hollow portions <b>22</b> of each vertical chase &#x201c;VC&#x201d; by a protective barrier member <b>23</b> positioned in each vertical chase &#x201c;VC&#x201d; adjacent at least the external planar surface <b>20</b> of the wall <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In greater detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the studs <b>9</b> are hollow, creating vertical chases &#x201c;VC&#x201d; to permit passing electrical wiring <b>12</b> and the like therethrough. The studs <b>9</b> are typically rectangular having a width portion <b>30</b> narrower than a depth <b>31</b>, the planar surfaces <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> of the wall <b>2</b> being attached to opposing narrower width portions <b>30</b> of the stud <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, openings <b>32</b> are drilled in the upper horizontal chase &#x201c;UC&#x201d;, coincident with hollow centers of the studs <b>9</b>, when required to permit communication between the vertical chase &#x201c;VC&#x201d; in the stud <b>9</b> and the upper horizontal chase &#x201c;UC&#x201d; for running electrical wiring and the like. Similarly, if a hollow lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; is formed, communicating openings may be drilled in the lower chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; as well.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">More particularly, the hollow studs <b>9</b> are formed of two vertically extending shaped members <b>33</b>,<b>34</b> which interlock to define a hollow core <b>35</b> while providing structural rigidity. One form of shaped members <b>33</b>,<b>34</b> are cooperating shapes of the same profile which interlock when mated with mirrored shaped members <b>33</b>,<b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A protective barrier member <b>23</b> is positioned inside the hollow core <b>35</b> of each stud <b>9</b> adjacent at least one of the narrow width portions <b>30</b> of the stud <b>9</b> adjacent the planar surfaces <b>3</b>,<b>4</b>. The protective barrier member <b>23</b> is a vertically extending length of material, preferably polystyrene insulation, which is sized so as to fit the narrow width portion <b>30</b> of the stud <b>9</b> while leaving the remainder of the core <b>35</b> open for passage of wiring and the like, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Placement of the barrier member <b>23</b> provides protection for services <b>12</b> passing through the stud <b>9</b> from the intrusive mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> used to attach sheeting material <b>11</b> and the like to the frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Having reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the hollow header <b>5</b> is a continuous hollow composite header formed atop the hollow studs <b>9</b> and extending horizontally substantially the entire width w of the panel <b>1</b> to add structural rigidity, load bearing capability, as well as providing the upper horizontal chase &#x201c;UC&#x201d; for accommodating electrical wiring and the like. The continuous header <b>5</b> also permits panels <b>1</b> to be formed having a greater width than height, allowing structures to be built using a minimum number of panels <b>1</b> and preferably built using a single panel <b>1</b> to form a wall <b>2</b>. Openings <b>16</b> for windows and doors can be formed in the panel <b>1</b> after manufacturing, as a result of the strength provided by the continuous header <b>5</b>, thus allowing rapid and efficient constructions of the panels <b>1</b> without the need to plan openings at the time of manufacture. Preferably, a nailing strip <b>17</b> is added around the openings <b>16</b> to maintain the integrity of the wall panel <b>1</b> once the openings are cut. More preferably, the nailing strips <b>17</b> are formed of U-shaped cap material <b>73</b>, described later.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the header <b>5</b> is comprised of a bottom rail <b>40</b> and a top rail <b>41</b>. The rails <b>40</b>,<b>41</b> are vertically spaced apart from one another in parallel arrangement by horizontally extending and laterally opposing spacing members <b>42</b>,<b>43</b> positioned therebetween, thus forming a rectangular hollow beam <b>44</b> having a hollow core <b>47</b>. Preferably, the bottom and top rails <b>40</b>,<b>41</b> are wood and the opposing spacing members <b>42</b>,<b>43</b> are sheeting material <b>11</b>. More preferably the spacing members <b>42</b>,<b>43</b> are offset inwardly so that a layer of insulation <b>45</b>, such as polystyrene or polyurethane, is affixed to outward facing surfaces <b>46</b> of the opposing spacing members <b>42</b>,<b>43</b> for providing insulation about the hollow core <b>47</b> of the header <b>5</b>. Holes <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are drilled in the bottom rail <b>41</b> of the header <b>5</b>, coincident to the core <b>35</b> of the studs <b>9</b>, when required, to permit communication between the upper horizontal chase &#x201c;UC&#x201d; in the header <b>5</b> and the vertical chases &#x201c;VC&#x201d; in the studs <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Having reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and in another embodiment of the invention, the panel <b>1</b> has a hollow lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; formed at the bottom <b>8</b> of the panel <b>1</b>. Best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a downward facing U-shaped wall base fitting <b>50</b> is attached to the bottom <b>8</b> of the panel <b>1</b> for forming the base <b>7</b> of the panel <b>1</b>. The panel <b>1</b> is supported on the existing floor (not shown) by placing the U-shaped wall base fitting <b>50</b> over an upward facing U-shaped base plate <b>51</b>, attached to a floor surface. The combined U-shaped wall base fitting <b>50</b> and U-shaped base plate <b>51</b> form the rectangular hollow lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d;. At least one vertical edge <b>52</b> of the lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; is fitted with a horizontally extending protective barrier member, preferably polystyrene or polyurethane insulation, to protect the wiring and the like from damage caused by protruding mechanical fasteners used to affix sheeting to at least one of the planar surfaces of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the U-shaped base plate <b>51</b> and wall base fitting <b>50</b> are made of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sheeting material <b>11</b> attached to opposing planar surfaces <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> of the frame is typically available in 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2033; sheets and is fastened to the studs <b>9</b>, using either mechanical fasteners <b>21</b>, such as screws, or an adhesive. If the surface <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> is to be exposed to the elements, such as an external wall surface <b>20</b>, the sheeting <b>11</b> is affixed using mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> and the studs <b>9</b> and lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; are appropriately fitted with protective barrier members <b>23</b>, as previously described. The sheeting material <b>11</b> is attached to extend vertically sufficient to cover the U shaped wall base fitting <b>50</b> at the bottom <b>8</b> of the wall <b>2</b> and the header <b>5</b> at the top <b>6</b> of the wall <b>2</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the external layer <b>20</b> of sheeting material <b>11</b> is permitted to extend beyond the width w of the panel <b>1</b> creating a nailing strip <b>60</b> to facilitate assembly to an adjacent panel <b>1</b><i>a </i>to create a corner <b>61</b> of a structure <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Rigid foam insulation <b>70</b>, such as polystyrene or polyurethane insulation, is sandwiched between the opposing layers <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> of sheeting material <b>11</b> and from the header <b>5</b> to the lower horizontal chase &#x201c;LC&#x201d; to act as a vapor barrier. Poly-sheeting may be added, where required by code, to further act as a vapor barrier. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at opposing ends <b>71</b>,<b>72</b> of the wall <b>2</b>, a vertically extending U-shaped cap member <b>73</b> is positioned about an end <b>74</b> of the insulation <b>70</b> to sandwich the insulation <b>70</b> between the cap <b>73</b> and an adjacent stud <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, when two adjacent wall panels <b>1</b>, <b>1</b><i>a </i>are placed perpendicular to one another to form a corner <b>61</b>, the nailing strip (shown removed) of a first wall panel <b>1</b><i>a </i>is removed. The remaining nailing strip <b>60</b> of a second wall panel <b>1</b> is affixed to the U-shaped cap <b>73</b> of the adjacent first wall panel <b>1</b><i>a </i>using mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> which penetrate the sheeting material <b>11</b> and the U-shaped cap <b>73</b> and embed into the insulation <b>70</b> of the adjacent panel <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably and having reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a layer of finishing material <b>80</b> such as drywall or paper, which acts as an air barrier and an aesthetic finishing, is affixed to an inner surface <b>81</b> of an interior layer <b>82</b> of the sheeting material <b>11</b>. The finishing material <b>80</b> can be either mechanically fastened or can be adhesively bonded or laminated to the interior layer <b>82</b> of sheeting material <b>11</b> as the inner surface <b>81</b> of the wall panel <b>1</b> is not exposed to the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the sheeting material <b>11</b> is oriented strand board (OSB) and the finishing material <b>80</b> is drywall.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exterior load bearing wall <b>90</b> of a structure is formed using a plurality of adjacent composite wall panels <b>1</b>, <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the present invention. Linear sections of base plate <b>51</b>, fitted with protective barrier members <b>23</b> are affixed to a floor surface <b>91</b>, such as concrete, using mechanical fasteners <b>21</b>. U-shaped wall base fittings <b>50</b> attached to a bottom <b>8</b> are affixed over the base plates <b>51</b>, as previously described, to form the exterior load bearing wall <b>90</b> of the structure. Wiring for electrical, communications and the like <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are run through the upper and lower horizontal chases &#x201c;UC&#x201d; &#x201c;LC&#x201d; and holes <b>32</b> are drilled to access the vertical chases &#x201c;VC&#x201d;, as required, to permit customizing of the locations of outlets <b>100</b> along the wall <b>90</b>. Openings <b>16</b> are cut through the panels <b>1</b>, below the header <b>5</b>, to form windows and doors at desired locations and are finished in a conventional manner. The remainder of the structure, such as the roof, is completed using conventional construction techniques. A finishing is applied to the outer surface of the external layer <b>20</b> of sheeting material <b>11</b> as required. Such finishing may be a siding material, a concrete material, or another suitable finishing chosen to meet or exceed local building codes.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for use in geographical areas that are prone to hurricanes, the header <b>5</b> may be constructed using laminated beams, such as beams formed of microlaminated material, in place of traditional wooden lumber and the roof trusses <b>101</b> may be joined to the header <b>5</b> using metal fasteners <b>102</b> that securely attach the truss <b>101</b> to the header <b>5</b> to reduce the danger of the roof structure lifting as a result of the high winds. Preferably, the fastener <b>102</b> has a downward depending planar surface <b>103</b> that is affixed to a vertical surface <b>104</b> of the header <b>5</b> and a cradle <b>105</b> which supports the truss <b>101</b> and can be affixed to the truss <b>101</b> on opposing sides.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, to increase lateral strength of the composite wall panel <b>1</b>, upper and lower U-shaped brackets are used <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. The upper bracket <b>110</b> is attached to the bottom surface <b>114</b> of the bottom rail <b>40</b> of the header <b>5</b> and has opposing downward facing sides <b>115</b>. The lower bracket <b>112</b> is attached to the top surface <b>116</b> of the base <b>7</b> and has opposing upward facing sides <b>117</b>. The studs <b>9</b> are fit between the upper and lower brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, with the sides <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> of the brackets overlapping a portion thereof. The sides <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> of the brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> provide lateral support for the studs <b>9</b>, while the base <b>7</b>, studs <b>9</b>, insulating material <b>70</b>, header <b>5</b>, and brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> form an integral unit, thereby providing a composite wall panel that is resistant to failure by high shear forces, such as hurricane winds. Furthermore, this arrangement permits the use of either mechanical fasteners or adhesive as means for affixing the sheeting material <b>11</b> (not shown) to the frame <b>10</b> without compromising the structural integrity of the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While as shown, the brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are U-shaped, the brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can also be an L-shape, with either a single bracket or a pair of opposing brackets being used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In any case, the brackets are adapted to permit the routing of utilities therethrough, such as by holes contiguous with the holes <b>32</b> in the bottom rail <b>40</b> of the header <b>5</b>. In other words, when the brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are used, the vertically extending chases remain in communication with the upper and lower horizontally extending chases UC, LC.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The brackets <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are attached to the header <b>5</b> and the base <b>7</b> by mechanical fasteners <b>21</b>, such as screws. Preferably, the mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> are positioned between the hollow studs <b>9</b> and do not substantially protrude into the upper and lower chases UC, LC so as to not interfere with utilities running therethrough. In one embodiment, to assemble the panel <b>1</b>, one or more upward facing mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> attach the wall base fitting <b>50</b> to the lower bracket <b>112</b>, while one or more upward facing mechanical fasteners <b>21</b> attach the upper bracket <b>110</b> to the bottom rail <b>40</b> of the header <b>5</b>. To complete assembly, the base fitting <b>50</b> is fit over the base plate <b>51</b>, one end of each of the studs <b>9</b> and, optionally, insulating material <b>70</b>, is fit into the lower bracket <b>112</b>, and the upper bracket <b>110</b> is fit over the other end of each of the studs <b>9</b> and insulating material. U-shaped caps <b>73</b>, <b>74</b> may also be positioned at the ends of the panel <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The sheeting material <b>11</b> is then affixed to the frame <b>10</b> and other finishing material <b>80</b> added as desired.</p>
