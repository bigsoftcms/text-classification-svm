<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to tubular lock mechanisms and, more specifically, to such lock mechanisms as which incorporates an adjustable backset. More particularly, the present invention discloses an improved backset assembly incorporating modified inner and outer casing parts, as well as a novel &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped hook portion associated with a sandwichingly disposed actuating plate, for the purpose of providing improved backset adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art is well documented with examples of tubular lock assemblies with some form of adjustable backset structure. In particular, a desirable feature of such assemblies is the ability to conform to both longer and shorter backsets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first example of a tubular lock with backset adjustability is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,597, issued to Huang, and which teaches a latch bolt cylinder engaged with a casing consisting of two casing parts. An actuating plate is mounted between the casing parts and includes two separate teeth and protrusions. A follower plate, including two separate teeth, is in close contact with the actuating plate and to which the protrusions bear against. A spindle of the tubular lock bears against two teeth of the follower plate, thereby allowing the actuating plate to retract the latch bolt indirectly. Alternatively, the actuating plate can be directly actuated to retract the latch bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example of the prior art is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,257,630, issued to Huang, and which teaches a tubular lock including a latch bolt cylinder that may be extended beyond the doorplate or retracted there into. A casing consists of two casing parts and is engaged to an inner end of the latch bolt cylinder. An actuating plate is mounted between the casing parts and includes two teeth and a number of protrusions. A follower plate is removably held by the protrusions and also has two teeth. A spindle of the tubular lock bears against the teeth of the follower plate or the actuating plate, thereby allowing the actuating plate to retract the latch bolt directly or indirectly. A movable plate is mounted between the casing parts and may be extended beyond the casing parts. The movable plate includes a positioning hole through which one of two mounting posts of the tubular lock extends.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finally, another version of a latch bolt mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,334,635, again issued to Huang, and which differs from Huang '630 in that it teaches the teeth associated with the actuating plate as including a block formed thereon, the blocks being pressed against by a follower plate that also includes two teeth. When either tooth of the actuating plate or follower plate is pressed against by a spindle of the lockset, the latch bolt is retracted. An extension casing is mounted around the plates and movable toward or away from the latch bolt housing. The extension casing includes a first hole and a second hole through which the spindle of the lockset is selectively extended.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention discloses a latch design with adjustable backset and latch bolt features and which provides structural improvements over prior art latch designs. In particular, the present latch design provides an improved configuration associated with the inner and outer casing portions, as well as the intermediately disposed actuating portion, and such as to provide for improved backset adjustment and operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A handle is rotatably mounted to a housing, with a spindle extending from the handle in rotatably slaved fashion and a pair of fixed mounting rods extending from the housing in parallel fashion relative to the spindle. The backset subassembly is arranged in substantially perpendicular extending fashion relative to the spindle and mounting rods, the backset operatively engaging the handle and, in turn, actuating a latch bolt assembly to linearly withdraw in a direction towards the backset upon rotation of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Features of the backset include an inner casing part, an outer spaced apart and aligning casing part, and a linearly actuating plate and a follower plate sandwichingly engaged between the inner and outer casing parts. Each of the inner and outer casing parts having a specified shape and size and each includes a centrally located and aligning opening through which extends the spindle and in combination with at least first and second pairs of individual positioning holes arranged on opposite sides of the central aligning openings and for receiving the mounting rods therethrough. In a preferred arrangement, a third and outermost pair of aligning holes supplements the first side located pair of holes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The actuating plate further includes a lengthwise extending and open interior for facilitating passage therethrough by the spindle and mounting rods. The actuating plate further includes an extending end exhibiting oppositely extending hook portions for engaging the latch bolt assembly. The follower plate seats between the casing parts and against the actuating plate to facilitate extension and retraction of the latch bolt assembly, the follower plate being linearly repositioned between shorter and longer backset positions relative to the casing parts.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The latch bolt assembly further includes a cylinder shaped and interiorly open body within which is mounted a bolt in spring biasing fashion, a stem portion extending from the bolt including gripping tabs for seating the hook portions of the actuating plate and for thereby translating said linear retraction of the actuator plate to the bolt.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exploded view is illustrated generally at <b>10</b> of a latch assembly with adjustable backset according to the present inventions. As will be subsequently described, the present invention discloses a novel and adjustable backset latch and combination latch bolt assembly for incorporating into a handle activated and door locking assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although not shown, the latch assembly is incorporated into a door and door jamb application, and whereby suitable recess configurations are pre drilled or otherwise pre formed between the door and opposing door jamb. It is further understood that all of the components comprising the latch, backset and latch bolt are preferably constructed from a durable and high strength steel or other metal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a handle <b>12</b> is rotatably mounted to a housing, shown as being generally circular in shape at <b>14</b>. As also shown in the rotated perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a spindle <b>16</b> extends from the handle <b>12</b> in rotatably slaved fashion. A pair of fixed mounting rods <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> further extending from the housing <b>14</b> in parallel fashion relative to the spindle <b>16</b>. As is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the spindle <b>16</b> includes a pair of keyed openings <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, these as will be subsequently described engaging portions of the backset latch assembly and for the purpose of actuating the retraction of the lock cylinder bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As clearly referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1A</figref>, a backset subassembly is illustrated in exploded manner and arranged in substantially perpendicular extending fashion relative to the spindle <b>16</b> and mounting rods <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. As will be described subsequently in further detail, the backset is operatively engaged by the handle <b>12</b> and, in turn, actuates a latch bolt assembly (see as generally shown at <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to linearly withdraw in a direction towards the backset, upon rotation of said handle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In relevant part, the backset assembly includes an inner casing part <b>28</b> and an outer spaced apart and aligning casing part <b>30</b>. As will be described in additional detail, a linearly actuating plate <b>32</b> and a follower plate <b>34</b> are sandwichingly engaged between the inner <b>28</b> and outer <b>30</b> casing parts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the inner <b>28</b> and outer <b>30</b> casing parts have a specified shape and size and include a centrally located and aligning opening (see arcuate shaped openings defined by inner boundary edges <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>) and through which extends the spindle <b>16</b>. In combination, first and second pairs of individual positioning and aligning holes (see at <b>40</b> &#x26; <b>42</b> and at <b>44</b> &#x26; <b>46</b>) are arranged on opposite sides of the central aligning openings for parts <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, and for receiving the mounting rods <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> therethrough. A third pair of apertures <b>48</b> &#x26; <b>50</b> are further illustrated in association with the casing parts <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> and are positioned in likewise aligning fashion between the first pair of apertures <b>40</b> &#x26; <b>42</b> and the arcuate central openings <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The actuating plate <b>32</b> further includes a lengthwise extending and open interior <b>52</b> for facilitating passage therethrough by the spindle <b>16</b> and mounting rods <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. The actuating plate <b>32</b> further exhibits an extending end with oppositely arrayed hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> (see also enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and for engaging the latch bolt assembly <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The follower plate <b>34</b> seats between the casing parts <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> and in sliding fashion against the actuating plate <b>32</b> to facilitate extension and retraction of the latch bolt assembly <b>26</b>. The follower plate <b>34</b> is further linearly repositioned between shorter and longer backset positions relative to the casing parts. To facilitate such action, the follower plate <b>34</b> includes a first edge extending and arcuate recess <b>58</b> terminating, at opposite ends, in a pair of teeth <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> (these being dimensioned such as to receive the key apertures defined in circumferential offset along the spindle <b>16</b> as previously described at <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>). A second opposite edge including a likewise central extending and arcuate recess <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a shorter backset position, a selected on of the teeth <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> engages the rotating spindle, simultaneously with contacting protrusions associated with end legs, see at <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> of the actuating plate <b>32</b> extending opposite the hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> thereof, and to indirectly retract the bolt assembly <b>26</b>. In the longer backset position, the follower plate <b>34</b> is moved longitudinally relative to the inner <b>28</b> and outer <b>30</b> casing parts, such that the first arcuate recess <b>58</b> is positioned in alignment with a selected pair of aligning and individual positioning holes (e.g. at <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>) through which a selected mounting rod <b>18</b> extends, and further such that the second arcuate recess <b>64</b> of the follower plate <b>34</b> operates as an axle bearing against the spindle <b>16</b> in order to rotate at a fixed point.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additional features associated with the backset includes the follower plate <b>34</b> exhibiting a pair of bead shaped protrusions, see at <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> in the rotated view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, these extending from an exposed face thereof. A pair of angled edge tabs <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are associated with the outer casing part <b>30</b> and contact the bead shaped protrusions <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> to define a linear end stop position of the follower plate <b>34</b> within the backset subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The actuating plate <b>32</b> further exhibits a specified and generally flattened configuration with the opposite extending hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> each further including a substantially rectangular shape. A pair of inner arcuate edges, see at <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, are associated with each hook portion <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, thereby defining a seating location for receiving appropriate gripping components of the lock bolt assembly <b>26</b> (and as will be shortly described as including a gripping tabs associated with a stem portion of the retractable latch bolt).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additional features of the inner casing part <b>28</b> includes a pair of angularly extending side walls <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, first and second pairs of finger portions <b>86</b> &#x26; <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> &#x26; <b>92</b> extending from first and second (typically end) locations of each of the side walls <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>. Reference is also made to the enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrating the shaping of selected finger gripping portion <b>90</b>. The outer casing part <b>30</b> further includes a substantially plate-shaped (i.e. flattened) configuration with side edge notches (see at <b>94</b> &#x26; <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> &#x26; <b>100</b>), see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, these aligning and assembling with the finger portions <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> associated with the inner casing part <b>28</b> for seatingly engaging to the inner casing part in a desired spaced apart fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inner casing portion <b>28</b> further includes an integral and forward extending blade portion <b>102</b>, this inserting through a slot shaped aperture <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) associated with an end face of the latch bolt <b>26</b> and providing coplanar support with the actuating plate <b>32</b>. A tab <b>106</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) extends from a forward location of the inner casing part <b>28</b> and engages an inside edge surface of the bolt slot aperture <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The outer casing part <b>30</b> further includes a first pair of linearly edge extending gripping portions, at <b>108</b> &#x26; <b>110</b> (again also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and a second pair of angled and opposite edge extending gripping portions <b>112</b> &#x26; <b>114</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for securing the assembled backset in a desired mounting position within a door (not shown). A further pair of linearly edge extending gripping portions are also shown at <b>116</b> &#x26; <b>118</b> for inner casing part <b>28</b> and in order to further assist in securing in place the backset assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additional features of the actuating plate <b>32</b> include its open interior (see as previously shown at <b>52</b>) defining a larger interior aperture (see opposing inner walls <b>120</b>) located approximate the end legs <b>66</b> and <b>68</b>. An interconnecting and narrowed aperture (see further opposing inner walls <b>122</b>) extends forwardly in a direction towards the hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when viewed in combination with the perspective illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1A</figref>, an exploded illustration is shown of the latch bolt assembly <b>26</b> and which includes a cylinder shaped and interiorly open body <b>124</b>, within which is mounted a bolt <b>126</b> in spring biasing fashion. The bolt <b>126</b>, as known, exhibits a rounded arcuate outer profile along one edge which converges with a substantially straight edge to define a seating and opening preventative surface within a suitable door jamb mounted receptacle (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A stem portion <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) extends from the bolt <b>126</b> and includes a flattened forward end <b>130</b> which seats within an apertured interior <b>132</b> associated with the bolt <b>126</b> or can be otherwise integrally formed or mounted therewith. The stem <b>128</b> also includes gripping tabs <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>, these provided for seating and engaging the hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> of the actuating plate <b>32</b>, and for thereby translating the linear retraction of the actuator plate <b>32</b> (as influenced by the action of the spindle <b>16</b> upon the follower plate <b>34</b>) to the bolt <b>126</b>. The end of the stem <b>128</b> opposite the bolt inserting end <b>130</b> is illustrated with a substantially &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped configuration, see at <b>132</b>, it being understood that the shaping of the stem is dictated by dimensional considerations associated with the lock cylinder body interior <b>124</b> and the inserting components of the actuating plate <b>32</b> hook portions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> and the blade portion <b>102</b> of the inner casing part <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a primary spring <b>134</b> is positioned so as to be supported upon a surface of the stem portion body <b>128</b> and which biases at opposite ends with the bolt <b>126</b> and the cylinder body <b>124</b> interior, so as to influence the bolt <b>126</b> in an outward direction relative to the cylinder shaped body <b>126</b>. An anti-theft pin <b>136</b> is supported in both individually retractable and slaved fashion relative to the bolt <b>126</b>, this feature accomplished by the keyed arrangement established between an underside projection <b>138</b> of the pin <b>136</b> and an end-stop <b>140</b> defined upon an upper surface of the bolt <b>126</b> and communicating with guide surfaces for seating thereupon the pin <b>136</b>. Upon mounting the pin <b>136</b> to the bolt <b>126</b>, the pin is permitted to selectively and individually displace in a direction towards the bolt cylinder <b>124</b> (relative to the main bolt <b>126</b>) while being slaved for concurrent inward displacement along with the bolt <b>126</b> and as a result of its end stop <b>140</b> catching the pin underside projection <b>138</b>. thereby preventing the, a secondary spring supported upon opposing shaft portions associated with said anti-theft pin and a further pin mounted to an inside end surface of said open body.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The latch bolt assembly further includes a disk portion, see at <b>142</b>, this being insertable within the open end of the cylinder shaped body <b>124</b>. A pair of circumferentially spaced apart end stops are shown at <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> (see in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as well as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) associated with intermediate inner locations of the open body <b>124</b>, these abutting lower edge locations of the insertable disk portion <b>142</b>. A cross wise slot is defined within and extends along the disk portion <b>142</b>, from an opposite top edge thereof, and defines first locations (see at <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>) for engaging the extending stem gripping portions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>, as well as a second location (at <b>152</b>) for permitting passage therethrough of said anti-theft pin <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A secondary shoulder plate, at <b>154</b>, is supported upon a surface of the bolt retracting stem portion <b>128</b>, and for guidably supporting a secondary spring <b>156</b> which is secured at opposite ends to aligning and seating locations associated with both the anti-theft pin <b>136</b>, at <b>158</b>, as well as with a pin <b>160</b> mounted in extending fashion to an end wall surface of the bolt cylinder <b>124</b>, and through which the slot shaped aperture <b>104</b> is defined. A support plate <b>162</b> is secured in integrally extending fashion relative to the open end of the bolt assembly body <b>124</b>. A face plate <b>164</b> is sandwichingly engaged against the underlying support plate <b>162</b> and further defines an interior aperture <b>166</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for permitting passage therethrough of said bolt and anti-theft pin, as well as additional fastener mounting apertures <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> positioned astride the pin passage aperture <b>166</b>.</p>
