With this structure, an outer end of the press rod <b>381</b> can move the positioning member <b>37</b> at the inner end of the hollow bolt <b>30</b> as are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cam <b>36</b> in the adjusting unit is provided with a first slot <b>361</b> and a second slot <b>362</b>; the positioning member <b>37</b> has a protruding bar <b>371</b> with a bevel portion <b>372</b> on its one end, and is adapted to extending through an opening <b>121</b> on the seat <b>12</b> of the base seat <b>10</b> and an opening <b>351</b> on the strengthening member <b>35</b>, and then extending through the first and second slots <b>361</b>, <b>362</b> of the cam <b>36</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which only shows the cam <b>36</b> and the positioning member <b>37</b> to make clear of the relationship between the two. When the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> is extended through the first slot <b>361</b> as is shown in FIG. <b>5</b>, it will further be extended through an opening <b>221</b> on the seat <b>22</b> of the connecting seat <b>20</b> to unfold the connecting seat <b>20</b> away from the base seat <b>10</b> and to position the connecting seat <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref>, the first slot <b>361</b> of the cam <b>36</b> has a diameter <b>36</b><i>h </i>in a horizontal direction, a first angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> is formed on the upper portion as a depression angle, and a second angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> is formed on the lower portion as an elevation angle for adjusting of the connecting seat <b>20</b> such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>; and as stated in the Description of the Prior Art in the BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION, the depression angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> is about 5 degrees and the elevation angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> is about 10 degrees (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the technique is same as the conventional one).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the base seat <b>10</b> and the connecting seat <b>20</b> are folded to each other to form the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the press rod <b>381</b> can be exerted on its end with a pressure in the direction as shown by an arrow G<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the press rod <b>381</b> thus is retracted to compress the spring <b>382</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, thereby the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> is released from engaging with the opening <b>221</b> on the seat <b>22</b> and the first slot <b>361</b> of the cam <b>36</b>; accordingly, the base seat <b>10</b> can be rotated relatively to the connecting seat <b>20</b> to the folded position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to make the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> aligned exactly with the second slot <b>362</b> of the cam <b>36</b>; now if the pressure exerted by the press rod <b>381</b> is released, by the restoring force of the spring <b>382</b>, the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> is engaged in the second slot <b>362</b> of the cam <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref> again, the second slot <b>362</b> of the cam <b>36</b> contains a stop section <b>362</b><i>a </i>and a slope section <b>362</b><i>b</i>, wherein the stop section <b>362</b><i>a </i>will position the base seat <b>10</b> in the folded state to be unable to move when the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> is extended through the stop section <b>362</b><i>a</i>, this can be benefit to transporting. However, if the connecting seat <b>20</b> and the base seat <b>10</b> are unfolded away from each other, it needs only to pull the connecting seat <b>20</b> to make the bevel portion <b>372</b> on one end of the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b> (please refer to the dot and dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) slide along the slope section <b>362</b><i>b</i>, so that the protruding bar <b>371</b> can be directly extended into the first slot <b>361</b> of the cam <b>36</b> without pressing the press rod <b>381</b>, and the connecting seat <b>20</b> can be adjusted to move to an unfolding position relative to the base seat <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Evidently, in the foldable hinge provided by the present invention, the connecting seat <b>20</b> and the base seat <b>10</b> are very easy to unfold and collapse in operation, adjustment of the depression angle and the elevation angle of the connecting seat <b>20</b> is more convenient than those of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">And more, the present invention can be provided between the cam <b>36</b> and the seat <b>12</b> with a strengthening member <b>35</b> which has an engaging piece <b>352</b> to be engaged in another opening <b>122</b> to complete assembling. By contact of the strengthening member <b>35</b> with the cam <b>36</b>, a function of stopping can be formed to reduce the rate of damage of the seat <b>12</b> having a pivot hole.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">And further to referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in which a second slot <b>362</b>&#x2032; of a cam <b>36</b>&#x2032; only has a stop section <b>362</b><i>a </i>but no slope section <b>362</b><i>b</i>; it needs only to use the bevel portion <b>372</b> on one end of the protruding bar <b>371</b> of the positioning member <b>37</b>, the connecting seat <b>20</b> can be adjusted directly to move to an unfolding position relative to the base seat <b>10</b> without pressing the press rod <b>381</b>. The advantage of such designing is resided in saving the process of manufacturing of the slope section <b>362</b><i>b </i>in the second slot <b>362</b>&#x2032; of the cam <b>36</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Surely, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in which one end of a protruding bar <b>371</b>&#x2032; of a positioning member <b>37</b>&#x2032; does not have the bevel portion <b>372</b>; it needs only to use the slope section <b>362</b><i>b </i>in the second slot <b>362</b> of the cam <b>36</b>, the connecting seat <b>20</b> can be adjusted directly to move to an unfolding position relative to the base seat <b>10</b> without pressing the press rod <b>381</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">What are stated in the specification and shown in the drawings are only for illustrating the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and not for giving any limitation to the scope of the present invention. The scope of protection for this invention is defined by the appended claims of this invention.</p>
