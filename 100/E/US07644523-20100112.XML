<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a vacuum boring and mud recovery method comprising a device which will create a vacuum condition within a vacuum container and the vacuum container is mounted on a sufficient incline to allow debris to be empted out by gravity and to provide space beneath the debris tank to locate a water storage container and having a vacuum conduit to transport a liquid and or solid particles into the vacuum container. A dispensing device may be added to dispense a liquid or a solid from the vacuum container without eliminating the vacuum environment within the vacuum container, and said vacuum container having the ability to fill, store and dispense its contents simultaneously. The vacuum container may further comprises a means to separate a liquid and from solids. Said vacuum conduit articulated boom used to transport debris into the vacuum container may have the added feature or attachments chosen from an earth digging bucket, a telescoping vacuum conduit, sensor to locate buried utilities, monitors and controls to operate the attachments an their function, water spray nozzle, man hole cover remover, cutting tool, grinding tool, saw, blasting tool, surface cleaning tool, demolition tool, torque wrench, tractor to pull vacuum hose, jetter nozzle, or camera and power source to operate them. The above described vacuum system may be mounted on a variety of mobile platforms, chosen from but not limited to a trailer, truck, skid steer, fork lift, track hoe, railroad car, or zero turn radius vehicle which may have the added feature of being convertible between a powered vehicle &#x26; a trailer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current state of the art vacuum boring and mud recovery systems have a vacuum container having the ability to be filled and store liquid and solid particles. After filling said vacuum container to a predetermined capacity, the vacuum producing device must be discontinued, the filling must discontinue, the vacuum environment within the vacuum container is eliminated, the container opened and the contents dumped out. After the container is emptied, the vacuum-producing device may be restarted and the filling and storing may restart. Currently, vacuum containers capable of vacuuming mud and boring earth are operated as a batch process. The vacuum debris container is mounted horizontal and filled with debris. After it is full of debris a hydraulic jack tilts the tank for unloading. The vacuum tank, water tank, and other support equipment are each mounted separately on a trailer or truck bed, thus consuming a lot of floor space.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a means to accomplish a compact, concentrated weight, vacuum boring &#x26; excavation system by creating a vacuum container mounted at a sufficient incline to allow debris to be empted out by gravity and to provide space beneath the debris tank to locate a water storage container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is yet another objective of the invention to provide a means of separating the stored contents by predetermined category and dispensing them without stopping the vacuum fill and store operation or eliminating the vacuum environment within the vacuum container.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide an articulated powered vacuum conduit boom with sufficient structural strength to allow an operator to move and control the location of the suction end of the vacuum conduit and said suction end of said vacuum conduit have an earth digging bucket mounted adjacent it, and said conduit boom with said earth digging bucket being mounted on a mobile vehicle, and a preferred vehicle being a powered zero turn radius vehicle having the ability to be converted into a tow able trailer configuration for the purpose of transporting from job to job.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a vacuum conduit boom with sufficient structural strength, power and articulated movement to allow an operator to move and control the location of the suction end of the vacuum conduit into a manhole lateral line along with a jetter spray nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide an articulated powered vacuum conduit boom with sufficient structural strength to allow an operator to remotely move and control the location of the suction end of the vacuum conduit with one or more attachments adjacently attached to the suction end of said vacuum conduit and said attachments being chosen from an earth digging bucket, a telescoping vacuum conduit, sensor to locate buried utilities, monitors and controls to operate the attachments and their function, water spray nozzle, manhole cover remover, cutting tool, grinding tool, saw, blasting tool, surface cleaning tool, demolition tool, torque wrench, tractor to pull vacuum hose, jetter nozzle, or camera and power source to operate them.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is yet another objective of the present invention to separate hydrocarbons from the contents vacuumed into the vacuum container.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a means to purify or sterilize the contents vacuumed into the vacuum tank.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Using the drawings, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the first embodiment of the invention, being one example of various possible arrangements of apparatus within a vacuum container <b>12</b> for the purpose of accomplishing a method of separating solids <b>6</b> or liquids <b>2</b> by predetermined category and then dispensing said solids <b>6</b> or liquids <b>2</b> using a dispensing means <b>1</b> without eliminating the vacuum environment within the vacuum container <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus of the present invention include a vacuum container <b>12</b>, a vacuum producing means <b>11</b>, a conduit <b>13</b> to allow air to move from vacuum container <b>12</b> to vacuum producing means <b>11</b>, a second conduit <b>14</b> dispenses air from the vacuum producing means <b>11</b>. Vacuum container <b>12</b> has an access door <b>18</b> having a hinge <b>20</b> and a latching means <b>19</b>. Solids <b>6</b> or liquids <b>2</b> are vacuumed into vacuum container <b>12</b> by means of a vacuum conduit <b>17</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ground <b>35</b> is earthen dirt. Liquid <b>2</b>, which has been stored in container <b>8</b>, is pumped by pump <b>7</b> through pump discharge conduit <b>5</b> to a spray nozzle <b>26</b>. The pressurized liquid <b>2</b> dislodges and emulsifies the ground <b>35</b> so it becomes vacuum able. The vacuum able ground <b>35</b> and liquid <b>2</b> are vacuumed through conduit <b>17</b> and into vacuum container <b>12</b>. The solids <b>6</b> and liquids <b>2</b> fall onto a screen <b>21</b> which is vibrated by vibrator <b>23</b>. Screen <b>21</b> is mounted on springs <b>22</b> which are supported by support means <b>24</b>. Liquid <b>2</b> passes through screen <b>21</b> and is dispensed from the vacuum container <b>12</b> by means of a liquid dispenser means <b>1</b> which is shown as a rotary void style in this example. The solids <b>6</b> which are too large to pass through the vibrating screen <b>21</b> are vibrated to a solids dispensing means <b>10</b> which in this example is a rotary void style dispenser. The solids <b>6</b> are dispensed into solids conveyor <b>49</b>. The vacuum container <b>12</b> is supported by a pivot arm <b>28</b> and a cylinder <b>29</b> which may be extended to dump contents out of container access door <b>18</b>. The above system is mounted on a mobile platform <b>31</b> with wheels <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown excavating ground <b>35</b> in order to locate a utility <b>15</b> without doing damage to said utility <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a second embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the screen <b>21</b> is formed in the shape of a cylinder. The solids <b>6</b> and liquids <b>2</b> which are vacuumed through conduit <b>17</b>, are deposited into vacuum container <b>12</b> around the vibrated screen well <b>21</b>. The solids <b>6</b> which cannot pass through the screen well <b>21</b>, remain in the vacuum container <b>12</b> to be dumped out through access door <b>18</b> when it is opened and cylinder <b>29</b> is extended. Liquid <b>2</b> passes through screen <b>21</b> thus dewatering the solids <b>6</b> which remain in vacuum container <b>12</b>. Liquid <b>2</b>, which passes through screen <b>21</b>, is dispensed from vacuum container <b>12</b> by means of liquid dispenser <b>1</b>, which in this example is a pump. The liquid <b>2</b> passes through conduit <b>16</b> and into hydrocyclone <b>25</b> where the solids <b>6</b> and liquid <b>2</b> separation is further refined. The solids <b>6</b> are discharged through solids discharge conduit <b>4</b> into vacuum container <b>12</b> and liquids are discharged through conduit <b>3</b> which discharges into a liquid <b>2</b> storage container <b>8</b> thus providing a method to reclaim and recycle vacuumed liquids <b>2</b>. Purification elements <b>55</b> such as ozone, activated carbon or zealite, hydrocarbon absorbing means <b>56</b> and a sterilization means <b>57</b> is located within the vacuum container <b>12</b>. in order to purify, sterilize or remove hydrocarbons from the liquids <b>2</b> or solids <b>6</b> as they pass through vacuum container <b>12</b>. The sterilization means <b>57</b>, or purification means <b>55</b> or hydrocarbon means <b>56</b> may also be disposed within the suction conduit <b>17</b> or dispensing conduit <b>16</b>, or dispensing means <b>1</b> or <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has the added features of a mobilization means <b>36</b> being a powered mobile boom to articulate the movement of vacuum conduit <b>17</b> and vacuum conduit attachments <b>32</b> which may consist of cutters, demolition means, surface grinders, cleaners, air jets, water jets, scoops, etc. Utility location sensors <b>33</b> with monitor/controller means <b>34</b> are shown to assist in locating and accessing a utility <b>15</b> buried under ground <b>35</b> which may consist of dirt, stone, asphalt, concrete or a combination there of. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown to also be recycling the liquid <b>2</b> as it locates, uncovers or avoids a utility <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a third embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the solids <b>6</b> are passed through a solids grinder <b>27</b> in order to reduce the solids <b>6</b> size to a predetermined size before being dispensed by a solids dispenser <b>10</b> which in this example is a progressive cavity screw. The dispensed solids are collected in solids receiver container <b>9</b> to be hauled off. The liquid <b>2</b> is shown being dispensed by liquid dispenser means <b>1</b>, which in this example is a diaphragm pump. The recycled liquid <b>2</b> is pumped through hose reel <b>37</b> by transfer pump <b>7</b> to a water jetter <b>39</b> spraying a water jet <b>40</b>, thus cleaning drain pipe <b>38</b> with recycled water as it moves.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The recycled liquid <b>2</b> along with solids <b>6</b> washed from drain pipe <b>38</b> are vacuumed up by the vacuum conduit <b>17</b> which is shown as an articulated powered vacuum conduit boom <b>36</b>. The articulated powered boom <b>36</b> also has means to place the jetter <b>39</b> into location down a manhole <b>59</b> and into a lateral drainage conduit <b>38</b> and dispense the jetter conduit <b>58</b>. In this example, telescoping cylinder <b>41</b> is used to articulate the vacuum conduit boom <b>36</b> and jetter <b>39</b>. Vacuum boom structure <b>44</b> allows the vacuum conduit <b>17</b> to be rigid enough to move, support weight and force in order to articulate and operate attachments such as the vacuum conduit tractor <b>51</b> which is articulated into a starting position by the vacuum conduit boom <b>36</b>. Vacuum conduit powered tractor <b>51</b> then moves vacuum conduit <b>17</b> to debris <b>45</b> to be vacuumed. Vacuum hose reel <b>54</b> unreels and retracts vacuum hose <b>17</b> as needed. Vacuum conduit tractor <b>51</b> can have a sensor controller means <b>52</b> attached so as to monitor and control the vacuuming process. Vacuum conduit tractor <b>51</b> can also be fitted with an articulating suction head means <b>53</b>, which allows the vacuum conduit tractor to access debris <b>45</b> in multiple degrees. Although the articulating vacuum conduit boom <b>36</b> is shown vacuuming debris from a drain pipe, said vacuum conduit boom <b>36</b> works equally well vacuuming substances from railcars, barges, tankers, silos, or shavings and dung from the barn and stables.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a fourth embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, &#x26; <b>6</b> the container <b>12</b> is placed on an inclined slope which also creates a location beneath vacuum container <b>12</b> to locate a water storage container <b>8</b>, thus providing a compact vacuum container with water tank <b>8</b> system.
