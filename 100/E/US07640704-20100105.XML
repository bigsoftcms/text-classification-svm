<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/018,159, filed on Dec. 31, 2007, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates generally to doors, such as an entry door and, more specifically, to a door system strengthened by stiffeners.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A common type of door includes a frame to form the periphery of the door, a flat sheet on both the front and back of the door. A gap may exist between the flat sheets, and the gap may remain empty or be filled with an insulator. This type of door, although easy to manufacture, can be both decoratively uninteresting and structurally deficient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Depending upon the area of the country (e.g., hurricane-prone areas) and the type of door (e.g., an entry door), the door may be required to meet certain standards. For example, hurricane testing involves firing one or more projectiles (e.g., a 2&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; piece of wood) at the door and subsequently subjecting the door to simulated wind load cycling. The door is then tested for structural integrity and the ability to continue to keep out rain/wind. A similar type of testing is also performed on a window within the door. Many types of doors (with or without windows) fail to pass this type of testing. There is, therefore, a need for improved door system that provides for greater structural integrity either for the door itself or for a window within the door while at the same time providing a door designer with a greater flexibility for the types of designs/materials used to manufacture the door.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention address deficiencies of the art with respect to providing an improved door having a greater structural integrity. In this regard, a door comprises a frame, first and second outer skins, and first and second stiffeners. The first and second outer skins are respectively connected to first and second sides of the frame, and the first and second stiffeners are positioned between the first and second outer skins and are attached to the frame. The first stiffener is connected to the first side of the frame, and the second stiffener is connected to the second side of the frame. The first and second outer skins are respectively connected to the first and second stiffeners at positions adjacent the frame. The first and second stiffeners are joined together within an area defined by the frame, and the first and second stiffeners are joined together along a plane approximately equidistant from the first and second outer skins. The door also includes a window.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the door system, a gap exists between the first stiffener and the first outer skin and between the second stiffener and the second outer skin where the first stiffener is joined together with the second stiffener. The first outer skin and the first stiffener define a first cavity therebetween, and the second outer skin and the second stiffener define a second cavity therebetween. An insulator is positioned within the first cavity and the second cavity, and the insulator is a rigid foam. The insulator is substantially completely between the first and second outer skins.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In further aspects of the door system, the frame defines a complete outer periphery of the door, and frame includes an outer shell. An insulator is positioned substantially completely within the outer shell. The first and second skins are formed from a different material than the first and second stiffeners. Each of the first and second stiffeners include first and second portions. The first and second portions are respectively within first and second separate planes, and the first and second planes are substantially parallel to and offset from one another. The first and second stiffeners extend substantially along an entire height and width of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> illustrate an exemplar door system <b>100</b> in accordance with the inventive arrangements. The door <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>130</b>, first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B, and first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B. The first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B are respectively connected to first and second sides of the frame <b>130</b>, and the first and second stiffeners <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B are positioned between the first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B. In certain aspects of the door system <b>100</b>, the first and second stiffeners <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B provide additional structural support and impact/penetration resistance to the door system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although shown as an entry door, the door system <b>100</b> is not limited in this manner. For example, the door system <b>100</b> may be also used with pocket doors, sliding doors, French doors, and garage doors. Additionally, the door system <b>100</b> may include one or more windows <b>110</b> and/or decorative features <b>105</b>, such as molding and millwork.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B are not limited as to a particular material. Example materials for use as the outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B include steel, aluminum, wood, plastic, and composites. In certain aspects of the door system <b>100</b>, decorative features <b>105</b> of the door system may be formed within the outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B are also not limited as to a particular material. Example materials for use as the stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B include steel, aluminum, wood, plastic, and composites. However, in certain aspects of the door system <b>100</b>, the stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B are formed from a structural material, such as steel or aluminum so as to provide the additional structural support and impact/penetration resistance to the door system <b>100</b>. By using a structural material for the stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B, in certain aspects of the door system <b>100</b>, the first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B may be formed from a different material, yet less structurally-sound material. This different material, however, may have other desirable characteristics, such as improved environmental resistance, workability, and/or decorativeness.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The frame <b>130</b> is also not limited as to a particular material. Moreover, the frame <b>130</b> may be formed from different materials. For example, a lower portion of the frame <b>130</b> may be formed from a more water- and/or decay-resistant material than other portions of the frame <b>130</b>. Example materials for use as the frame <b>130</b> include steel, aluminum, wood, plastic, and composites.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The frame <b>130</b> may include an outer shell or the frame <b>130</b> can be formed from a solid material. If the frame <b>130</b> is formed using an outer shell, the outer shell of the frame <b>130</b> may be empty or substantially completely filled with an insulator <b>150</b>, such as a rigid foam. In certain aspects, certain linear portions of the outer shell of the frame <b>130</b> are formed from a single piece of material and joined together along a seam <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although not limited in this manner, the frame <b>130</b> may define a complete outer periphery (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the door system <b>100</b>. Additionally, the frame <b>130</b> may include an outer profile <b>137</b> that is adapted to engage with a header, jambs, and a sill (not shown) that surround the door system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain aspects of the door system <b>100</b>, the first stiffener <b>140</b>A is connected to the first side of the frame <b>130</b>, and the second stiffener <b>140</b>B is connected to the second side of the frame <b>130</b>. The first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B may be respectively connected to the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B at positions adjacent the frame <b>130</b>. The first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may extend substantially along an entire height and width of the door system <b>100</b>, and in so doing, the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B are connected to the frame <b>130</b> along the complete periphery, as defined by the frame <b>130</b> of the door system <b>100</b>. Also, with the exception of holes for such features as windows and door knobs, the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may extend throughout the entire interior, as defined by the frame <b>130</b>, of the door system <b>100</b>. In so doing, the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may provide a more complete puncture resistance to the door system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may include first and second portions.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the window <b>110</b> is placed within the portal and the first face of the window <b>110</b> is placed adjacent the supporting surface of the first window support <b>190</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, one or more spacers <b>170</b> may be used to maintain the gap between the first outer skin <b>120</b>A and the first stiffener <b>140</b>A and the gap between the second outer skin <b>120</b>B and the second stiffener <b>140</b>B. Alternatively, or in addition to, the spacers <b>170</b> may be used to connect the bracket <b>160</b> to one or more of the first and second outer skins <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B and/or the first and second stiffeners <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B.
