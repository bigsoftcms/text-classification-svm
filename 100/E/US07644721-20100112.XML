<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mechanism that is comprised of two or more four-bar linkages is shown. Each linkage shares a common link with each adjacent linkage and the movement of said two or more linkages is synchronized by mechanical means such that said mechanism may move between a collapsed and an extended state. Said mechanical means may be in the form of additional links or geared connections.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the area of tents and the provision of temporary shelter. Often there is a need to rapidly set up such shelters. Among standard tent designs, the time required to set them up can be substantial. A series of steps is required including laying the fabric out on the ground, inserting and attaching poles, pulling the structure erect, staking it to the ground, and attaching guy ropes for extra stability. As the size of the tent or shelter increases, the required setup time lengthens.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are various rapidly deployable systems for tents that effectively reduce the setup time. Many of these systems are based on extensible tong linkages, sometimes referred to as scissor linkages. My own U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,031, hereby incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein, utilizes such scissor linkages to construct transformable truss-structures in a variety of shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such scissor linkages are highly effective in creating structures that deploy or transform. However, once the structure is deployed, they are less effective in providing an optimum structural system. The &#x201c;structural depth&#x201d; of a scissor linkage varies widely. In some places, there is significant distance between its links while in other places, both links overlap such that there is no depth provided beyond the individual link dimensions. This results in a basic structural inefficiency. Such inefficiency can limit the structural span, lead to increased weight, and prevent efficient packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">We have discovered a method that solves these problems by creating a system that is equally adapted for optimum deployment as well as structural performance. This system is based on parallel four-bar linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention relates to means of connecting series of four-bar linkages together such that they provide a structural truss in their extended state, provide a compact package in their retracted state, and move together in a synchronized fashion.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A mechanism is herein disclosed that is comprised of two or more four-bar linkages wherein each linkage shares a common link with each adjacent linkage and the movement of said two or more linkages is synchronized by mechanical means such that said mechanism may move between a collapsed and an extended state. Said mechanical means may be in the form of additional links or geared connections.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further disclosed are means to cause the mechanism, when in its extended state, to become stiff and structural. Fabric elements may be attached to these mechanisms to form rapidly deployable shelters.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a linkage system or mechanism that is adapted for optimum deployment and structural performance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a linkage system which provides a structural truss in its extended state.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further object of the invention is to provide a linkage system which provides a compact package in its retracted state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still, other objects of the invention will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, be apparent from the following description.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows two linkages <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> that share a common link <b>5</b>. Linkage <b>1</b> is comprised of four links <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>; linkage <b>10</b> is comprised of four links <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>5</b>. Linkages <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> are shown in a contracted position, such that links <b>3</b> and <b>13</b> form angles <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> relative to the centerline of common link <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the linkages <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> whereby linkage <b>1</b> has been rotated such that the angle <b>8</b> formed by link <b>3</b> relative to common link <b>5</b> is now changed from the similarly formed angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Linkage <b>10</b> is shown to be in the same position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore it may be seen that linkages <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> are capable of moving independently from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows linkage <b>1</b> in a further rotated position, whereas linkage <b>10</b> is in the same position as the previous two figures.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows two linkages <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> that share a common link <b>23</b>. In addition to the four links <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> that comprise linkage <b>15</b>, an additional link <b>31</b> is shown pivotally attached to link <b>25</b> and having a sliding connection to link <b>23</b>. In addition to the four links <b>23</b>,<b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> that comprise linkage <b>16</b>, an additional link <b>32</b> is shown pivotally attached to link <b>29</b> and having a sliding connection to link <b>23</b>. Linkages <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are shown in a contracted position, such that links <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> form angles <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> relative to the centerline of common link <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows linkages <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> moved to different positions such that links <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> form angles <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> respectively relative to the centerline of link <b>23</b>. In this case, links <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> ensure that the movement of linkage <b>15</b> is not independent of the movement of linkage <b>16</b>; that is, both linkages move in a synchronized manner.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows linkages <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> moved to a third position such that that links <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> form angles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> respectively relative to the centerline of link <b>23</b>. Again, the movement of linkage <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> is synchronized by additional links <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a mechanism <b>38</b> which is comprised of two linkages <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> sharing a common link <b>45</b>.

Link <b>41</b> may be seen to be essentially parallel with link <b>47</b>. Link <b>42</b> terminates at one end with a gear <b>44</b>; link <b>46</b> terminates with gear <b>49</b>. Gears <b>44</b> and <b>49</b> are engaged with each other. Gears <b>44</b> and <b>49</b> have equal pitch diameters, that is, are effectively the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows mechanism <b>38</b> whereby linkages <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> have been rotated to a different position.

The movement of linkages <b>41</b> and <b>47</b> is synchronized by the engagement of gears <b>44</b> and <b>49</b>. It may be seen that angles <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are essentially equal: this equality is a result of the equal diameters of gears <b>44</b> and <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows mechanism <b>38</b> in a third position whereby links <b>41</b> and <b>47</b> form angles <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> with the center line of common link <b>45</b>.
