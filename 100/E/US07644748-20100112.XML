<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a control mechanism for controlling the slats of cordless blinds up and down.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional blind generally includes a head which is fixed to the wall and a control mechanism is received in the head. A top rail is connected to the head and a plurality of slats are connected between the top rail and the bottom rail. Some of the conventional blinds are equipped with a lift cord which hangs on the head and the user can pulls the lift cord to move the slats upward or downward. However, the hanging lift cord has a potential risk for the children. Some of the conventional blinds do not need the lift cord and includes a control mechanism and a transmission unit which is connected with a plurality of cords and a transmission cable. The control mechanism provides torque to control the operation of the cords and transmission cable to move the slats up and down. The conventional cordless blind cannot tilt the slats.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention intends to provide a control mechanism for cordless blinds and the control mechanism controls the slats upward and downward movement and also controls the tilt angle of the slats.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a cordless blind which comprises a top rail and a transmission unit, a scrolling unit and a tilt unit are respectively received in the space defined in the head. The transmission unit includes a transmission cable extending therefrom which is connected with a scrolling rod. The scrolling unit includes two scrolling cables which have respective one of two ends thereof wrapped to two ends of the rod, and the other end of each scrolling cables extends through the top rail and the parallel slats and is connected to a bottom rail. A tilt unit includes a tilt member and respective one of two ends of two tilt cables is connected to two ends of the tilt member, the other end of each tilt cable extends through the top rail and is connected to the parallel slats. The tilt unit further includes a tilt wand which is able to rotate the tilt member to move the tilt cables moved upward and downward so as to tilt the slats.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the cordless blind of the present invention comprises a top rail <b>20</b> which has a space <b>21</b> defined therein, a control mechanism <b>10</b> received in the space, a plurality of slats <b>11</b>, and a bottom rail <b>12</b>. The slats <b>11</b> are located between the top and bottom rails <b>20</b>, <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The control mechanism <b>10</b> includes a transmission unit <b>30</b>, a scrolling unit <b>40</b> and a tilt unit <b>50</b>. The transmission unit <b>30</b> is received in the space <b>21</b> and has a transmission cable <b>31</b> extending therefrom. One end of the transmission cable <b>31</b> is wrapped to an end of a scrolling rod <b>41</b> to form a first wrapping portion <b>31</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The scrolling unit <b>40</b> is received in the space <b>21</b> and has two scrolling cables <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> which have respective one of two ends thereof wrapped to two ends of the rod <b>41</b> to form the second and third wrapping portions <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>43</b><i>a</i>. The other end of each scrolling cables <b>42</b>/<b>43</b> extends through the top rail <b>20</b> and the parallel slats <b>11</b> and is connected to a bottom rail <b>12</b>. The scrolling unit <b>40</b> includes two supports <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> fixedly connected to eh top rail <b>20</b> by screws <b>49</b> so as to support the scrolling rod <b>41</b>. Two pulleys <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> are connected to the two supports <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and the scrolling cables <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> reeve through the two pulleys <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> and then are wrapped to the scrolling rod <b>41</b> to form the second and third wrapping portions <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The tilt unit <b>50</b> is received in the space <b>21</b> and has a tilt member <b>51</b>, wherein respective one of two ends of two tilt cables <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> are connected to two ends of the tilt member <b>51</b>, and the other end of each tilt cable <b>52</b>/<b>53</b> extend through the top rail <b>20</b> and are connected to the parallel slats <b>11</b>. The tilt unit <b>50</b> further includes the two positioning members <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> received in the space <b>20</b> and two spinning members <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> are engaged with the positioning members <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> respectively. Each of the two positioning members <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> has a holes <b>22</b>/<b>23</b> through which the scrolling cable <b>42</b>/<b>43</b> and the tilt cable <b>52</b>/<b>53</b> extend. The rollers <b>551</b>, <b>561</b> are located in the holes <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> so that the scrolling cables <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> pass around the rollers <b>551</b>, <b>561</b> at substantially right angle. Each of the two spinning members <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> has an engaging port <b>571</b>/<b>581</b> so that the tilt cables <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> are engaged with the engaging ports <b>571</b>, <b>581</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support <b>45</b> that is located close to the transmission unit <b>30</b> includes a tubular member <b>48</b> and the transmission cable <b>31</b> goes around the tubular member <b>48</b> and is wrapped to the scrolling rod <b>41</b> at a substantially right angle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, each of the two supports <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> is an inverted T-shaped member and a notch <b>441</b>/<b>451</b> is defined in a top of each of the two supports <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> such that the scrolling rod <b>41</b> is engaged with the two respective notches <b>441</b>, <b>451</b>. A base <b>442</b>/<b>452</b> is connected to a bottom of each of the two support <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> so as to receive the pulley <b>46</b>/<b>47</b> corresponding thereto. The two scrolling cables <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are guided by rollers <b>551</b>, <b>561</b> of two positioning members <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> of the tilt unit <b>50</b> and are reeved through the pulleys <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second and third wrapping portions <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>a </i>form a torque balance with the first wrapping portion <b>3</b> la so as to keep the slats <b>11</b> at their position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. When the user holds the bottom rail <b>12</b> and pulls it downward, the balance of the toque between the second and third wrapping portions <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>a </i>and the first wrapping portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>is changed, so that the slats <b>11</b> is pulled downward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. When the use releases the bottom rail <b>12</b>, the balance of the toque between the second and third wrapping portions <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>a </i>and the first wrapping portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>is obtained again. Therefore, the slats <b>11</b> can be set at a desired height.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, each of the two spinning members <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> has a slot <b>572</b>/<b>582</b> with which the tilt member <b>51</b> is engaged such that the two spinning members <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> are co-rotated, and the tilt member <b>51</b> extends through the scrolling rod <b>41</b>. A tilt wand <b>54</b> is used to rotate the tilt member <b>51</b> to move the tilt cables <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> moved upward and downward so as to tilt the slats <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
