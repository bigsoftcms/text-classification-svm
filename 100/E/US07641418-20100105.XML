<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to road reconstruction equipment and, more particularly, to a method for depositing pavement rejuvenation materials on a roadway. Since their debut in the late 1960s and early 1970s, asphalt milling machines have been considered one of the major innovations in road reconstruction. Asphalt milling machines were originally designed to remove a top layer of deteriorated asphalt so a new layer of asphalt could be overlaid on the exposed underlayer. The resulting pavement was superior to simply overlaying a new layer of asphalt directly onto the old and deteriorated asphalt.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One significant benefit of asphalt milling machines that has emerged modernly is the ability to break up asphalt into recyclable-sized fragments. As recycling of all types has become more popular, asphalt milling machines have similarly increased in popularity. In fact, combination milling and paving machines have been developed to mill or break up the old road surface, mix it with new binder, and lay it down to create a new or recycled road surface in one continuous process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The core component of most modern asphalt milling machines is the cutting drum. Most cutting drums incorporate numerous cutting teeth, coupled to the rounded surface of the drum, to cut or tear into the road surface. The rotational axis of the drum is positioned parallel to the road surface and the drum is rotated while being driven along the road surface in a direction transverse to its axis of rotation. Conventional cutting drums mill the asphalt in an upward direction, or an &#x201c;up-cut&#x201d; direction. However, some cutting drums may permit &#x201c;down-cutting&#x201d; to control &#x201c;slabbing,&#x201d; facilitate pulverizing and mixing, and effectively mill pavement over a wet base. Most cutting drums range in width from 12 to 150 inches and generally have a maximum cutting depth of 4 to 16 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the abrasive nature of pavement, the cutting teeth traditionally wear out quickly and require frequent replacement. The replacement process may create significant downtime and hinder the overall efficiency of the milling process. For example, early cutting drums had cutting teeth that were welded to the drum. Tooth replacement required cutting the old teeth from the drum and welding new teeth in their place. Consequently, considerable effort has been expended to accelerate the replacement process and to increase the durability of the cutting teeth. Many newer cutting teeth, for example, are coupled to the cutting drum using various bolt-on housings to enable faster replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One shortcoming of current asphalt milling machines is their failure to capitalize on cutting-edge technology used in other industries, such as the downhole drilling industry. For example, numerous technological improvements in polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, which were introduced to the oil and gas industry in the mid 1970s, have enabled PCD bits to capture a growing share of the downhole drill bit market. Some estimates show that between 2000 and 2003, the total footage drilled with PDC bits increased from 26% in 2000 to 50% in 2003. The total revenue generated by PDC bit sales was approximately $600 million in 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various recent improvements in PDC bit hydraulics, PDC cutter toughness and abrasion-resistance, and PDC bit dynamic stability have resulted in continuous and significant increases in the average rate of penetration (ROP) and bit life of PDC bits, thereby extending the application of PDC bits into harder and more abrasive formations. In some cases, a single PDC bit may drill 20,000 feet or more without replacement. As a result, a PCD bit may save as much as $1 million per well in time-critical drilling applications. It would be a significant advance if drill bit improvements in the downhole drilling industry could be applied to the road reconstruction industry, where downtime and replacement costs incur significant expense.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, what are needed are apparatus and methods for incorporating drill bit and other advances of the downhole drilling industry into road reconstruction equipment. More particularly, apparatus and methods are needed to incorporate PCD and other drill bit advances into asphalt milling, grinding, and recycling equipment. Further needed are novel supplemental and auxiliary systems, such as apparatus for depositing new or recycled pavement rejuvenation materials on a roadway, to work in conjunction such apparatus and methods, to facilitate the removal and recycling of asphalt and other pavement materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the invention a method includes the steps of forming a layer of pavement aggregate by degrading pavement with a plurality of degradation elements attached to an underside of a vehicle and adapted to independent movement of each other; providing a channel attached to a vehicle adapted to traverse an area comprising a layer of pavement aggregate, the channel being in communication with at least one supply of pavement rejuvenation material; positioning the channel so that at least a portion of the channel is disposed within the layer; and adding the pavement rejuvenation material into the layer from an opening in the channel positioned below the surface of the layer. In certain embodiments, the channel may comprise a trough, trench, tubing, hose, chamber, pipe, pressurized pathway, a funnel, chute, conduit, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method may further include the step of mixing at least some pavement rejuvenation material from the at least one supply with at least some pavement rejuvenation material from a second supply of pavement rejuvenation material to form a resultant rejuvenation material, which may foam under atmospheric pressure. The mixing of the pavement rejuvenation materials may occur under a pressure high enough to keep the resultant rejuvenation material from foaming. In embodiments where the mixing takes place within the channel under a high pressure, the resultant material may foam as it exits the opening in the channel. It is believed foaming the rejuvenation materials will be beneficial in recycling paved surfaces since the foaming action may spread the rejuvenation material through the layer. Timing may be important since the rate of foaming may decrease rapidly. By keeping the step of mixing the pavement rejuvenation materials under high pressure, foaming may be delayed until the instant that it is desired, thus allowing the foamed resultant material to spread into as much aggregate as possible. In some embodiments, zeolite may be incorporated in the rejuvenation material, which may help control the rate of foaming. In some embodiments a foaming half-life is between 5-60 seconds. A more preferred foaming half-life is 20 seconds or more.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the second supply of pavement rejuvenation material is water, which mixes with an oil-based rejuvenation material, such as bitumen. In some embodiments, the second supply is air, another gas, another liquid, or combinations thereof. The temperature of both supplies of rejuvenation material may vary, but preferably both supplies are hot. In some embodiments, it may be desirable for the second supply of rejuvenation materials to be cool. Heat sources may be placed within or adjacent the channel to heat either supply of rejuvenation material. In other embodiments the rejuvenation material(s) may be heated prior to entering the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to have a sprayer attached to the vehicle which is adapted to spray rejuvenation material into the surface of the layer. This may increase the surface energy of aggregate coated with the rejuvenation material. In some embodiments the sprayed rejuvenation material under goes a foaming process similar to the rejuvenation material traveling through the channel, although the sprayed material may or may not be foamed. The channels may be adapted to vibrate, rotate, shake, move, or oscillate which may help spread rejuvenation material throughout the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments the opening of the channel is protected by a superhard material. This may be beneficial in embodiments where the channel contacts a second layer underneath the layer of aggregate. Preferably, the rejuvenation material is deposited on the second layer and foams up into the layer of pavement aggregate. Since the rejuvenation material is deposited on the second layer it will bond the two layers together.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Thus, use of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this specification may, but does not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following description, numerous specific details are disclosed to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this application, &#x201c;pavement&#x201d; or &#x201c;paved surface&#x201d; refers to any artificial, wear-resistant surface that facilitates vehicular, pedestrian, or other form of traffic. Pavement may include composites containing oil, tar, tarmac, macadam, tarmacadam, asphalt, asphaltum, pitch, bitumen, minerals, rocks, pebbles, gravel, polymeric materials, sand, polyester fibers, Portland cement, petrochemical binders, or the like. Likewise, rejuvenation materials refer to any of various binders, oils, and resins, including bitumen, surfactant, polymeric materials, emulsions, asphalt, tar, cement, oil, pitch, maltenes, zeolite, wax, or the like. Reference to aggregates refers to rock, crushed rock, gravel, sand, slag, soil, cinders, minerals, or other course materials, and may include both new aggregates and aggregates reclaimed from an existing roadway. Likewise, the term &#x201c;degrade&#x201d; or &#x201c;degradation&#x201d; is used in this application to mean milling, grinding, cutting, ripping apart, tearing apart, or otherwise taking or pulling apart a pavement material into smaller constituent pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in selected embodiments, a pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may be adapted to degrade and recycle a section of pavement substantially wider than the machine's width <b>102</b>. The pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may include a shroud <b>104</b>, covering various internal components of the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b>, a frame <b>105</b>, and a translation mechanism <b>106</b> such as tracks, wheels, or the like, to translate or move the machine <b>100</b>, such translation mechanisms being well known to those skilled in the art. The pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may also include means <b>107</b> for adjusting the elevation and slope of the frame <b>105</b> relative to the translation mechanism <b>106</b> to adjust for varying elevations, slopes, and contours of the underlying road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In selected embodiments, to facilitate degradation of a swath of pavement wider than the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b>, the recycling machine <b>100</b> may include two or more support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>that are capable of extending beyond the outer edge of the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b>. Because the support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may be as wide as the vehicle itself, the extended support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may sweep over a width approximately twice the vehicle width <b>102</b>. These assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may include banks <b>109</b> of pavement degradation tools <b>110</b> that rotate about an axis substantially normal to a plane defined by a paved surface. Each of these pavement degradation tools <b>110</b> may be used to degrade a paved surface in a direction substantially normal to their axes of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To extend the support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>beyond the outer edge of the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b>, each of the support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may include actuators <b>112</b>, such as hydraulic cylinders, pneumatic cylinders, or other mechanical devices known to those of skill in the art, to move the assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>to each side of the machine <b>100</b>. Each support assembly <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may also include a rake <b>114</b> to level, smooth, and mix pavement aggregates, including new aggregates and reclaimed aggregates generated by the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>. As illustrated, a rake <b>114</b> may include a housing <b>116</b> comprising multiple injectors <b>118</b> extending therefrom. In selected embodiments, each of the injectors <b>118</b> may be independently extended and retracted relative to the housing <b>116</b>. This feature may allow selected injectors to be retracted to avoid obstacles such as manholes, grates, or other obstacles in the roadway.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In certain embodiments, each of the injectors <b>118</b> may be hollow to accommodate a flow of pavement rejuvenation materials for deposit on a road surface. Pavement rejuvenation materials may include, for example, asphalt, bitumen, tar, oil, water, combinations thereof, or other suitable materials, resins, and binding agents. These rejuvenation materials may be mixed with various aggregates, including new aggregates and reclaimed aggregates generated by the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>. The resulting mixture may then be smoothed and compacted to form a recycled road surface. In selected embodiments, the rake <b>114</b> may move side-to-side, front-to-back, in a circular pattern, vibrate, or the like to aid in mixing the resulting mixture of aggregates and rejuvenation materials. In certain embodiments, each support assembly <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>may include a bank <b>120</b> of one or more tampers <b>122</b> to compact the recycled road surface. Like the injectors <b>118</b>, the tampers <b>122</b> may, in certain embodiments, be independently extendable and retractable relative to the bank <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Under the shroud <b>104</b>, the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may include an engine and hydraulic pumps for powering the translation mechanism <b>106</b>, the support assemblies <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>, or other components. Likewise, the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may include a tank <b>124</b> for storing hydraulic fluid, a fuel tank <b>126</b>, a tank <b>128</b> for storing a first supply of rejuvenation materials such as asphalt, bitumen, oil, tar, or the like, another tank <b>130</b> for storing a second supply of rejuvenation material, such as a water tank, and a hopper <b>132</b> for storing aggregate such as gravel, rock, sand, pebbles, macadam, concrete, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as previously mentioned, a rake <b>114</b> may comprise a housing <b>116</b> and multiple injectors <b>118</b> extending therefrom. A duct <b>138</b> may travel through the housing <b>116</b> to provide a supply of rejuvenation materials under pressure to each of the injectors <b>118</b>. In certain embodiments, the duct <b>138</b> may travel through a separate housing <b>140</b> which may be bolted or otherwise connected to the main housing <b>116</b> using connectors <b>142</b>, such as bolts <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, an injector <b>118</b> may comprise a first channel <b>134</b> in communication with the supply of pavement rejuvenation materials provided by the duct <b>138</b>. The outside diameter of the first channel may slide inside a second channel <b>136</b> thereby transmitting the supply of pavement rejuvenation materials into the second channel <b>136</b>. In certain embodiments, the first channel <b>134</b> may remain relatively fixed with respect to the housing <b>116</b>, while the second channel <b>136</b> may extend and retract (downward in the illustrated embodiment) with respect to the first channel <b>134</b> and the housing <b>116</b>. A seal may be provided between the first channel <b>134</b> and the second channel <b>136</b> to prevent leakage of rejuvenation materials where the two channels <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> interface.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A blocking element <b>144</b> may be coupled to the second channel <b>136</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the blocking element <b>144</b> has a conical shape although other shapes are possible and within the scope of the invention. As will become apparent in the description associated with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the second channel <b>136</b> slides upward with respect to the first channel <b>134</b>, the blocking element <b>144</b> contacts a seat <b>146</b> coupled to the first channel <b>134</b>. The blocking element <b>144</b> and the seat <b>146</b> together form a valve <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. Upon contacting the seat <b>146</b>, the blocking element <b>144</b> seals off the first channel <b>134</b>, thereby cutting off the flow of rejuvenation materials. Thus, when the injector <b>118</b> is retracted (i.e., slid upward), the flow of pavement rejuvenation materials is cut off. Conversely, when the injector <b>118</b> is extended, the valve <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> opens and re-initiates the flow of rejuvenation materials. As shown, the blocking element <b>144</b> may include one or more passageways <b>148</b> to accommodate a flow of pavement rejuvenation materials when the valve <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> is open. These passageways <b>148</b> may connect to an opening <b>150</b> for depositing the pavement rejuvenation materials on a road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The hardened tip <b>152</b> may be coupled to the second channel <b>136</b> to provide added durability to the injector <b>118</b> and to resist the abrasive effects of pavement materials (i.e., rock, gravel, concrete, etc.) on the road surface. For example, in certain embodiments, the hardened tip <b>152</b> may be coated with diamond, boron nitride, a cemented metal carbide, or combinations mixtures, or alloys thereof, to provide added durability. A hardened tip may also reduce wear and/or corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments of the present invention, a nozzle may be fitted within the opening <b>150</b> for depositing the pavement rejuvenation materials on a road surface. The nozzle may increase the pressure exerted on the pavement rejuvenation materials as they exit the opening <b>150</b>. A nozzle <b>2000</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may also increase the temperature and pressure of the pavement rejuvenation material immediately before the rejuvenation material exits the opening <b>150</b>, which may allow rejuvenation material to be heated to a higher temperature before they are deposited. The nozzle may also comprise a particular pattern which may help deposit the rejuvenation material in a specific desired manner. Individual injectors <b>118</b> may comprise a nozzle with a different pattern such that the injectors near the end of the swath of pavement may deposit the rejuvenation material differently than the injectors that are positioned near the middle of the same swath of pavement.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To extend and retract the injector <b>118</b>, a piston <b>154</b> may be coupled to the second channel <b>136</b> and slide with respect to the first channel <b>134</b>. The first channel <b>134</b> may slide through a bore in the piston <b>154</b>. The housing <b>116</b> may comprise a chamber <b>156</b> to accommodate the travel of the piston <b>154</b>. In certain embodiments, the piston <b>154</b> may be driven by hydraulic fluid supplied under pressure to the chamber <b>156</b>, although it is contemplated that pressurized air or other fluids could also be used. In one embodiment, hydraulic fluid may be supplied to the chamber <b>156</b> through a pair of passageways <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> in the housing <b>116</b>. Hydraulic fluid supplied under pressure through a first passageway <b>158</b> may exert force on a first surface <b>162</b> of the piston <b>154</b>, while hydraulic fluid supplied under pressure through a second passageway <b>160</b> may exert force on a second surface <b>164</b> of the piston <b>154</b>. Because the second channel <b>136</b> may connect to one end of the piston <b>154</b>, the area of the first surface <b>162</b> may be larger than the area of the second surface <b>164</b>. Thus, applying equal hydraulic pressure to each of the first and second surfaces <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, the piston <b>154</b> will be urged downward due to the greater area of the surface <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to extend and retract the injector <b>118</b>, in selected embodiments, hydraulic pressure may be supplied continuously over time through the passageway <b>160</b>. Conversely, a roughly equal hydraulic pressure may be selectively turned on or off through the passageway <b>158</b> by way of a valve <b>166</b>. Thus, when hydraulic pressure through the passageway <b>158</b> is turned off, continuous pressure supplied through the passageway <b>160</b> urges the piston <b>154</b> upward. As the piston <b>154</b> travels upward, hydraulic fluid above the piston <b>154</b> and inside the passageway <b>158</b> may flow into a hydraulic fluid reservoir or tank (not shown). On the other hand, when hydraulic pressure through the passageway <b>158</b> is turned on, this hydraulic pressure overcomes the hydraulic pressure supplied through the passageway <b>160</b> (due to the difference in the piston surface areas <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>), thereby urging the piston <b>154</b> downward and extending the injector <b>118</b> relative to the housing <b>116</b>. Although the present invention is not limited by any set pressure or range of pressures, in selected embodiments, the piston <b>154</b> may be actuated by fifty to one hundred and fifty PSI of hydraulic pressure. In selected embodiments, the valve <b>166</b> may be solenoid driven, be screwed into the housing <b>116</b>, and be actuated by way of an electrical connection <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At or near the bottom surface <b>169</b> of the housing <b>116</b>, one or more bushings may be used to act as a bearing between the second channel <b>136</b> and the housing <b>116</b>, and one or more seals may be used to contain the hydraulic pressure within the chamber <b>156</b> and to prevent contamination from entering the chamber <b>156</b>. The bushings and/or seals may be retained and accessed by way of a plate <b>180</b> coupled to the housing <b>116</b> by way of one or more connectors <b>182</b>, such as bolts <b>182</b>. Similarly, a retainer <b>184</b> may be positioned at or near the top of the chamber <b>156</b> and may be used to retain the first channel <b>134</b> in a substantially fixed position with respect to the housing <b>116</b>. In selected embodiments, the retainer <b>184</b> may be screwed into the housing <b>116</b> and may include a clip to engage a slot milled in the first channel <b>134</b>. The retainer <b>184</b> may also include a stopper <b>186</b> to stop the upward travel of the piston <b>154</b>. In certain embodiments, the retainer <b>184</b> may be accessed by removing the duct housing <b>140</b> from the main housing <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, upon turning off the hydraulic pressure in the passageway <b>158</b>, hydraulic pressure through the passageway <b>160</b> urges the piston <b>154</b> and the second channel <b>136</b> upward, thereby retracting the injector <b>118</b> relative to the housing <b>116</b>. As the injector <b>118</b> moves upward, the blocking element <b>144</b> (in this embodiment a conically shaped blocking element) contacts the seat <b>146</b>, thereby blocking the first channel <b>134</b>. This cuts off the flow of pavement rejuvenation materials flowing through the first and second channels <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as previously mentioned, a valve <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> opens upon extending an injector <b>118</b> relative to the housing <b>116</b>. This allows rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> to flow through the first and second channels <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> onto a road surface <b>172</b>. As previously explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> may be supplied under pressure by way of a duct <b>138</b> communicating with the first and second channels <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>. Once expelled from the injector <b>118</b>, the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> may be mixed with aggregates <b>174</b>, which may include reclaimed pavement aggregates generated by the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b> (referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), new aggregates, or combinations thereof. The resulting mixture <b>176</b> may then be smoothed and compacted to form a new or recycled pavement surface. In certain embodiments, a bottom surface <b>178</b> of the housing <b>116</b> may be used as a screed to smooth and/or compact the resulting pavement mixture <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In selected embodiments, the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> may be discharged from the injector <b>118</b> in a &#x201c;foamed&#x201d; state. For example, in certain embodiments, a mixture of water and hot bitumen may be discharged from the injector <b>118</b>. The pressure drop that occurs upon discharge may cause the mixture of hot bitumen and water to spontaneously transform into foam. This &#x201c;foamed bitumen&#x201d; has a significantly reduced viscosity compared to unfoamed bitumen, which allows the bitumen to be more easily mixed with aggregates <b>174</b>. The foamed bitumen may also expand to saturate and permeate the aggregates <b>174</b>. The resulting mixture, or &#x201c;foamed asphalt,&#x201d; may provide several significant advantages when performing in place, or in situ, pavement recycling. For example, it is reported that foamed bitumen increases the shear strength of the resulting paved surface, while reducing its susceptibility to moisture. The strength of foamed asphalt may approach that of cemented materials, while being more flexible and fatigue resistant than cemented materials.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, when performing cold or warm mix processes, this foaming technique may allow bitumen (or other rejuvenation materials) to be mixed with a wider variety of aggregates. Foamed asphalt may also require less binder and water than other methods of cold mixing, which reduces binder and transportation costs. Foamed asphalt can also be compacted and used immediately upon deposit to the road surface, thereby saving time and money. Furthermore, this technique conserves energy because only the bitumen requires heating; the aggregates may be mixed while cold or damp. In the preferred embodiment, the asphalt is heated prior to adding the pavement rejuvenation material within 100 to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Energy may still be conserved in such embodiments when compared with typical hot-in-place recycling methods.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Other advantages include reported environmental benefits. The foaming technique reduces environmental harm that may occur from the evaporation of volatiles from the asphalt mix because curing generally does not release volatiles into the environment. According to some reports, foamed asphalt may also be stockpiled without binder runoff or leeching. Foamed asphalt may be deposited in adverse weather conditions, such as cold temperatures or light rain, without changing the characteristics or quality of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as previously mentioned, a pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> may progressively degrade an asphalt surface <b>204</b> into a layer of pavement aggregate <b>174</b>, add pavement rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> to the layer of pavement aggregate <b>174</b>, level the surface of the pavement rejuvenation material and aggregate mixture <b>208</b> and compact the mixture <b>208</b> into finished asphalt <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the pavement recycling machine <b>100</b> moves forward in the direction indicated by the arrow, new aggregate <b>174</b> may be deposited on the asphalt surface <b>204</b>. The new aggregate <b>174</b> may be added to compensate for any crushing or deterioration of old aggregate <b>174</b> during the degradation of the asphalt surface <b>204</b> in addition to changes in the old aggregate <b>174</b> that may have occurred over the life of the asphalt surface <b>204</b>. A rejuvenating fog <b>209</b> may be deposited on the new aggregate <b>174</b> from a fogging nozzle <b>203</b> prior to and/or during degradation of the asphalt surface <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, rejuvenating fog <b>209</b> may be deposited on both new and old aggregate <b>174</b> after the asphalt surface <b>204</b> is degraded. The rejuvenating fog <b>209</b> may comprise a mixture of maltenes and serve a number of purposes. For example, the rejuvenating fog <b>209</b> may wet the aggregate <b>174</b> to allow better adhesion to additional rejuvenation material <b>207</b> that may be added later, act as a dust suppressant, and restore maltene content in the original aggregate <b>174</b> that may have been lost due to wear and tear on the road.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The original asphalt surface <b>204</b> may be abraded by pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>. The pavement degradation tools may comprise diamond. After passing through the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b> the original asphalt surface <b>204</b> may become a layer comprising a mixture of recovered and new aggregate <b>174</b>. A rejuvenating fog <b>209</b> may also be applied to the newly recovered aggregate <b>174</b> after passing through the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The injector <b>118</b> of rake <b>114</b> may comprise at least one channel <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and an opening <b>150</b>. One feature of the present invention is that pavement rejuvenating materials <b>170</b> are added to the layer of aggregate <b>174</b> below the surface of the layer. The injector <b>118</b> may comprise a special diamond tip that allows it to drag against the bottom of the layer of aggregate <b>174</b> while injecting rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> into the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> foam under atmospheric pressure. This would allow the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> to foam on injection into the layer of pavement aggregate <b>174</b> and coat both the new and recovered aggregate <b>174</b> as foamed material <b>170</b> rises to the surface of the layer. Preferably the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> may comprise a binder such as bitumen mixed with a foaming agent, such as water. In some embodiments the rejuvenation materials may comprise a synthetic zeolite such as Aspha-Min&#xae; that can store water and thermally release it into the binder when heated. In other embodiments a wax such as Sasobit&#xae; may be incorporated into the rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> to lower the viscosity of the rejuvenation material and aggregate mixture. At lower temperatures below its melting point the wax may freeze and afford additional mechanical strength to the aggregate and pavement rejuvenation material mixture <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A screed <b>201</b> may be used to level the mixture <b>208</b> and prepare it for compaction by a tamper <b>122</b> or other discrete elements such as vibratory rollers, and/or vibratory sleds. Once compacted, the new pavement <b>202</b> may be finished and sealed to provide protection against the elements, and tests on the pavement <b>202</b> may be performed to collect feedback on the recycling process.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pavement degradation tools <b>110</b>, may be spin in opposite directions helping incorporate new aggregate with aggregate recovered from the degradation of the original pavement surface <b>204</b>. The pavement degradation tools <b>110</b> may move side to side as the pavement recycling machine moves forward into the original pavement surface <b>204</b>. Each tool <b>110</b> may also be able to individually move up and down to avoid obstacles such as manholes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as previously mentioned, injectors <b>118</b> from the rake <b>114</b> may extend to varying depths in the layer of aggregate <b>174</b>. At different depths, the pavement rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> may flow out and coat the aggregate <b>174</b> more thoroughly. The injectors <b>118</b> may be raised and lowered as specific layers of aggregate <b>174</b> may require. A nozzle <b>206</b> may fog or spray fresh rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> onto the surface of the layer of aggregate <b>174</b> to ensure adequate surface coating. In some embodiments the injectors <b>118</b> may comprise sensors that detect the amount of rejuvenation materials <b>170</b> being dispersed into the aggregate <b>174</b> and appropriate settings on the height and flow of the injectors <b>118</b> and nozzle <b>206</b> may be adjusted accordingly to obtain maximum efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as previously mentioned, the rejuvenating material <b>170</b> may be mixed with a second rejuvenating material <b>170</b> from another source to produce a foamed asphalt or another resultant rejuvenating substance. The first rejuvenating material <b>170</b> may flow through a mixing chamber <b>207</b> in the direction indicated by arrow <b>900</b> as the second rejuvenating material <b>170</b> flows through a conduit <b>208</b> into the mixing chamber <b>207</b> as indicated by arrow <b>901</b>. The conduit <b>208</b> may be perpendicular to the mixing chamber in order to provide optimal mixing of the rejuvenating materials <b>170</b>. In some embodiments the first rejuvenating material <b>170</b> may be bitumen or a similar substance and the second rejuvenating material <b>170</b> may be water, a liquid, a gas, polymers, clay, wax, oil based substance, zeolites or combinations thereof. The mixing chamber <b>207</b> preferably comprises in-line agitating elements <b>209</b> to facilitate a more thorough mixing of the rejuvenating materials <b>170</b>. The in-line agitating elements <b>209</b> may comprise a variety of geometries designed to further agitate the materials together. The geometries may comprise a surface substantially perpendicular, diagonal or parallel to the flow of materials. There may be one in-line agitating element disposed within the member or there may be a plurality of elements <b>209</b>. The mixing chamber <b>207</b> may be incorporated into one of the channels <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> of the injectors <b>118</b> in the rake <b>114</b> of previous figures or the mixing chamber <b>207</b> may be located in the path between the supplies of rejuvenation material and the injectors <b>118</b>. Preferably the mixing of rejuvenating materials <b>170</b> takes place under high pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as previously mentioned, the asphalt recycling process described in the previous figures may be characterized by a method <b>1000</b> for recycling a roadway. The method <b>1000</b> includes the step of providing <b>1005</b> a channel attached to a vehicle adapted to traverse an area comprising a layer of pavement aggregate, the channel being in communication with at least one supply of pavement rejuvenation material. The method further includes the steps of positioning <b>1010</b> at least a portion of the channel within the layer and adding <b>1015</b> rejuvenation material into the layer from an opening in the channel positioned below the surface of the layer. The channel may be incorporated into the injector of a rake in a pavement recycling machine.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as previously mentioned, a more detailed method <b>1100</b> of recycling pavement is shown. The method <b>1100</b> includes the steps of forming <b>1105</b> a layer of pavement aggregate by degrading an asphalt surface and providing <b>1110</b> a channel attached to a vehicle adapted to traverse an area comprising the layer of pavement aggregate. The channel is in communication with at least one supply of pavement rejuvenation material, such as bitumen.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The method <b>1100</b> further includes the step of heating <b>1115</b> the at least one supply of pavement rejuvenation material and mixing <b>1120</b> the pavement rejuvenation material from the at least one supply with pavement rejuvenation material from a second supply under high pressure. The pavement rejuvenation material from the second supply may comprise water, a liquid, a gas, polymers, clay, wax, oil based substance, zeolites or combinations thereof. The pavement rejuvenation materials may foam under normal atmospheric pressures, so the high pressure mixing may prevent the pavement rejuvenation materials from foaming in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The channel is then positioned <b>1125</b> so that at least a portion of the channel is disposed within the layer and the pavement rejuvenation material is added <b>1130</b> into the layer from an opening in the channel positioned below the surface of the layer. The rejuvenation materials may foam as they exit the opening, lowering their overall viscosity and promoting more complete adhesion to the aggregate as the pavement rejuvenation material rises to the surface of the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the pavement rejuvenation material is added <b>1130</b> into the layer and adheres adequately to the aggregate, the aggregate is compacted <b>1135</b> to complete the main process. Final steps may also be taken such as sealing and finishing the roadway and collecting data on the finished roadway.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its essence or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description.
