<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to ground working equipment and, more particularly, to a compact, walk-behind machine of a dedicated or limited function, e.g., trenching.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ride-on and walk-behind loader vehicles are generally known in the art. One such vehicle is illustrated and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,223 to Walto et al. While exact designs may vary, these utility loaders typically include differential drive members to propel and turn the vehicle (e.g., skid-steer vehicles), and a forward-mounted attachment plate configured to receive an array of excavating or other ground working attachments. For example, lift buckets, augers, snow throwers, trenchers, and vibratory plows may couple to the attachment plate. The loader, in turn, may manipulate the attachment plate, and thus the attachment, as desired during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While extremely effective and versatile, these convertible loaders may be relatively sophisticated in their construction in order to accommodate and function with the broad range of potential attachments. For example, many walk-behind loaders include hydraulic lift cylinders that raise and lower the attachment plate relative to the ground, as well as one or more tilt cylinders to change the angle of inclination of the attachment plate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To address industry need, manufacturers have introduced simplified vehicles that accept fewer attachments or, in some instances, are designed for a single, dedicated use. For example, some landscape professionals may require only trenching capability (e.g., for burying irrigation pipe, conduit, and the like). An exemplary walk-behind trenching machine is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,221 to Hillard et al.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While different configurations exist, dedicated trenchers often include spaced-apart and independently powered drive wheels, and a forwardly extending boom pivotally attached to the trencher. The boom may include an endless trenching chain that moves along the boom, much like a chain saw, under power of a horizontal, driven trencher axle. Most dedicated trenchers, in addition to their smaller size, may incorporate simplified controls and hydraulic circuitry as compared to conventional convertible loaders with a trencher attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While effective for their intended use, many dedicated trenchers have drawbacks. For example, the trencher axle is typically located close to the ground to maximize trench depth relative to boom length. As a result, when the boom pivots upwardly (about the trencher axle) for transport, the rear, lower portion of the boom and chain remain in close proximity to the ground. In order to permit transport of the trencher in this configuration, e.g., traversal of curbs or ramped surfaces, and/or to accommodate a forwardly biased center of gravity, a trailing wheel is typically provided and located forward of the aft end of the boom. The trailing wheel is beneficial as it contacts elevated ground surfaces (e.g., curbs and ramps) first, thereby limiting or preventing ground contact of the lower portions of the raised boom during transport. The trailing wheel may provide other benefits including, for example, increased stability during transport and operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the trailing wheel may also, in some configurations, interfere with vehicle turning. For example, in order to turn some trenchers, the traction differential is typically released to first permit independent drive wheel movement. In order to permit transverse (turning) movement of the trailing wheel without turf scuffing, however, the operator usually applies a sufficient downward force to the control handle to lift the trailing wheel off the ground. While effective, repeated manipulation of the vehicle in this manner may become fatiguing. Furthermore, the trailing wheel may inadvertently drop into existing trenches and ruts when the latter are traversed by the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention may overcome these and other issues with conventional trenching machines by providing a walk-behind steerable trencher that, in one embodiment, includes: a frame; two independently powered and spaced-apart, ground-engaging drive members positioned on opposing sides of the frame; and a trenching boom. The trenching boom may include an elongate boom guide and an attachment arm defining a transverse pivot joint for pivotally attaching a proximal end of the boom guide to a forward portion of the frame, wherein the transverse pivot joint defines a first transverse axis. The boom may also include: an endless cutting element movable along a perimeter of the boom guide; and a drive unit for moving the cutting element along the perimeter of the boom guide, wherein the drive unit comprises a driven axle defining a second transverse axis that is offset from the first transverse axis. In this embodiment, the trencher may also include an actuator coupled between the frame and the trenching boom. The actuator is operable to pivot the trenching boom, about the first transverse axis, from an operating position, wherein a distal end of the boom is below a ground surface, to a transport position, wherein a lowermost portion of the cutting element is positioned above an inclined plane that extends upwardly, forwardly, and tangentially from a forwardmost portion of one of the ground-engaging drive members at an angle of 25 degrees or more from horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a walk-behind steerable trencher is provided that includes: a frame having a forward end, a rearward end, and opposing sides; two independently powered and spaced-apart, ground-engaging tracks positioned on the opposing sides of the frame; and a trenching boom. The trenching boom may include an elongate boom guide; an attachment arm defining a transverse pivot joint for pivotally attaching a proximal end of the boom guide to the forward end of the frame, wherein the transverse pivot joint defines a first transverse axis; an endless cutting element movable along a perimeter of the boom guide; and a drive unit for moving the cutting element along the perimeter of the boom guide. The drive unit may include a driven axle defining a second transverse axis that is offset from the first transverse axis. The trencher may, in this embodiment, also include an actuator coupled to both the frame and the trenching boom. The actuator is operable to pivot the trenching boom, about the first transverse axis, from an operating position, wherein a distal end of the boom is below a horizontal ground surface, to a transport position, wherein a lowermost portion of the cutting element is positioned at an elevation of 5 inches or more above the horizontal ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, a walk-behind steerable trencher is provided. The trencher may include: a frame; two independently powered and spaced-apart, ground-engaging drive members positioned on opposing sides of the frame; and a trenching boom. The trenching boom may include: an attachment arm having a rearward portion attached to the frame for pivotal movement of the arm, relative to the frame, about a transverse frame pivot axis; an elongate boom guide pivotally attached to a forward portion of the attachment arm for pivotal movement of the boom guide, relative to the arm, about a transverse boom pivot axis; an endless cutting element movable along a perimeter of the boom guide; and a drive unit for driving the cutting element along the perimeter of the boom guide, wherein the drive unit comprises a driven axle coincident with the boom pivot axis. In this embodiment, the trencher may also include an actuator coupled between the frame and the trenching boom, wherein the actuator is configured to move the trenching boom, via pivotal motion about both the frame pivot axis and the boom pivot axis, from an operating position, wherein a distal end of the boom is below a ground surface, to a transport position, wherein the boom is positioned at a sufficient elevation above the ground surface for trencher transport.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the present invention may be directed to normally walk-behind, self-propelled working vehicles used, for example, to perform ground grooming or ground working operations. In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the working vehicle is configured as a compact utility skid-steer vehicle which, in the illustrated embodiment, may be a dedicated walk-behind, steerable trenching vehicle <b>100</b> (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;trencher&#x201d;) as shown in the Figures. The trencher <b>100</b> may be used, e.g., by landscape contractors, to form trenches in a ground surface for burying various items including, for example, electrical cables and irrigation pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Those of skill in the art will realize that the trencher <b>100</b> is illustrative only as other embodiments of the present invention may be directed to vehicles configured for other dedicated and non-dedicated functions (e.g., tillers, snow throwers) as well as other vehicle configurations (e.g., ride-on vehicles, convertible loaders).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the trencher <b>100</b> may include a suitably shaped frame <b>102</b> having a forward end, a rearward end, and opposing sides. A power source, such as an internal combustion engine <b>104</b>, may be attached to the frame as illustrated. While the size of the engine <b>104</b> may vary depending on the particular trencher configuration, it may, in one embodiment, be approximately 10-25 horsepower. A muffler <b>106</b> may be provided and located to minimize exhaust output in the vicinity of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The trencher <b>100</b> may further include laterally spaced uprights <b>108</b> proximate a rear portion of the frame <b>102</b>. The uprights <b>108</b> may form a handle system of the trencher that supports the trencher control area <b>110</b> proximate the rearward end of the frame as further described below. For more information on standard trenching machine nomenclature, refer to SAE J1382 (1982).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Pivotally attached to a forward portion of the trencher <b>100</b> is a trenching boom <b>101</b>. The trenching boom <b>101</b>, as described below, is operable to form a trench in a ground surface (e.g., horizontal ground surface <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The boom <b>101</b> is movable between a fully extended or operating position (wherein a distal end of the boom is below a ground surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, which corresponds to the trencher being in an operating configuration) and a fully retracted or transport position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, corresponding to the trencher being in a transport configuration). As further described below, the boom <b>101</b> may include an offset attachment arm <b>103</b> that pivotally attaches a proximal end of an elongate boom guide <b>129</b> to a forward end or portion of the trencher frame <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The vehicle <b>100</b> may further include a traction system <b>112</b> that includes both left and right powered drive members (e.g., two independently powered and spaced-apart, ground engaging tracks <b>114</b> on opposing sides of the frame <b>102</b> (only left track visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>)) that are operable to propel or drive the trencher <b>100</b> along the ground surface <b>107</b>. While shown as tracks, other drive member configurations, e.g., wheels, are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. Each drive track <b>114</b> may be configured as an endless, flexible belt that is looped around a rear drive member or wheel <b>116</b> and at least one idler support member or wheel, e.g., forward idler wheel <b>118</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the rear drive wheel <b>116</b> is positioned at a higher elevation than the forward idler wheel <b>118</b>. In order to provide the desired track configuration and length, the traction system <b>112</b> may also include support wheels <b>118</b>&#x2032; and <b>118</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The forward idler wheel <b>118</b> may be adjustable in the fore-aft direction to alter the tension on the drive track <b>114</b> as needed. Each drive track <b>114</b> may include inwardly extending drive lugs (not shown) that engage apertures or openings formed in each of the rear drive wheels <b>116</b>. The drive lugs allow each wheel <b>116</b> to impart a driving force to its respective track to propel the trencher <b>100</b> in either the forward or reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (some structure removed for clarity), each drive wheel <b>116</b> may be driven by its own hydrostatic axle <b>120</b> coupled thereto (or by any other suitably motor or drive connection). Rotation of the rear drive wheels <b>116</b> (via the corresponding hydrostatic axle <b>120</b>) may result in linear movement of the respective drive tracks <b>114</b> via engagement of the drive lugs of the track with the rear drive wheel. As is known in the art, each hydrostatic axle <b>120</b> may rotate its respective rear drive wheel <b>116</b> in either a forward (counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or reverse (clockwise) direction to permit propelling of the trencher <b>100</b> either forwardly or in reverse. As each rear drive wheel <b>116</b> is powered by a separate hydrostatic axle <b>120</b>, steering control of the trencher <b>100</b> may be achieved by varying the relative rotational speed and/or direction of each wheel <b>116</b>, and thus the speed and direction of each track <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each hydrostatic axle <b>120</b> may be powered by a belt <b>119</b> coupled to a vertical drive or output shaft <b>121</b> of the engine <b>104</b>. A hydraulic pump <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may also be coupled to the output shaft <b>121</b> to power other components of the vehicle including an actuator, e.g., linear hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), for raising and lowering the boom <b>101</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cylinder <b>124</b> is coupled between the frame <b>102</b> and the trenching boom <b>101</b> and is operable to pivot the boom, about a first transverse pivot joint <b>132</b>, e.g., about a first transverse axis <b>133</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), from the operating position to the transport position as further described below. To achieve this, the cylinder <b>124</b> may have its first or base end pivotally connected to the frame <b>102</b> at a base pivot joint <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), and a second or rod end pivotally attached to the boom <b>101</b> (e.g., to the arm <b>103</b>) at a rod pivot joint <b>130</b>. The rod pivot joint <b>130</b> may be radially offset from the first transverse axis <b>133</b> as shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the cylinder is selectively extended, e.g., when a piston rod <b>134</b> of the hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> is extended, the boom <b>101</b> may pivot about the first transverse pivot joint <b>132</b>, e.g., about the axis <b>133</b>, such that the boom moves towards the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 3A</figref>. Similarly, when the cylinder <b>124</b> (e.g., piston rod <b>134</b>) is retracted, the boom <b>101</b> may pivot about the first transverse pivot joint <b>132</b>, e.g., about the axis <b>133</b>, such that it moves towards the transport position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 3B</figref>. In other embodiments, the cylinder <b>124</b> may be positioned (e.g., such that the rod pivot joint <b>130</b> is below the transverse pivot joint <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) such that extension of the cylinder <b>124</b> moves the boom <b>101</b> towards the transport position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The boom may further include a drive unit, e.g., hydraulic motor <b>126</b>. The drive unit may move (e.g., translate) an endless cutting element such as an endless trenching chain <b>127</b> along a perimeter of the boom guide <b>129</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the hydraulic motor <b>126</b> is powered by the pump <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The motor <b>126</b> may include a driven axle <b>125</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to rotate at least a sprocket (not shown) that, in turn drives or moves the endless cutting element, e.g., trenching chain <b>127</b>, along the perimeter of the boom guide <b>129</b> of the trenching boom <b>101</b>. The distal end of the boom guide <b>101</b> may include an idler sprocket (also not shown). The distance between the two sprockets may be varied, e.g., via an adjustment mechanism <b>131</b>, to control the tension in the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hydraulic fluid is ported from the pump <b>122</b> to the various hydraulic devices via conventional hydraulic conduits and/or hoses. However, for clarity, these conduits/hoses are not illustrated herein (although connection fittings may be illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> further illustrate various guards that may be optionally included with the trencher <b>100</b>. For example, a guard <b>136</b> may be attached to the boom <b>101</b> and move therewith between the operating and transport positions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The control area <b>110</b> may be positioned and organized so that an operator standing behind the trencher <b>100</b> may comfortably locate both hands within the control area during operation and transport. The control area <b>110</b> may include various levers and the like that control the trencher. For example, a lever <b>138</b> may be provided to permit extension and retraction of the cylinder <b>124</b> (e.g., lowering and raising of the boom <b>101</b>). In addition, the control area <b>110</b> may include a control handle <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) to control the traction system <b>112</b>. Various other controls, e.g., trenching motor, throttle, operator presence control (OPC), etc., may also be provided. More information regarding exemplary control systems may be found in the '223 (Walto et al.) patent.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are cutaway side elevation views of the trencher <b>100</b> in both the operating position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and the transport position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). During operation, the operator typically walks behind the trencher <b>100</b> in a manner similar to that of a walk-behind lawn mower. Upon reaching the work area, the operator may manipulate the controls, e.g., lever <b>138</b>, to extend the cylinder <b>124</b>. As the cylinder extends, the boom <b>101</b> may move towards the operating position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. While illustrated in its lowermost position in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the boom <b>101</b> may be located to produce a shallower trench by releasing the lever <b>138</b> when the boom reaches the desired depth. The trenching motor <b>126</b> may be actuated (e.g., via a control in the control area <b>110</b>) as the boom is lowered to allow initial penetration into the ground surface <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the trenching chain <b>127</b> moves along the guide <b>129</b> (as represented by arrow <b>142</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), it digs into the ground surface <b>107</b> and transports displaced earthen material (e.g., soil) upwardly towards the front of the trencher. This material may then be moved laterally away from the trencher boom <b>101</b> (e.g., to the right side of the trencher) by a horizontal auger <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) positioned laterally (e.g., offset to the side) from the proximal end of the boom and boom guide and coupled to a shaft powered by the motor <b>126</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sprocket that drives the trenching chain <b>127</b> is attached to, and coaxial with, an axle of the auger <b>144</b> (an exemplary sprocket is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,415,532 to Bricko et al.). As a result, as the trencher <b>100</b> is propelled in reverse, e.g., in the direction <b>146</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the elongate trench <b>109</b> may be formed in the ground surface <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the illustrated embodiment, the right track of the trencher <b>100</b> (opposite to the track in full view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) may be offset longitudinally (towards the rear of the unit as compared to the opposing left track) by a short distance, e.g., 2 inches. This offset may, among other advantages, better accommodate the auger <b>144</b> and dirt shield (the latter not shown) out to, or beyond, the edge of the trencher. In the illustrated embodiment, the right track is otherwise identical to (e.g., a mirror image of) the left track except for being subject to this rearward shift of 2 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At the completion of the trench forming operation, the operator may manipulate the lever <b>138</b> to cause the cylinder <b>124</b> to retract and move the boom <b>101</b> from the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to the transport position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Hydraulic flow to the motor <b>126</b> may be terminated before or during movement of the boom. With the boom <b>101</b> removed from the ground, the trencher may be maneuvered (e.g., turned, propelled forwardly or rearwardly, etc.) to position it at the correct location for the next trenching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In contrast to some trenching vehicles, the trencher <b>100</b> is able to achieve repositioning of the boom between the operating position and the transport position with the use of a single mechanism, e.g., cylinder <b>124</b>. Moreover, the trencher <b>100</b> is capable of both trenching operation and transport without the need for a conventional trailing wheel forward of the aft end of the boom.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">These capabilities are at least partially attributable to the geometry of the exemplary trencher <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. With reference to these figures, the offset attachment arm <b>103</b> of the boom <b>101</b> may be configured to pivot near an aft end of the arm, relative to the frame <b>102</b>, about the first transverse axis <b>133</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The motor <b>126</b> that drives the chain <b>127</b> and auger <b>144</b>, however, may be attached to a relatively more forward portion of the arm <b>103</b> (as viewed when the boom is in the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The driven axle <b>125</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the motor <b>126</b> may define a second transverse axis, e.g., a boom or trencher pivot axis <b>148</b>, that is parallel to, and offset from, the first transverse axis <b>133</b> by a distance <b>150</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Accordingly, the motor <b>126</b> and auger <b>144</b> may pivot, relative to the frame <b>102</b>, as the boom is moved. While the offset distance <b>150</b> may vary depending on the particular trencher configuration, it is in one embodiment about 10 inches. In this configuration, the hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> may displace or pivot the boom <b>101</b> at least about 100 degrees between the operating position and the transport position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a result of the offset pivot joint <b>132</b>, movement of the boom <b>101</b> between the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and the transport position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> results in pivotal movement of all portions of the boom <b>101</b> (including the motor <b>126</b>, chain <b>127</b>, and auger <b>144</b>) away from the ground. As a result, the trencher <b>100</b> has clearance adequate to permit traversal of various obstacles/surfaces without the need for the conventional trailing wheel. For example, when the trencher <b>100</b> is in the transport configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> (e.g., the boom <b>101</b> is in the transport position), a lowermost portion of the boom, e.g., the cutting element or chain <b>127</b>, may be positioned at an elevation of 5 inches or more above the horizontal ground surface <b>107</b>. As a result, it may traverse a curb <b>152</b> having a typical height <b>154</b> of 5 inches or more, e.g., about 6 inches, without any part of the trencher or boom bottoming out or otherwise scraping the curb.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Similarly, when the boom is in the transport position, a lowermost portion of the boom, e.g., the cutting element or chain <b>127</b>, is positioned above an inclined plane <b>156</b> that extends upwardly, forwardly, and tangentially from a forwardmost portion of one or both of the ground engaging tracks (e.g., the most forwardly positioned track) at an angle <b>158</b> of about 25 degrees or more from horizontal. As a result, the trencher <b>100</b> may climb an inclined surface, e.g., a trailer ramp, having an approach angle <b>158</b> of about 25 degrees or more, e.g., about 30 degrees, without any part of the trencher or boom bottoming out. Higher angles may be accommodated, but may be otherwise limited by various aspects (e.g., center of gravity) of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Elimination of the trailing wheel may provide additional benefits. For example, construction of the trencher may be simplified due to corresponding component elimination. Moreover, trenchers in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may be well suited for traversing existing trenches without concern for trailing wheel drop-in as may occur with some trailing wheel configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments of the present invention may furthermore incorporate vertical engine <b>104</b> mounting, potentially providing for more compact and efficient hydraulic and drive belt routing, as well as desirable visibility of the trenching area. As a result, a short and compact trencher may be provided. For instance, in one exemplary embodiment, the trencher <b>100</b> has a track length <b>157</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) of about 23 inches (measured from centers of the front and rear idler wheels <b>118</b>) and a track width <b>159</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of about 33.2 inches. In one embodiment, a center of gravity (CG) of the trencher <b>100</b> is located longitudinally within the span of both tracks. For instance, with a two foot boom <b>101</b> (and chain) and the boom in the transport position, the CG (see reference numeral <b>160</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) may be located rearward of the axle of the left front wheel <b>118</b> (the most forward wheel <b>118</b>) by a distance of about 15.5 inches. It may further be located transversely about 2 inches left of center and at an elevation of about 17.5 inches from the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate a trencher <b>200</b> in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the trencher <b>200</b> is generally configured the same as the trencher <b>100</b> already described herein. However, the trencher <b>200</b> may additionally include an optional fill blade <b>300</b>. The fill blade <b>300</b> may attach, e.g., permanently or temporarily, to a frame <b>202</b> of the trencher. The fill blade <b>300</b> may be moved, e.g., pivoted, between an operating position or location as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, and a storage position or location as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In the operating position, the fill blade <b>300</b> may extend obliquely from one side of the trencher and be close to or in contact with the ground surface. As the trencher <b>200</b> moves in the forward direction <b>147</b> parallel to, but offset from (e.g., along the side of), the trench (not shown), the fill blade <b>300</b> may push dirt and other earthen material previously removed by the trencher in the direction <b>149</b> and back into the trench (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In the storage location, the fill blade <b>300</b>, while still attached to the trencher, may extend upwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The blade <b>300</b> may be immobilized or locked in either the storage or operating location by a pair of pins <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> that couple to the frame <b>202</b> of the trencher <b>200</b>. For example, the blade <b>300</b> may include shaped openings or hubs (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) through which the two angled pins <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> pass. In the operating location, the pins <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may, via the shaped openings, lock the blade <b>300</b> in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Even when locked in the operating position, however, the blade <b>300</b> may slide or translate upwardly and downwardly along the pins <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to allow the blade to traverse ground undulations. To move the blade to the storage location, the lower pin <b>302</b> may be removed and the blade <b>300</b> pivoted about the upper pin <b>304</b> to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. At this point, the lower pin <b>302</b> may be reinserted into another hub or opening in the blade to secure or lock it in the storage location. While described herein as a dual pin mechanism, other embodiments, e.g., simple pivoting configurations, are certainly possible without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate a vehicle, e.g., trencher <b>400</b>, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Except where noted below, the trencher <b>400</b> may be configured in a manner substantially similar to the trencher <b>100</b> already described above and, as a result, further description of common aspects is not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Unlike the trencher <b>100</b>, however, the trencher <b>400</b> may include a trenching boom <b>401</b> that attaches to the trencher via a dual pivot mechanism. For instance, the boom <b>401</b> may, once again, include an attachment arm <b>403</b> and a boom guide <b>429</b>. However, in this embodiment, the boom guide is pivotally attached to a forward portion of the arm <b>403</b> such that the boom <b>401</b> (e.g., boom guide <b>429</b>) may also pivot, relative to the arm, about a second transverse or boom pivot axis <b>448</b> (the latter which may be coincident with a driven axle <b>425</b> of a trenching motor <b>426</b>). Like the arm <b>103</b>, the arm <b>403</b> may, in turn, have a rearward portion pivotally attached to a frame <b>402</b> of the trencher <b>400</b> at a first transverse pivot joint <b>432</b> for pivotal movement of the arm, relative to the frame, about a first transverse or frame pivot axis <b>433</b> that, in one embodiment, is parallel to the boom pivot axis <b>448</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The boom <b>401</b> may be movable between an operating position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and a transport position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> via a hydraulic cylinder <b>424</b> that is substantially similar to the cylinder <b>124</b> described above. The cylinder may attach to the frame <b>402</b> of the trencher <b>400</b> at a base pivot joint <b>428</b> and to the boom, e.g., boom guide <b>429</b>, at a rod pivot joint <b>430</b>. By extending and retracting a piston rod <b>434</b> of the cylinder <b>424</b> as described above with reference to the trencher <b>100</b> and cylinder <b>124</b>, the boom <b>401</b> (e.g., boom guide <b>429</b>) may be moved between the operating and transport positions via pivotal motion about both the frame pivot axis <b>433</b> and the boom pivot axis <b>448</b> as further described below. Controls for the hydraulic cylinder <b>424</b> (as well as other systems of the trencher <b>400</b>) may be located in a control area <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">During transport, the trencher <b>400</b> may be configured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Upon reaching the trenching site, the boom <b>401</b> could be lowered by extending the hydraulic cylinder <b>424</b>. In one embodiment, as the cylinder extends, the guide <b>429</b> may begin to pivot (e.g., counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) about the boom pivot axis <b>448</b>. When a first contact or stop surface <b>462</b> of the guide <b>429</b> contacts a second contact or stop surface <b>464</b> of the arm <b>403</b>, the arm <b>403</b> may begin to pivot, in the counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, about the frame pivot axis <b>433</b> of the pivot joint <b>432</b>. Further extension of the hydraulic cylinder may result in the boom <b>401</b> moving fully to the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To return the boom <b>401</b> to the transport position (or any position between the operating position and the transport position), the hydraulic cylinder <b>424</b> may be retracted. As the cylinder retracts, the arm <b>403</b> may begin to move in the clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> about the frame pivot axis <b>433</b> of the pivot joint <b>432</b>. Once the arm <b>403</b> reaches its limit, the guide <b>429</b> may begin to pivot, clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, until a third contact or stop surface <b>466</b> of the guide contacts a fourth contact or stop surface <b>468</b> of the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is noted that, while described herein as moving in a particular order, those of skill in the art will note that both the boom <b>429</b> and the arm <b>403</b> may move in a difference sequence or even in unison. In fact, in a different embodiment (e.g., the illustrated embodiment), the arm <b>403</b> may be biased for movement downwardly (in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) about the pivot joint <b>432</b>, e.g., via a rotating cam lock or a biasing member such as a spring. As a result, the arm <b>403</b> may pivot first about the pivot joint <b>432</b> when the boom <b>401</b> is moved from the transport position towards the operating position. After the arm reaches its lower position, e.g., an abutting surface <b>470</b> of the arm <b>403</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) contacts a corresponding abutting surface the frame <b>402</b>, pivoting of the boom guide about the boom pivot axis <b>448</b> may commence. Stated another way, the arm <b>403</b> may &#x201c;bottom out&#x201d; in travel before pivoting of the boom guide <b>429</b> about the boom pivot axis <b>448</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Similarly, when the boom <b>401</b> is moved from a lower position (e.g., the operating position) towards the transport position, the bias of the arm <b>403</b> may cause the boom (e.g., boom guide) to initially pivot about the boom pivot axis <b>448</b> until the third contact surface <b>466</b> contacts the fourth contact surface <b>468</b>. After contact between the surfaces <b>466</b> and <b>468</b>, the boom may pivot about the pivot joint <b>432</b> as it moves towards the transport position. The upward position of the boom <b>401</b> may be limited by either the stroke of the cylinder <b>424</b>, or by contact between surfaces of the arm <b>403</b> and the frame <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The latter biased arm configuration ensures that all or most of the operating positions of the boom (e.g., operating positions short of the full down position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) will still locate the axis <b>448</b> (and thus the auger (see, e.g., auger <b>144</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>)) close to the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The trencher <b>400</b> is configured to locate the boom in a transport position that is similar to that described with respect to the trencher <b>100</b>, e.g., positioned to traverse a curb of 5 inches or more in height or climb an incline of 25 degrees or more without bottoming out.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As stated elsewhere herein, while the invention is described in the context of a dedicated trencher, alternative embodiments may encompass other types of vehicles. For instance, the vehicle could be configured substantially as shown, but with an attachment plate in place of the boom. The attachment plate could be configured to receive a variety of attachments as are already known in the art.</p>
