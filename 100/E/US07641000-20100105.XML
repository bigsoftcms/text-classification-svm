<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to a boring system for horizontal drilling; and more specifically to a device and method of boring through a variety of soil types ranging from compressible soils to hard rock.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Horizontal drilling systems currently in use include technology known as mud motor technology, pipe-in-pipe technology, rotary steerable devices, and hammer technology. Each system has inherent limitations related to the system's operation and method of use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mud motor technology utilizes drilling fluid to transfer power from a drill rig located at a ground surface, through a drill string comprised of inter-connected drill rods, to a down-hole motor. The drill string is connected to the rear end of the mud motor is connected; while a drill bit, attached to an output shaft, is connected to a front end of the mud motor. The drill bit is powered rotationally by torque generated by drilling fluid passing through the motor. The drill bit can thus be rotated, while the drill string is held from rotating. Directional control is achieved by the addition of an offset coupling that offsets the center-line of the drill bit from the center-line of the drill string and mud motor. In particular, to control the direction of the drill bit, the drill string is held from rotating, and the drill bit rotated by the mud motor. The drill sting then moves the assembly longitudinally forward, creating a bored hole in the direction of the centerline of the drill bit. To bore a straight hole, the drill string, mud motor and offset coupling are all rotated to create a bored hole in the direction of the centerline of the drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One limitation of mud motors is related to the capacity to transmit power to the drill bit. Since the drill string is not rotationally secured to the drill bit, the mud motor must provide the rotational power to the bit. The length of the motor is typically a function of the rotational power provided to the bit. In some applications, the length required to develop sufficient torque is significant. Further, the construction of mud motors is such that they are typically less flexible than the drill rod. This combination of length and stiffness can limit the directional control capability of mud motor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A second inherent limitation of mud motors is related to the use of the drilling fluid to provide rotational power to the drill bit. Since mud flow rate and pressure determine the power transferred to the drill bit, the rate and pressure must be maintained in order to maintain drilling speed. In some situations, other aspects of drilling are affected by the flow rate of the drilling mud, and it may be desirable to reduce either the flow rate or the pressure. These situations compromise the efficiencies of the contrasting aspects of a drilling operation. For instance, a &#x201c;frac-out&#x201d; can occur as a result of excessive flow or excessive pressure of the drilling fluid. A frac-out situation is where drilling fluid is forced though a fracture in the ground rather than through the bored hole. In a frac-out situation, it is desirable to reduce flow rate or fluid pressure to cease further expansion of the ground fracture. Preferably, the flow rate and pressure are at an initially reduced level to prevent the probability of a frac-out altogether. However, reducing the flow rate and pressure negatively affects drilling performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A third inherent limitation is related to the need for the drill bit to be offset from the centerline of the mud motor. This offset requires a complicated drive shaft assembly in order to transfer the rotary power through the offset. The drill bit is mounted to the drive shaft, which is inherently more flexible than the motor housing. The resulting assembly has several limitations including significant initial cost associated with the complicated assembly, limited durability, and a flexibility that can affect the dynamic stability of the drill bit during drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Pipe-in-pipe technology operates in a similar fashion. The drill bit is oriented at an end of an outer drill string with a center that is offset with respect to the center of the outer drill string. An inner pipe rotationally powers the drill bit independent from rotation of the outer drill string. To achieve directional control of the drill bit, the outer drill string is held from rotating while the inner drill pipe rotates the drill bit. The drill string is then moved forward to create a bored hole in the direction of the offset. To bore a straight hole, the outer drill string, the inner drip pipe and the drill bit are all rotated to create a bored hole in the direction of the centerline of the outer drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One limitation of this technology relates to the size of the component that provides rotational power to the drill bit, i.e., the inner pipe. Because the diameter of the inner pipe is smaller that the outer drill string, the maximum torque that can be transferred to the drill bit is less than the maximum torque that could be transferred by the outer drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second limitation of pipe-in-pipe technology is related to the inherent flow restriction of the pipe-in-pipe configuration. Drilling fluid is required to cool the drill bit and to transfer the cuttings out of the bored hole. The rate of drilling can be limited by the fluid flow rate. The cross-sectional area of the inner drill pipe, which is used to transfer the fluid, is less than the cross-sectional area of the outer drill string. Thus, the maximum flow rate is lower, or the fluid pressure at the drill rig is higher for a given flow rate, with a pipe-in-pipe system as compared to other systems utilizing the outer drill string for fluid transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Rotary steerable devices include a down-hole housing mounted on the drill string on bearings such that the housing can remain stationary while the drill string rotates. A drill bit is powered rotationally by an extension of the drill string and a drive shaft that extends through the down-hole housing. The down-hole housing has some form of offset to subject the drill bit to an unbalanced load condition, causing it to change the direction of the borehole. The orientation of the down-hole housing determines the boring direction of drill bit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A limitation of rotary steerable devices is related to the fact that there is a non-fixed relationship between the down-hole housing and the drill string. Many designs have been developed to control of the position of the housing relative to the drill string. Typically the designs involve manipulating the drill string. Any change in orientation of the down-hole housing in relation to the drill string during general operation will affect the direction of the bored hole. Changes in orientation of the housing relative to the drill string are unpredictable making operation complicated and the results unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Hammer technology utilizes drilling fluid to transfer power from the drill rig at the surface, through a drill string comprised of inter-connected drill rods, to a down-hole hammer. The drill string is connected to a rear end of the hammer. A drill bit, attached to an output shaft of the hammer, is connected at a front-end of the hammer. The drill bit is powered longitudinally with impact impulses from the hammer. The drill bit is able to cut through hard materials such as rock, without requiring full rotation of the drill bit. To achieve directional control, the drill string is oscillated rather than rotated. For example, the drill string can be oscillated slightly while the drill bit is cutting with the impact impulses generated by the fluid activated hammer to control the direction of boring. Specifically, the drill bit is oriented in manner such that an effective center of the bit is offset from the center of the drill string while the drill string is moved forward. To bore a straight hole, the drill string, the hammer, and the drill bit are all rotated to create a bored hole in the direction of the centerline of the drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A limitation of the hammer technology is related to the capability of the drilling fluid, used with currently available hammers, to carry cuttings. Commercially available hammers useful for this type of horizontal boring are activated with compressed air. The capability of compressed air to carry and transport sizable cuttings is less than the capability of drill mud used with either mud motors or pipe-in-pipe technology. Further, the maximum length of a bored hole is limited by the capability of the fluid to transfer the cuttings a particular distance.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, a need exists for a versatile drilling tool that reduces the effect of the above noted limitations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention the drill string includes both an offset coupling and a novel boring head such that torque is transferred through the drill string and through the offset coupling to a rotary drill bit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with another aspect of the present operation a directional bore can be made in both compressible soils and hard rock.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the rotational torque and longitudinal forces acting on the drill bit are transferred exclusively mechanically, through the drill rod, independent of the drilling fluid. This aspect allows the flow rate and pressure of the drilling fluid to be controlled to optimize its capacity to cool the drill bit and carry the cuttings, while minimizing the potential negative effects of excessive drilling fluid flow rate or pressure. The fluid can further be tailored and utilized to aid the cutting for certain soil types.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a symmetrical drill bit can be utilized, with the novel boring head, to bore either in alignment with, as an extension of the drill string, or deviated from that direction, while using the drill bit in a consistent manner. In both cases the drill bit is rotated in only one direction, the bit is never rotated in reverse. Since the method of operating the drill bit, uni-directional rotation, is consistent, the resulting bore hole will also be a consistent cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the method utilized for boring in a desired direction, a direction that deviates from the extension of the drill string, includes rotation of the drill string. This rotation results in minimizing frictional drag forces acting on the drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a variety of bits can be utilized, allowing an optimized bit to be used, one matching the requirements of the particular soil type being bored.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the requirements of the drill rig are not changed from those of a standard drill rig, allowing the present invention to be utilized with standard drill rigs.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention, together with the further objects and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals identify like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a drilling machine or rig <b>10</b> is positioned at the surface, connected to and driving a drill string <b>20</b> that extends to a boring head <b>100</b>. The drilling rig typically is capable of rotating the drill string and also capable of forcing the drill string longitudinally away from the drilling rig, extending the length of the bore, which will be referred to herein as thrust. The drilling rig is likewise capable of pulling the drill string back towards the drilling rig, shortening the drill string, which will be referred to herein as pullback.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The drilling rig <b>10</b> is normally used to form a pilot bore from an entry point, extending through the ground, along a planned route, to avoid underground obstacles and terminating at an exit point. During operation, the drilling rig <b>10</b> rotates and pushes the drill string <b>20</b> and boring head <b>100</b> into contact with the ground. The operation includes two basic types of steering or drilling modes: straight and deviated. In the straight mode, the bored hole is extended in a direction parallel and coaxial with a longitudinal axis of the drill string <b>20</b>. In the deviated mode, the bored hole is extended in a direction that is angled from the longitudinal axis of the drill string <b>20</b>. For example, the direction of the bored hole may be angled or deviated relative to the longitudinal axis of the drill string in an upward direction (known as a 12:00 direction), a downward direction (known as a 6:00 direction), a leftward direction (known as a 9:00 direction), or a rightward direction (known as a 3:00 direction). Using both modes of drilling, combined with electronic detection systems located at the boring head, operators can selectively direct a boring operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When a pilot bore has been completed by a boring operation, a product, such as a water line or an electrical cable, is attached to the drill string and pulled back through the bored hole. During the pull back operation, the size of bored hole is enlarged, as necessary to provide adequate clearance for utility components.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a typical installation, the initial ground conditions include generally compressible soils. As the bore progresses, it is not unusual for the ground conditions to change to include more difficult conditions, including rock or hard compacted soils. The boring head <b>100</b> of the present disclosure provides advantages in having an ability to bore through the variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A first embodiment of the boring head <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The boring head <b>100</b> includes a sonde housing <b>30</b>, an offset coupling or adaptor <b>40</b>, and a bit drive element <b>105</b>. The bit drive element <b>105</b> includes an outer drive housing <b>110</b>, a one-way clutch <b>115</b>, a bit drive adaptor <b>120</b> and thrust bearings <b>125</b>. The one-way clutch <b>115</b> is a well-known mechanical device that includes components that permit transfer of rotational torque in one rotary direction while allowing free rotation in the opposite direction. Exemplary one-way clutches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,619 to Kuroda, U.S. Pat. No. 4,546,864 to Hagen et. al, and U.S. Pat. RE38,498 to Ruth, et. al. A preferred commercially available unit is currently produced by Ringspann, and is marketed as a Freewheel Element. The example one-way clutch <b>115</b> illustrated is configured to slide into an inner bore <b>112</b> of outer drive housing <b>110</b>, and to be secured with retainers <b>114</b>. The one-way clutch <b>115</b> has an inner bore <b>117</b> configured to accept a drive shaft <b>122</b> of the bit drive adaptor <b>120</b>. The inner bore <b>112</b> of the outer drive housing <b>110</b> is further configured to accept the thrust bearings <b>125</b> in a manner such that thrust loads from the drill string <b>20</b> are transferred to the bit drive adaptor <b>120</b> separate from or independent of rotational loads.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the boring head <b>100</b> with all components assembled, and including a tri-cone roller bit <b>130</b> connected to the bit drive element <b>105</b>. The bit drive element <b>105</b> is attached to the offset adaptor <b>40</b>. The offset adaptor <b>40</b> includes a first end <b>42</b> and a second opposite end <b>44</b>. The first end <b>42</b> of the offset adaptor is attached to the sonde housing <b>30</b> and adjacent to the drill string <b>20</b>. The second end <b>44</b> of the offset adaptor is attached to the bit drive element <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first end <b>42</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b> defines a first axis <b>102</b> that is offset from a second axis <b>133</b> of the second end <b>44</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b>. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the first axis <b>102</b> angled from the second axis <b>133</b>. The amount of offset can be fixed or adjustable. An adaptor having an adjustable configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,463 to Livingstone et al., incorporated herein by reference, wherein the angle is adjustable by rotating a first end relative to a second end of the adaptor prior to locking the two ends together.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The tri-cone roller bit <b>130</b> is a well-known drilling tool and generally includes a bit pin <b>132</b>. The bit pin <b>132</b> is configured to engage a box <b>124</b> of the bit drive adaptor <b>120</b>. The tri-cone roller bit <b>130</b> defines an axis of rotation <b>134</b> that is coaxial with the second axis <b>133</b> of the second end <b>44</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b>. Typically, the tri-cone roller bit <b>130</b> is structurally symmetrical about the axis of rotation <b>134</b>, and includes a cutting face oriented perpendicular to and symmetrical about the axis of rotation <b>134</b>. When rotated and longitudinally forced forward, the tri-cone roller bit <b>130</b> will form a bored hole concentric to the axis of rotation <b>134</b>. Typically, roller cone bits are configured to be rotated in one direction, and configured to provide consistent full face cutting when rotated consistently in this one direction. Partial rotation or incomplete rotation can result in reduced consistency or unacceptable performance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The boring head <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is configured to be operated in two different modes: a first mode involving continuous full rotation of the drill string <b>20</b> for straight drilling; and a second mode involving interrupted rotation of the drill string <b>20</b> for deviated drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While in the first or straight drilling mode, the drill head <b>100</b>, including the bit <b>130</b>, is continuously rotated by the drill string <b>20</b>, about the first axis <b>102</b>. In this mode, the second axis <b>133</b>, and the cutting face of the bit <b>130</b>, rotate about the first axis <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the bit <b>130</b> rotates about the axis of rotation <b>134</b> while also revolving about the first axis <b>102</b>. The direction of advancement of the bored hole is generally parallel to the first axis <b>102</b> (i.e. the longitudinal axis of the drill string <b>20</b>). As the drill string <b>20</b> rotates, an offset side <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), that is, the axially offset second end <b>44</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b> rotates through a full rotation defining a maximum radius of the bored hole. The offset side <b>46</b> typically includes kick pads or wear pads (not shown) constructed of wear resistant material, and constructed in a manner to permit replacement or modification. In applications using an adjustable offset adaptor <b>40</b>, the angular offset can be selected such that the offset side <b>46</b> will contact the full circular outer diameter of the bored hole, and the maximum radius will be equal to or more than the diameter of the bored hole.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While in the second or deviated drilling mode, the drill string <b>20</b> is oscillated through a steering arc. To create the steering arc, the drill string <b>20</b> is oscillated through a steering arc sequence. The steering arc sequence includes, for example, rotating the drill string <b>20</b> in a first direction for a partial rotation (for instance, a partial rotation of +45 degrees), then rotating the drill string <b>20</b> in a second reversed direction for a partial rotation (for instance, a partial rotation of &#x2212;90 degrees). At this point the drill string is in a position of &#x2212;45 degrees. From this position, the steering arc sequence is repeated. As the drill string <b>20</b> continues to oscillate through this steering arc sequence, the one-way clutch <b>110</b> functions to allow the bit drive adaptor <b>120</b> and drill bit <b>130</b> to be rotated in a single direction, i.e., in the first direction, in an interrupted manner. In particular, the one-way clutch <b>115</b> allows the drill bit <b>130</b> to remain stationary when the drill string <b>20</b> is rotated in the reverse direction, while permitting rotation of the drill bit <b>130</b> with the drill string <b>20</b> in the first forward direction. Thus, when the drill string <b>20</b> is oscillated rotationally back and forth within the steering arc, the bit <b>130</b> and bit face will rotate uni-directionally about axis of rotation <b>134</b>, while the offset side <b>46</b> of offset adaptor <b>40</b> remains in the steering arc. As the drill string is moved longitudinally forward during this rotational oscillation, the offset side <b>46</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b>, and the corresponding side of the bit drive element <b>105</b> will contact the outer diameter of the bored hole, creating a steering force. Accordingly, the bored hole will advance approximately parallel to the second axis <b>133</b>, and angled or deviated from the first axis <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The size of the steering arc may affect how aggressively the system is able to steer. A smaller arc will tend to have more aggressive steering. The size of the steering arc will also affect the speed at which the drill bit can be rotated. With a steering arc of 90 degrees, the drill string will oscillate four times for each rotation of the drill bit. With a steering arc of 180 degrees, the drill string will oscillate two times for each rotation of the drill bit. The steering arc will preferably range between 45 degrees to 270 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the drill string; more preferably, the steering arch is between 60 degrees to 180 degrees so that the speed of rotation of the drill bit and the steering characteristics are more acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The direction of the boring process is controlled by positioning the offset side <b>46</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b> to the side opposite the desired angular direction. For instance, if the desired boring direction is upward, or in a 12:00 direction, the offset side <b>46</b> will be positioned downward, or at a 6:00 position. The position is measured by a sonde <b>32</b> (schematically represented by a line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) positioned within the sonde housing <b>30</b>. Exemplary illustrations of a sonde are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,442 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,680, both incorporated herein by reference. The rotational position of the sonde <b>32</b> is typically calibrated with the orientation of the offset side <b>46</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b>. This can be accomplished in any manner. One such calibration option, disclosed in co-assigned U.S. application 20030131992, and incorporated herein by reference, includes the steps of assembling the components prior to final installation of the sonde, and orienting the sonde in relation to offset side <b>46</b> such that the sonde will read the clock position directly opposite the clock position of the offset side <b>46</b>. In this method, the clock position is an indication of the direction that the boring will progress. Many other options could be performed to aid the accuracy of this step, including the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,708,782, which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In both modes of drilling, a longitudinal force from the drill string <b>20</b> is applied to the drill bit <b>130</b> to cause the bored hole to advance. In the straight drilling mode, the longitudinal force may be held constant. An advantage of the present invention, provided by the function of the one-way clutch, is that this longitudinal force can be applied in the same manner during deviated drilling. However, during deviated drilling, the longitudinal force during rotation in the second reverse direction is not required. Longitudinal forces are generally only required during rotation in the first direction for advancing the bored hole. It may be advantageous in some conditions to reduce or eliminate longitudinal forces during reverse rotation. For example eliminating longitudinal forces during reverse rotation reduces the wear rate on the offset side <b>46</b> of the offset coupling <b>40</b>. Either method of eliminating/reducing longitudinal forces or holding longitudinal forces constant can be used in conjunction with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the boring head <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is illustrated with drag cutting bit <b>135</b>. One example of a drag cutting bit <b>135</b> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,138,780 to Beuerhausen, which is herein incorporated by reference. This style of bit cuts in a symmetrical manner similar to that of the roller cone bit <b>130</b>. The cutting action of the drag bit <b>135</b> however is much different than the roller cone bit, and often times requires more torque and longitudinal force. To address the torque characteristics of the drag bit <b>135</b>, the drilling head of the present disclosure may include means to limit torque fluctuations resulting from use of the drag bit. One example of a means to limit torque fluctuations is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,163 to Tibbitts, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In certain conditions, the drag bits <b>135</b> offer advantages, while in other conditions, the roller cone bits <b>130</b> offer advantages. With either type of bit, there are benefits to the ability to operate with symmetrical bits. Thus, the drill head <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is illustrated with symmetrical bits. It is contemplated, nonetheless, that the drill head <b>100</b> can be used with any type of drill bit, including non-symmetrical bits.</p>

The illustrated hammer <b>150</b> includes a sliding component <b>152</b> that oscillates back and forth by fluid as the fluid is forced through the hammer. The sliding component oscillates to impact against a holder <b>154</b>. The resulting impact force assists the boring action. In the arrangement illustrated, the hammer <b>150</b> is located adjacent to the first end <b>42</b> of the offset adapter <b>40</b>.

This configuration would require a different offset adaptor <b>240</b>, including a drive shaft <b>242</b>, and could incorporate any of the previously described bits (e.g. roller cone bit, spiral bit, drag-cutting bit).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a fifth embodiment of a boring head <b>500</b> of the present disclosure wherein the offset adaptor <b>245</b> is constructed to offset the second axis <b>133</b> and the axis of rotation <b>134</b> of the drill bit from the first axis <b>102</b>, while keeping the axes parallel. The offset adapter <b>245</b> includes a reaction surface <b>247</b> that causes the direction of the bored hole to deviate. The reaction surface <b>247</b> may include kick pads or wear pads (not shown). All other aspects of the boring head <b>500</b> are similar to the features previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">One aspect of the present disclosure is the simplicity of varying operation between the two drilling modes, i.e., the straight drilling mode and the deviated drilling mode. In particular, the only required difference between the two modes is the method of rotating the drill string <b>20</b>. In straight drilling mode, the drill string <b>20</b> is rotated continuously; while for the deviated drilling mode, the drill string <b>20</b> is oscillated. In both modes, the drill string is thrust forward to maintain an appropriate longitudinal force on the drill bit, sometimes referred to as the weight of bit (WOB).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drilling rig <b>10</b> typically includes a diesel motor that powers a hydraulic pump, and an operator station with controls that allow the operator to control the hydraulic system, the flow rate and flow direction of oil transferred to rotation motors. The rotation motors cause the drill string <b>20</b> to rotate and force the drill string to extend, during boring, or retract, during backreaming.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The longitudinal movement of the drill string <b>20</b> is typically accomplished by attaching the drill string <b>20</b> to a gearbox. The gearbox is supported for linear movement along a rack. The linear movement is typically provided by a hydraulic cylinder or by a hydraulic motor, pinion gear and rack gear. These mechanisms are not illustrated as they are well known and any configuration can be used. The rotation of the gearbox is typically provided by a hydraulic motor that is mounted to the gearbox.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">One embodiment of a gearbox <b>600</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Rotation motors <b>602</b> (schematically represented) couple to a cross-shaft <b>604</b>, wherein the motors serve to support and rotationally drive the cross-shaft <b>604</b>. Typically, the motors <b>602</b> and the cross-shaft <b>604</b> are coupled by a splined connection (not shown). A pinion gear <b>606</b> is mounted onto the cross-shaft <b>604</b> and mates with a drive gear <b>608</b> mounted to a drive shaft <b>610</b>. The drive shaft <b>610</b> is attached to an adaptor <b>612</b> that connects to the drill string <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The gearbox <b>600</b>, as illustrated, includes a drive arrangement that provides the two modes of drilling operation of the present disclosure. The drive shaft <b>610</b> can be driven in continuous rotation, to provide for the straight drilling mode, and can be driving in interrupted rotation, to provide for the deviated drilling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the straight drilling mode, a shift fork <b>650</b> shifts a coupler <b>614</b> in a direction represented by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to a first position. In the first position, the coupler <b>614</b> engages the drive gear <b>608</b>. In particular, a first inner coupling <b>616</b> of the coupler <b>614</b> engages with an outer coupling <b>618</b> of the drive gear <b>608</b>, when the coupler <b>614</b> is moved towards the drive gear <b>608</b> by the shift fork <b>650</b>. The drive gear <b>608</b> is configured to allow free-rotation on drive shaft <b>610</b>, for instance with a bushing or bearing (not shown). The coupler <b>614</b> is secured to the drive shaft <b>610</b> with splines that allow the coupler <b>614</b> to be moved longitudinally, while being secured rotationally. When the coupler <b>614</b> moves so that the first inner coupling <b>616</b> is engaged with the outer coupling <b>618</b> of the drive gear <b>608</b>, torque is transferred from the rotation motors <b>602</b>, through the cross-shaft <b>604</b>, through the pinion gear <b>606</b>, the drive gear <b>608</b>, the coupler <b>614</b>, and to drive shaft <b>610</b>. The drive shaft <b>610</b> thereby provides the continuous rotation of the drill string <b>20</b> for the straight drilling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The second drilling mode of operation is provided when the shift fork <b>650</b> moves or shifts the coupler <b>614</b> in a direction represented by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to a second position. In the second position, a second inner coupling <b>620</b> of the coupler <b>214</b> engages with an outer coupling <b>622</b> of a crank arm <b>624</b>. When in this position, torque is transferred from the rotation motors <b>602</b>, through an offset section <b>628</b> of the cross-shaft <b>604</b>, translated into a force transferred through a rod <b>626</b>, and applied to the crank arm <b>624</b> where it is transferred into a torque in the drive shaft <b>610</b>. The drive shaft <b>610</b> will thus be oscillated, as required for the deviated drilling mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c </i>illustrate the range of travel of the drive shaft <b>610</b>, alternating back and forth through an angle of approximately 120 degrees, as the cross-shaft <b>604</b> rotates continuously, when the coupler <b>614</b> is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the gearbox <b>600</b> of the disclosed embodiment is described in operation with a coupler <b>614</b> configured to slide, allowing selective operational engagement of either the gear <b>608</b> or the crank arm <b>624</b>, it is recognized that other selective engagement techniques could be used, including but not limited to a hydraulically actuated clutch pack for both the gear <b>608</b> or the crank arm <b>624</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">To select between the two modes of drilling operation, the operator need only select between the two positions of the coupler <b>614</b>. All other operations for boring are identical. The position of the coupler <b>614</b> is controlled by the shift fork <b>650</b>, shown partially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a rod <b>652</b> provides support for the shift fork <b>650</b>. (In this illustration, the shift fork <b>650</b> is aligned with the coupler <b>614</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). An interlock hub <b>654</b> and an interlock bar <b>660</b> cooperate to sequence the oscillating motion of the drive shaft <b>610</b>. This sequencing function allows the operator to shift between the straight drilling mode and the deviated drilling mode, in a manner to reliably control the steering direction. The sequence process includes operating the gearbox <b>600</b> in a straight drilling mode, which allows the operator to rotate the drill head <b>100</b> to a selected rotational position corresponding to a desired deviation direction. Once in the selected rotational position, the drill head <b>100</b>-<b>400</b> is preferably oscillated about the selected rotational position, i.e., the selected rotational position becomes the center position about which the drill head is oscillated. For instance, if the deviation direction corresponds to a 3:00 direction, and a steering arc of 120 degrees, then the drill head should oscillate between a 1:00 position and a 5:00 position. In order to achieve oscillation between these positions, the coupler <b>614</b> must be shifted to engage with the crank arm <b>624</b> in only one position corresponding to the 3:00 direction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a shifting mechanism <b>680</b> for the coupler <b>614</b>. The shifting mechanism <b>680</b> include the shift fork <b>650</b> secured to the shift rod <b>652</b>. One type of connection that secures the shift fork <b>650</b> and the shift rod <b>652</b> may include a key and clamped boss arrangement. The details of this type of connection are well known, and are not illustrated herein, but are defined to be a rigid connection wherein the shift fork <b>650</b> cannot move relative to the shift rod <b>652</b>. The interlock hub <b>654</b> mounts to the shift rod <b>652</b> and is secured so that the hub <b>654</b> is prevented from moving longitudinally along shift rod <b>652</b>. The interlock hub <b>654</b> includes a groove <b>656</b> that is wider than the thickness of interlock bar <b>660</b>. A spring assembly <b>664</b> is provided to bias the interlock bar <b>660</b> towards the interlock hub <b>654</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In operation, when the shift fork <b>650</b> is located in a neutral position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11</figref><i>a</i>, the interlock bar <b>660</b> is located in one of two positions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the interlock bar <b>660</b> is not engaged with the groove <b>656</b> of interlock hub <b>654</b>; and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, the interlock bar <b>660</b> is engaged with the groove <b>656</b> of interlock hub <b>654</b>. The configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> corresponds to the position of the cross-drive shaft <b>604</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> where a cam surface <b>662</b> of the interlock bar <b>660</b> is in contact with the offset section <b>628</b> of the cross-shaft <b>604</b>. When the cam surface <b>662</b> is not in contact with the offset section <b>628</b>, then the interlock bar <b>660</b> will be in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>. In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, the shift fork <b>650</b> is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this manner, the position of the coupler <b>614</b> cannot move from the neutral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11</figref><i>a</i>) to either of the engaged positions corresponding to the straight or deviated drilling modes unless the cross-drive shaft <b>604</b> is at a specific position, i.e., the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> where the offset section <b>628</b> of cross-drive shaft <b>604</b> is in contact with the cam surface <b>662</b> of interlock bar <b>660</b>. This shifting mechanism <b>680</b> allows the operator to control the drilling operation by positioning the drill head <b>100</b>-<b>400</b> in a desired deviation direction while in the straight drilling mode; and with the coupler <b>614</b> in the first position, stopping the rotation of the drill head; and then shifting the coupler <b>614</b> towards the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The coupler <b>614</b> will not move to the second position if the cross-shaft <b>604</b> is not located at the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Thus, the operator will then rotate the cross-shaft <b>604</b> until properly positioned (as shown illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) such that the coupler <b>614</b> is able to shift to the second position. The shifting action could be completed via a preloaded spring, so that the actual shifting action will happen automatically. This configuration is thus capable of providing a mechanical system that is easy to operate, and that provides consistent and reliable operation.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref> disclose alternative mechanical drive systems including electro-hydraulic components that provide the ability to vary the oscillating motion, not possible with the purely mechanical system. One reason that this capability is desirable is that it provides an ability to adjust the oscillation pattern of an output shaft of the gearbox to compensate for the angular deflection of the drill string. Angular deflection can result from the torque required to rotate the drill bit, and can affect the rotation of the drill head and drill bit. For instance, when starting a hole, the drill string is short, and the angular deflection will be negligible; accordingly all of, or a majority of, the oscillating motion of the output shaft of the gearbox will be transferred to the drill head.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As the bored hole length increases, the length of the drill string increases, and the angular deflection (i.e. the rotational or angular lag in oscillating motion) can become significant. In particular, when the drill string <b>20</b> is a significant length, there may be an angular deflection or lag of 60 degrees, for example. In order to compensate for the lag and rotate the drill head 60 degrees from 12:00 to 2:00, the output shaft of the gearbox would need to rotate 120 degrees from 12:00 to 4:00.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the instance of a lengthy drill string, the oscillating motion of the output shaft of the gearbox may not be transferred directly to the drill head. As the length of the drill string increases, the potential for angular deflection, or wind-up, increase. The angular deflection can be estimated using a mathematical model:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">The oscillation of the output shaft of the gearbox required to provide a repeatable oscillation of the drill head will be a function of the torque required to rotate the drill bit and the length of the drill string. The oscillation pattern of the output shaft would thus preferably be controlled to compensate for the angular deflection, with the amount of rotation in the forward direction increasing to compensate for the drill string angular deflection or wind-up.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">It is likely that this increased oscillating motion will be in one direction of rotation, and not the other. For instance, in the example from above, where the desired oscillation of the drill head is between 10:00 and 2:00, centered on 12:00, and there is angular deflection of 60 degrees when rotating in the first, forward direction, the output shaft of the gearbox will need to rotate from 12:00 to 4:00 in a forward direction to force the drill head to rotate from 12:00 to 2:00.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">To complete the oscillation motion, the forward rotation will be followed by travel of the drill head from 2:00 to 10:00 in a reverse direction. During the reverse travel, the one-way clutch will function to allow the drill head to rotate while the drill bit remains stationary. Thus, there will be minimal torque load in the drill string, and thus minimal angular deflection of the drill string during the reverse rotation. Thus, the output shaft of the gearbox will need to move from 4:00, back to 2:00, in reverse, to unwind the drill string, before the drill head will begin to rotate backwards. The output shaft will then need to continue to rotate, further in reverse, from 2:00 and back to 10:00. During this rotation, the drill string will not be subjected to any significant torque, and angular deflection will be negligible. The drill head moves in conjunction with the output shaft of the gearbox from 10:00 back to 2:00. Thus, the output shaft of the gearbox will oscillate 180 degrees between 10:00 and 4:00, traveling through 12:00 in order to oscillate the drill head through 120 degrees between 10:00 and 2:00.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">A preferred method of operation involves initiating the deviated drilling mode by oscillating the output shaft of the gearbox through the desired steering arc, in an initial oscillation pattern, while assessing information and monitoring data to allow an estimate of the amount of drill string wind-up, in order to implement an adjusted oscillation pattern. The length of the drill string is a factor that may be used in estimating drill string wind-up, as shown in the mathematical model above (the drill string wind-up is mathematically directly proportional to the length L).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, one arrangement for operating a drilling rig <b>10</b> in accord with the principle disclosed is schematically represented. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the length of the drill string is determined from a separate control system or controller <b>802</b> that provides a signal <b>818</b> corresponding to drill string length. One example of such a system is described in co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,787, incorporated herein by reference. In an alternative embodiment, the signal <b>818</b> can be provided by a manual input from the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">In order to utilize the mathematical model, torque T necessary to rotate the drill string must also be determined. Torque T can be measured during forward rotation of the drill string, during the initial oscillation pattern. There are many possible ways to measure torque, including the use of a transducer mounted to the output shaft of the gearbox. An alternative method would be to measure the hydraulic pressure provided to the hydraulic motors <b>602</b>, which will be proportional to the torque T. A pressure transducer <b>822</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for providing an input signal <b>816</b> corresponding to the hydraulic pressure required to rotate a drive shaft or output shaft <b>710</b> in a forward direction. Combining these two factors, T and L, allows the controller <b>802</b> to estimate drill string wind-up and compensate in order to initiate an adjusted oscillation pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">A second method utilizes data analysis of the torque applied to the drill string as related to the angular position, specifically looking at the torque curve during reverse rotation as a compensating factor. The relationship between torque T and rotation &#x3b2; of the output shaft <b>710</b> during initiation of a deviated drilling mode is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>a</i>. The initial oscillation pattern will be defined by oscillating the output shaft through the steering arc defined by +/&#x2212;&#x3b2;1. During the initial oscillation pattern, the torque T in the drill string is a linear function of the forward rotation &#x3b2; of the output shaft of the gearbox until the torque required to rotate the drill head is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">The situation represented by the line from point <b>700</b> to point <b>702</b>, illustrates a condition wherein the drill string length L and the torque T required to rotate the drill bit are sufficient to allow angular deflection &#x3b8; equal to &#x3b2;1 (wherein the drill bit is not rotated). After the forward rotation of &#x3b2;1 degrees, the output shaft stops and reverses, represented by the line from <b>702</b> to <b>704</b>. Wind-up of the drill string generates a residual torque that is applied to the output shaft of the gearbox. The residual torque measured at the output shaft will not be equal to zero until the output shaft is rotated back approximately &#x3b2;1 degrees, which in this case will position the output shaft near its original home position.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">As the initial oscillation pattern continues, and the output shaft <b>710</b> of the gearbox continues to rotate in a reverse direction to &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 (from point <b>706</b> to point <b>708</b>), the rotational movement of the drill string and drill head &#xd8; will require minimal reverse torque. If the drill head being used is identical to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the offset side <b>46</b> of the offset adaptor <b>40</b> will rotate with the drill string <b>20</b>, while the drill bit <b>130</b> remains fixed due to operation of the one-way clutch <b>115</b>. Thus, the rotation of the drill head &#xd8; will be equal to &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 degrees, rotated in the reverse direction from the center position.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">As the initial oscillation pattern continues, the output shaft <b>710</b> of the gearbox is stopped and forward rotation begins at point <b>708</b>. As the output shaft rotates forward from &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 to 0, the drill string will again wind-up and the line from <b>708</b> to <b>710</b> will be parallel to the line from <b>700</b> to <b>702</b>. In this case, the torque T<b>1</b> is sufficient to rotate the drill head, and thus the drill head and drill string will rotate together as the output shaft rotates from 0 to +&#x3b2;1 degrees; resulting in drill head rotation &#xd8; equal to &#x3b2;1 (wherein the drill head will be back to its initial position). Thus, if this oscillation pattern of the output shaft were to continue with the output shaft <b>710</b> rotating through +/&#x2212;&#x3b2;1 degrees, the drill head rotation &#xd8; will be between 0 and &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0101">It is possible to evaluate the data of the initial oscillation pattern to develop an appropriate compensation angle &#x3a9;, by determining an amount of reverse rotation corresponding to the furthest forward rotation position of the output shaft to the position of the output shaft where the residual torque in the drill string is relieved, and the torque on the drill string is zero. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>b</i>, where the compensation angle &#x3a9; is determined when the drill string <b>20</b> reverses from point <b>702</b> to point <b>704</b> during the initial oscillation pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">An adjusted oscillation pattern is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>c</i>. The forward rotation begins at point <b>708</b>, wherein the drill head has been rotated &#x2212;&#xd8; degrees. The drill string will wind-up and the drill head will not rotate until sufficient torque is generated at point <b>710</b>. The output shaft <b>710</b> of the gearbox will continue to rotate in a forward direction to point <b>712</b>, identical to the initial oscillation pattern, which will result in drill head rotation of +&#xd8; back to its initial position, and will continue with a compensation, rotating to &#x3b2;2, wherein &#x3b2;2=&#x3b2;1+&#x3a9;1.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">The drill head will then rotate an additional +&#xd8; degrees. As this oscillation pattern continues, the output shaft will rotate through +&#x3b2;2 to &#x2212;&#x3b2;1, which will result in the drill head rotation through +/&#x2212;&#xd8; degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">A number of initial oscillation cycles, equivalent to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>a</i>, may be necessary to verify the accuracy of the compensation angle &#x3a9;. The controller will modify the oscillation pattern of the output shaft of the gearbox to initiate the adjusted oscillation pattern, and will continue to monitor the accuracy of the compensation angle &#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref> (<i>a</i>) through (<i>d</i>) illustrate an example where the compensation angle will become more accurate as compensation is implemented. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> (<i>a</i>) illustrates an example where the drill string is more flexible than the drill string illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(</figref><i>a</i>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> (<i>a</i>) the initial oscillation pattern would start at point <b>800</b> wherein the output shaft would rotate to +&#x3b2;1 generating a first amount of torque at point <b>802</b>. The output shaft would then reverse and rotate to &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 wherein the torque will first drop to zero at point <b>804</b>, and will then drop to a minimal reverse torque as the drill string and offset adaptor rotate in reverse with the drill string to point <b>806</b>. As the initial oscillation pattern continues, the output shaft <b>710</b> of the gearbox is stopped and forward rotation begins at point <b>806</b>. As the output shaft rotates forward from &#x2212;&#x3b2;1 to 0, the drill string will again wind-up and the line from <b>806</b> to <b>808</b> will be parallel to the line from <b>800</b> to <b>802</b>. The initial oscillation pattern will continue with rotation of the output shaft from +/&#x2212;&#x3b2;3 degrees. In this case the drill head would never rotate, and the progress of the drilling would stop.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>b </i>illustrates an initial single cycle of an initial oscillation pattern wherein a first compensation angle &#x3a9;1 is determined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>c </i>illustrates the next subsequent oscillation cycle wherein the output shaft is rotated to &#x3b2;2=&#x3b2;1+&#x3a9;1. In this example, the first compensation angle is not sufficient, and the subsequent compensation angle &#x3a9;2 is measured during this cycle. Since &#x3a9;2 is greater than &#x3a9;1, the next subsequent oscillation pattern, illustrated as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>d</i>, utilizes the latest compensation angle and &#x3b2;3=&#x3b2;1+&#x3a9;2. This method can include a technique of dynamically modifying the compensation angle to allow the system to automatically adjust for variations in the wind-up of the drill string that can be caused by variations in the length of the drill string and the torque required to rotate the drill bit.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0107">A third alternative method would be to monitor a clock position signal <b>814</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, to adjust the oscillation pattern. The clock position signal <b>814</b> could be generated using one of a number of systems; for example, from raw data will be generated by the sonde or transmitter <b>32</b> located in the sonde housing <b>30</b> of the drill head <b>100</b>-<b>400</b>. The sonde <b>32</b> includes an electronic device that measures the clock position or rotational orientation, and generates raw clock position data. The sonde further includes data processing capability to manipulate the raw clock position data to generate data in a number of different configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">A first, common, configuration of data is generated by an arrangement including a wireless communication link <b>782</b> and a receiver <b>780</b> located above ground. In this arrangement, the sonde <b>32</b> converts the raw clock position data into a digital signal superimposed on an electromagnetic signal <b>792</b> that is transmitted to the above ground receiver <b>780</b>. The above ground receiver then transmits an associated signal <b>783</b> to a remote unit <b>781</b> mounted on the drilling rig <b>10</b>, The associated signal <b>783</b> includes filtered clock position data. The filtered clock position data is a representation of the raw clock position data. The data manipulation at the sonde <b>32</b>, necessary to transmit the signal using the wireless transmission links <b>782</b>, is effectively a type of filter.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0109">In a second configuration the wireless communication links <b>782</b> and <b>783</b> are replaced with a wireline, wherein there is a physical communication link passing through the drill string <b>20</b> between the sonde <b>32</b> and the remote unit <b>781</b> located on the drilling rig <b>10</b>. This configuration will allow transmission of a different signal; the raw clock position data will not need to be filtered to the same level as with the wireless communication of the first configuration, because the wireline has capacity to transmit data at a higher rate of transmission, thus requiring less filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0110">In either case, the remote unit <b>781</b> is capable of generating the clock position signal <b>814</b> that is an indication of the measured oscillation of the drill head <b>100</b>-<b>400</b>. In the first configuration, the signal <b>782</b> is transmitted at a frequency, which the wireless communication links <b>782</b> and <b>783</b> are capable of supporting. This frequency may be less than the frequency of the actual oscillations of the drill head, when the drill head is oscillating at a full speed. Thus, as the drill head begins to oscillate, the compensation for drill string wind-up may lag by a significant time, 1 to 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0111">In particular, the controller <b>802</b> will initiate the desired oscillation upon receiving a signal <b>810</b> from a switch <b>824</b>. The switch <b>824</b> is typically located at the operator station, and is manually actuated by the operator when deviated drilling is desired. The signal <b>810</b> includes an initial oscillation pattern of the output shaft <b>710</b>. The initial oscillation pattern will be controlled via a feedback signal <b>812</b> from a rotation sensor <b>820</b>, in order to oscillate the shaft <b>710</b> and drill string <b>20</b>, through the desired angle. If there is no drill string wind-up, the drill head will be rotated through the same oscillation. As the shaft <b>710</b> is oscillated with this initial oscillation pattern, the clock position signal <b>814</b> will be monitored to determine whether the oscillation at the shaft <b>710</b> is transferred through the drill string <b>20</b>. After an initial period of operation, the oscillation of the shaft <b>710</b> will be modified to an adjusted oscillation pattern, as necessary to transmit the desired oscillation to the sonde <b>32</b> at the drill head <b>100</b>-<b>400</b>. The initial oscillation pattern may be at a lower frequency, allowing determination of an appropriate adjustment, while the adjusted oscillation pattern may be at a higher frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0112">An alternative system may include data manipulation at the sonde <b>32</b>, wherein the raw clock position data could be monitored, and the sonde could produce a signal to communicate the range of oscillation of the drill head. This system would also require some lag time between an initial oscillation pattern, and an adjusted oscillation pattern, as it will take some time for the sonde to recognize the oscillations, in order to detect that a deviated mode of boring has been initiated, and to monitor several oscillations in order to produce the range of oscillation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate alternative systems that would provide variable oscillation for deviated drilling. In these Figures, a hydraulic pump <b>750</b> provides hydraulic power to the hydraulic motors <b>602</b> mounted to a gearbox <b>760</b>, in a manner that the speed and direction of rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b> is controlled by a first control lever <b>825</b> that activates a cable <b>846</b> that positions a second control lever <b>844</b>. In both arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the controller <b>802</b> receives the feedback signal <b>812</b> from the rotation sensor <b>820</b>. The feedback signal <b>812</b> from the rotation sensor <b>820</b> represents the direction and amount of rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0114">To initiate deviated drilling in the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the operator first releases the manual control lever <b>825</b>, which is used to control rotation during straight drilling, after the drill head is positioned in the desired steering direction. The operator then activates the deviated drilling switch <b>824</b>. The signal <b>810</b> will indicate to the controller <b>802</b> that the deviated drilling mode should be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0115">The controller <b>802</b> operates to provide control signals necessary to oscillate the output shaft <b>710</b> in a manner to attempt to cause the drill head to oscillate about the rotational position corresponding to its position at time the deviated drilling switch <b>824</b> is initially depressed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, operation is controlled by providing an electrical signal <b>830</b> to energize an electrical motor <b>840</b> that powers an eccentric <b>842</b>. The eccentric <b>842</b> generates mechanical movement of the second control lever <b>844</b>. The second control lever <b>844</b> provides a mechanical signal to the hydraulic pump <b>750</b>, which is also activated by cable <b>846</b> and control lever <b>825</b> during straight drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">The controller <b>802</b> energizes the electric motor <b>840</b> in a first direction, to cause the output shaft <b>710</b> to rotate in the first, forward direction. During this rotation, the controller <b>802</b> will monitor the rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b> via the feedback signal <b>812</b>. When the desired amount of rotation has been achieved, the controller <b>802</b> will modify the electrical signal <b>830</b> and cause the electric motor <b>840</b> to rotate in the opposite direction. This will in turn cause the eccentric <b>842</b> to move the control lever <b>844</b> into the opposite position, whereby the hydraulic pump <b>750</b> will reverse the direction of rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b>. The controller <b>802</b> will continue to monitor the feedback signal <b>812</b> to control the amount of reverse rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b>. In this manner, the controller <b>802</b> is able to control the oscillation of the output shaft of the gearbox, in a variable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">Based on any combination of the previously described inputs, the controller <b>802</b> is capable of modifying the electric signal <b>830</b> to control the electric motor <b>840</b> to achieve the desired oscillation of the drill head during deviated drilling, by implementation of the adjusted oscillation pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an alternative method of controlling the hydraulic system. Rather than utilizing the electrical motor <b>840</b> to mechanically manipulate the control lever <b>844</b> of the previous arrangement, this arrangement utilizes two control signals <b>832</b> and <b>834</b> to control poppet valves <b>752</b> and <b>754</b>. When energized, the poppet valves direct hydraulic pressure from a secondary pump <b>756</b> to the main hydraulic pump <b>750</b> where the pressure hydraulically activates an internal servo circuit of the pump <b>750</b> causing the pump <b>750</b> to generate rotation of the output shaft in a desired direction, independent of a mechanical control system, such as the motor <b>840</b>, eccentric <b>842</b> and lever <b>844</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The other aspects of operation are identical to that described earlier for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates yet another alternative embodiment of a hydraulic system wherein the hydraulic pump <b>750</b> is controlled by an electric signal <b>836</b>. In this embodiment, a control lever <b>826</b> generates a signal <b>828</b> that is an input to the controller <b>802</b>. In this configuration, the controller <b>802</b> provides the electric signal <b>836</b> to the hydraulic pump <b>750</b> to control the flow direction and flow rate in both drilling modes, i.e., the straight drilling mode and deviated drilling mode. All other functions, involving the initiation and control of oscillation are similar to that previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an additional alternative embodiment wherein the hydraulic pump <b>750</b> is controlled exclusively by the first control lever <b>825</b> and the cable <b>826</b>. The first control lever <b>825</b> can include, for example, a mechanical joystick. To initiate oscillation, the operator rotates the drill string <b>20</b> to a desired position in which to initiate a steering correction. Activation of the switch <b>824</b> indicates to the controller <b>802</b> that the position, as measured by the rotation sensor and the feedback signal <b>812</b> is the desired steering position. The initial oscillation pattern will be initiated by leaving a valve <b>758</b> in a de-energized position until shaft <b>710</b> has rotated through the desired angle of rotation. When the output shaft <b>710</b> reaches the desired angle of rotation, the valve <b>758</b> shifts to an energized position (via a solenoid, not shown) to reverse the flow of hydraulic fluid, and reverse the direction of rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b>. It will be held in this position until the output shaft rotates through the necessary angle of rotation in the opposite direction where the valve <b>758</b> will shift to the de-energized position. In the de-energized position, the valve returns to its initial position and flow and rotation reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0120">The sequence of energizing and de-energizing the solenoid of the valve <b>758</b> produces the oscillation pattern. The actual speed of rotation of the output shaft <b>710</b> and drill string <b>20</b> will be controlled by the mechanical position of the joystick <b>825</b>. Thus, the operator will have direct control of the speed of rotation, while the electrical system will have control of the direction of rotation as necessary to produce an initial oscillation pattern followed by an adjusted oscillation pattern as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0121">The embodiments of the present disclosure may be used in applications other than horizontal boring. For example, in many vertical drilling applications, directional drilling techniques are used. The details disclosed in the above teachings are recognized to be applicable to such vertical drilling applications.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0122">In addition, many other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
