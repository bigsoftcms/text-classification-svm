<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention relates to a retractable rod and a tent made from the rod. The retractable rod comprises a multitude of rigid skeleton joints having two axial end surfaces and side surfaces. The joints are connected through the convex-concave connection by two flexible ropes passing through the holes of the joints to form a rod. There is a storage compartment locating at one end of the rod which winds and stores the rod therein. The storage compartment comprises a shaft, a rod storage sleeve which is in an intermittent drive mode fixed to the shaft; one end of the two flexible ropes passes through the rod storage sleeve and is fixed to the shaft. The rod storage sleeve is supported and rotates between two rope-protecting boards. A tension part locates at the other end of the rod and the other end of the two flexible ropes is fixed to the tension part. The advantage of the invention is that the tent made from the retractable rod occupies a small storage space.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation-In-Part of international application PCT/CN2007/000238, filed Jan. 23, 2007, which claims priority from Chinese patent applications 200610033289.2 filed on Jan. 24, 2006 and 200610036648.X filed on Jul. 19, 2006. These two applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a retractable rod and a tent made thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some temporary structures such as advertising posters and tents can be taken apart and reassembled. Their frames are usually made of rods and joints. Advertising posters or tent tarpaulins are attached to the frame by gripping or other ways. Such structures occupy a reduced space after being disassembled. However, the rods require a certain length, and thus the space reduction in these structures after being disassembled is not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Chinese patent No. CN1027657C discloses a backbone type tent frame which consists of several plastic or metal tubes. These tubes are connected with a wire, forming an arc, triangle, or other polygonal shape. When the wire is loosened the tubes can be folded up. Using such rods, the frame to support a tent can be formed. The frame or tent of such a design can further reduce the volume. However, its use is still complicated by multiple steps in operation. Particularly, when the rods are relatively long, they are easily disorganized after being folded up, causing inconvenience for reassembling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The main object of the invention is to provide rods which are easily retractable and restored in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another objective of the invention is to use such retractable rods to make a tent.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To recognize these objectives, the retractable rod of the invention comprises a multitude of rigid skeleton joints with two axial ends and sides. One end of the joint is a convex shape and the other end is a concave shape. The convex of one joint connects with the concave of an adjacent joint. Each joint has two axial through holes and all joints are connected in series along the through holes by two flexible ropes. In addition, there is a storage compartment which is located at an end of the retractable rod to wind the retractable rod and store wherein. The storage compartment has a shaft. A rod storage sleeve is linked by an intermittent driving mode to an end of the shaft. One end of the ropes passes through the rod storage sleeve and ties to the shaft. The rod storage sleeve rotationally supports two rope-protecting boards. A tension part is provided at another end of the rod; another end of the two ropes is fixed on the tension part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the invention is to design the intermittent driving mode that links the shaft and the rod storage sleeve as a pair of gears. By this way, when the shaft rotates clockwise, it drives the rod storage sleeve; when the shaft rotates counterclockwise, it gives 360&#xb0; intermittence. When the gears rotate in opposite directions, the shaft drives the rod storage sleeve to rotate counterclockwise, vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment is to design the tension part to have a support foot and an elastic structure linked between the ends of the ropes and the support foot. When the rope is stretched, the elastic structure is tensed, and the rod becomes rigid. When the rope is relaxed, the rope under the resilience of the elastic structure relaxes the restriction on the joints so that they can be folded up and conveniently stored.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To use the rigid rod in a curved shape, the surfaces of the joints can be designed to have a certain angle and make the axes of the convex and concave vertical over the surface. This forms curvatures in some joints. The degree of the angle and the number of the curved joints can be determined by the desired radian of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another retractable rod of the invention comprises rigid joints that have two axial end surfaces and sides. One axial end of each joint has a convex and the other axial end has a concave which matches with the convex. Each joint has two or more axial through holes. All joints are organized by convex-concave manner and connected by two or more ropes which pass the through holes to form a rod. In addition, there is a storage compartment located at one end of the retractable rod to wind and store the retractable rod therein. The storage compartment comprises a shaft, a rod storage sleeve which is set outside the shaft and can rotate relative to the shaft, and two or more ropes, one end of which passes through the rod storage sleeve and fixes to the shaft. The storage sleeve can rotate and support between two rope-protecting boards.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One embodiment is that between the convex and concave of two adjacent joints are set an elastic part which can separate the convex and concave.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More particularly, the elastic part is a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To use the rigid rod in a curved shape, the surfaces of the joints can be designed to have a certain angle and make the axes of the convex and concave vertical over the surface. This forms curvatures in some joints. The degree of the angle and the number of the curved joints can be determined by the desired radian of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The tent made from the retractable rods of the invention comprises a tarpaulin which can form the space of the tent and three and more retractable rods which form the support of the tent. The tarpaulin is attached to the rods and can be retracted together with the rods. Thus, when the rods are in a rigid state, the tarpaulin opens to form a tent; when the rods are in a relaxed state, the tarpaulin retracts with the rods.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An embodiment is to design a power input shaft to receive force; the power input shaft, through a transmission mechanism, drives the shafts of all retractable rods to rotate simultaneously. Thus, rotating the power input shaft can conveniently open or retract the tent.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More particularly, the power input shaft is controlled by an electrical motor which opens or retracts the tent. Also, the transmission mechanism is a gear system. One of the gears has a locking mechanism which can stop all other gears. Thus, when the rods retract to a position or open to a position to make the rods rigid, the entire system is locked to avoid any undesired retraction or opening of the tent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above locking mechanism comprises a magnetic locking bar and locking teeth surrounding a gear shaft. The locking bar and locking teeth are controlled by magnet. When the bar and the teeth are meshed, the entire system is locked. When the bar and the teeth are separated, the transmission system, driven by the motor, opens or retracts the tent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the tent can have a control panel which is equipped with flare and remote control receiver. This make more convenient to operate the tent and use it in night.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tent made from another type of retractable rods of the invention comprises a tarpaulin which can form a space of the tent and three or more retractable rods which form the support of the tent. The tarpaulin is attached to the rods and can be retracted together with the rods. Thus, when the rods are in the rigid state, the tarpaulin opens to form a tent; when the rods are in the relaxed state, the tarpaulin retracts with the rods.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment is to design a power input shaft driven by motor; the power input shaft is linked through a transmission mechanism to the rod storage sleeves; each shaft is driven by a separate motor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">More particularly, each shaft is set up with a gear and a locking mechanism that can lock the gear.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The locking mechanism comprises a magnetic locking bar; the locking bar and the locking teeth of the gear are controlled by magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also, the tent is set up with a control panel which is equipped with a flare and a remote control receiver.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1 of Retractable Rod</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, retractable rod <b>100</b> is made of a multitude of rigid skeleton joints <b>110</b>. The concave and convex surfaces of the joints are connected along the through holes by two flexible ropes <b>130</b>. The two ropes can form a circle and become one rope <b>130</b>. The storage compartment comprises a shaft <b>101</b> which is in an intermittent driving mode and fixed onto a rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and a pair of rope-protecting boards <b>104</b>. Two rope-protecting boards form a storage space <b>105</b>. In this embodiment, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> is linked to the rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> through bearing <b>102</b>. Ropes <b>130</b> pass through rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and are then fixed to shaft <b>101</b>. The other end of ropes <b>130</b> is fixed to a tension part. The tension part comprises a support leg and a spring <b>145</b>. Alternatively, the spring <b>145</b> can be replaced by a rubber bend. The support leg comprises rigid tube <b>141</b>, caulking <b>146</b>, foot <b>143</b> and pin <b>142</b>; pin <b>142</b> is used to link foot <b>143</b>, tube <b>141</b> and caulking <b>146</b>; spring <b>145</b> is linked to rope <b>130</b> through pin <b>144</b>. Soft tube <b>120</b> is able to slide along the outside of rigid joints <b>110</b>, an end of which is fixing to pin <b>142</b> and the other end is left free.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and shaft <b>101</b> are linked by gears <b>1012</b> and <b>1032</b>. The rod showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is in its released state; at the same time, the spring is in relaxing state.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2 of Retractable Rod</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, retractable rod <b>100</b> comprises a multitude of rigid skeleton joints which are concave-convex connected in series through rope <b>130</b>; rope <b>130</b> forms a circle. Storage compartment comprise shaft <b>101</b> which can revolve around rope-protecting boards <b>104</b>, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> which can rotate around shaft <b>101</b>, and storage space <b>105</b> formed by rope-protecting boards <b>104</b>. In this embodiment, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> is linked to rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> in a revolving mode. One end of ropes <b>130</b> passes through rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and fixes to shaft <b>101</b>. The other end of ropes <b>130</b> is fixed to the other end of the retractable rod. Between the canvas and convex of two adjacent skeleton joints, there is a spring <b>106</b>. The retractable rod shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is in a rigid state, i.e., rope <b>130</b> is in a tension state and spring <b>106</b> is in a pressured state. In addition, this embodiment differs from embodiment 1 in that in this embodiment, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and shaft <b>101</b> are driven independently, i.e., one force drives rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> to rotate and control the rod in and out, and another force drives the shaft <b>101</b> to rotate to pull or release the rope.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> and shaft <b>101</b> rotate against rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> driven by independent forces. The rod shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is in a relaxing state where spring <b>106</b> and the rope both are in a relaxing state; adjacent skeleton joints under the resilience of spring <b>106</b> release the convex-concave connection and thus the joints can be folded up.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this figure shows rigid joint <b>110</b>, an enlarged sectional view of end surface <b>111</b>. Through this end surface, one can see a pair of holes <b>116</b>, a concave <b>114</b>, and a connecting trough <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rigid joint is formed by end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> and side surfaces <b>113</b>. One end surface has a concave <b>114</b> and the other end surface has a convex <b>115</b>; convex <b>115</b> and concave <b>114</b> match with each other; adjacent joints are thus connected each other through the convex and concave shapes. To set up the rod straight, the end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of each joint are set parallel to each other; to set up the rod curvedly, in the place of curvature, end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> can be design to have an angel; this makes convex <b>115</b> vertical to end surface <b>112</b>, and makes concave <b>114</b> vertical to end surface <b>111</b>. In order to prevent the curved joints from being connected in an opposite way, the adjacent joints are not only connected in the convex-concave connection but also set up to have the same direction as connecting trough <b>117</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, two holes <b>116</b> of the joints are set parallel to the flank of convex <b>115</b> and concave <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, these figures show the structure of another embodiment of the rigid joints. The markings of these figures are the same as those in the above embodiments. The difference is that in this embodiment, two holes <b>116</b> are set parallel and placed inside convex <b>115</b> and concave <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, these figures show an additional embodiment of the structure of the rigid joints. The markings of these figures are the same as those in the above embodiments. The unique feature of this embodiment is that each of end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of the joints has a convex <b>115</b> and a concave <b>114</b> and two holes <b>116</b> pass parallel through convex <b>115</b> and concave <b>114</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, these figures show a still additional embodiment of the structure of the rigid joints. The markings of these figures are the same as those in the above embodiments. The unique feature of this embodiment is that each of end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of the joints has two convexes <b>115</b> or two concaves <b>114</b> and two holes <b>116</b> pass parallel through one convex <b>115</b> and one concave <b>114</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, these figures show still another embodiment of the structure of the rigid joints. The markings of these figures are the same as those in the above embodiments. The unique feature of this embodiment is that each of end surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of the joints has three convexes <b>115</b> or concaves <b>114</b> and three holes <b>116</b> that pass through parallel one convex <b>115</b> and one concave <b>114</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">There are still more possible embodiments of the retractable rod of the invention. For instance, there can be four holes <b>116</b>, five holes <b>116</b>, or even more holes <b>116</b>, and there can be provided with the same number of flexible ropes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The following description explains the working mechanism of embodiment 1. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, when shaft <b>101</b> rotates clockwise by following the arrow direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, gear <b>1012</b> drives gear <b>1032</b> to rotate, and gear <b>1032</b> then drives rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> to rotate. This allows soft tube <b>120</b> and inside rigid joints <b>110</b> through the convex-concave connection enter into between two rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> until the end surface of rigid tube <b>141</b> is about to enter; the spring is tensed; and the retraction process is finished. The releasing process of the rod is as follows. In the above retracted state, when shaft <b>101</b> rotates counterclockwise by following the arrow direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an intermittent transmission occurs. First, gear <b>1012</b> departs from gear <b>1032</b>, and the gear idles. That is, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> does not rotate. The flexible rope, under the resilience of spring <b>145</b>, slides along the joints through the holes. When shaft <b>101</b> rotates about 360&#xb0;, gear <b>1012</b> drives gear <b>1032</b> and gear <b>1032</b> drives rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> to rotate counterclockwise. At this time, soft tube <b>120</b> is released from the rope-protecting boards until it reaches the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The shaft continues rotating counterclockwise, which pulls the flexible rope until the top end <b>1451</b> of spring <b>145</b> reaches the joint and pushes the convex and concave of the joints tightly against each other. This forms a rigid rod.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The following description explains the working mechanism of embodiment 2. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, when shaft <b>101</b> and rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> are driven by each individual force, they rotate starting from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> clockwise by following the arrow indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>; soft tube <b>120</b> and inside rigid joints <b>110</b> enter into between two rope-protecting boards <b>104</b>, and thus the retraction process is complete. The releasing process of the rod is as follows. In the above retracted state, when shaft <b>101</b> and rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> are driven by each individual force, first, they rotate to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> counterclockwise, then, rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> stop rotating, shaft <b>101</b> continues rotating counterclockwise, which pulls the flexible rope, this forms a rigid rod shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 1 of Tents</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the tent of the invention is made by a rigid frame comprising three or more of the retractable rods. This embodiment uses four retractable rods <b>100</b>; storage compartment is in storage box <b>200</b>; tarpaulin <b>300</b> is linked by rings <b>310</b> to the rods <b>100</b>. Tarpaulin is equipped with a zipper <b>302</b> to open or close door <b>301</b> to let people in or out.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, after the tent is retracted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, tarpaulin <b>300</b> is folded up inside rigid tube <b>141</b>; as the tent is retracted, it takes a smaller space to store than the tents known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The following describes the structure of storage box <b>200</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, storage box <b>200</b> comprises chassis <b>203</b>, covering <b>201</b>, and control panel <b>204</b>. The control panel is provided with a flare, a remote control receiver, and a control push-button, etc. In addition, storage box <b>200</b> has holes <b>202</b> for the four rods.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, removing cover <b>201</b>, one can see the top cover <b>205</b> and bottom cover <b>206</b> which are used to support the gear system; one can also see the battery <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, removing top cover <b>205</b>, one can see the gear system; the gear system comprises drive gear <b>211</b> which is linked to the power input shaft, idle gears <b>212</b> and <b>215</b>, and gears <b>213</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, each retractable rod has two rope-protecting boards <b>104</b>, which is fixed on storage box <b>200</b>. To reduce cost, the bearing between the rod storage sleeve and rope-protecting boards can be designed as friction-based hole-cover type rather than ball gears. The width of storage space <b>105</b> depends on the length of the rod. The storage space <b>105</b> can be designed to store a number of rope circles per level. The power input shaft for drive gear <b>211</b> is linked with the power output shaft of motor <b>230</b>; idle gear <b>215</b> is provided with a locking device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, idle gear <b>215</b> meshes with gear <b>216</b>; gear <b>216</b> meshes with gear <b>217</b>. Gear <b>217</b> and bevel gear <b>218</b> form twin gear. Gear <b>218</b> meshes with another bevel gear <b>219</b> which is fixed on shaft <b>101</b>. Thus, the power transmission of the retractable rod is complete. Other three retractable rods can be designed in the same way so that all four retractable rods will function simultaneously. Magnet <b>221</b> has a sheet-shaped locking bar <b>222</b>. The axis core of idle gear <b>215</b> has a vertical socket <b>2151</b> for locking bar <b>222</b> to insert. Magnet <b>221</b> and motor <b>230</b> receive or loss power simultaneously. When power is supplied, magnet attracts down locking bar <b>222</b>, the locker is withdrawn; when power is lost, the resilience of the spring <b>2211</b> pushes locking bar <b>222</b> to insert in socket <b>2151</b>; the system is thus locked.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 2 of Tents</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This embodiment differs from the above embodiment in the inner structure of storage box <b>200</b> which is described as follows.</p>

Rod storage sleeve <b>103</b> extends to the end of rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is equipped with gear <b>314</b>; two gears <b>314</b> mesh with worm bearing adjuster <b>315</b>. Thus, motor <b>320</b> drives the four retractable rods and rod storage sleeves <b>103</b> to rotate simultaneously. Shafts <b>101</b> of the four retractable rods extend outside the end of rope-protecting boards <b>104</b> which is equipped with gears <b>316</b>. Each gear <b>316</b> is fixed to the power output axis of motor <b>330</b>. Thus, each shaft <b>101</b> is provided with power. The locking device comprises magnet <b>341</b> and locking bar <b>342</b>. Driven by magnet <b>341</b>, locking bar <b>342</b> insert into or pull out of the space between the teeth of gear <b>316</b> to lock or unlock the shafts. The width of storage space <b>105</b> depends on the length of the rod. The storage space <b>105</b> can be designed to store a number of rope circles per level.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The invention uses a flexible rope to connect rigid skeleton joints to form a rod. When the rope is stretched, the convex of each skeleton joint tightly pushes against the concave of the adjacent skeleton joint to form a rigid rod. When the rope is relaxed, the convex-concave connection loosens; adjacent joints can move relative to each other to form angles; the rod thus becomes flexible and can be folded up or coiled. The objective of the invention is that the operation for exchange between the flexible state and the rigid state of the rod is simple and rod in flexible state can be orderly organized and stored. Thus, a storage compartment is set at one end of the rod. The storage compartment comprises a rod storage sleeve driven by a shaft and two flexible ropes, one end of which passes through the rod storage sleeve and is then fixed to the shaft. The rod storage sleeve is supported and rotates between the rope-protecting boards. When the shaft drives the rod storage sleeve to rotate, the rod can coil around the rod storage sleeve and be stored between the rope-protecting boards. At the other end of the shaft, there is a tension part. On one side, this allows the relaxed rod to be coiled and stored inside the rod storage sleeve. On the other side, this makes the operation simple. Because the tension part and the tension quantity equals to the arc length the shaft idled, this ingeniously resolves the flexible-rigid exchange issue. At the same time, this makes the flexible-rigid exchange simple.</p>
