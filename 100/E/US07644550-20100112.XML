<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to raised access floor panels. In particular, it relates to a raised access floor panel having articulating corner members for interchangeable fit when supported on an existing matrix of pedestal support members.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Access floors are of a double floored construction and are commonly used to create a free space between a sub-floor and the normal working environment of a room. Raised access floor systems are so constructed that floor panels are mounted on a surface of a base floor such as a concrete floor, by means of support pedestal legs, whereby the free space may be provided between the floor panels and the base floor. The pedestal support legs are stationary and are typically bolted to the surface of the base floor at a predetermined position. A corner portion of each of the floor panels is disposed at the upper end of the stationary pedestal support leg. Such systems are so constructed so as to provide an easy distribution of electric cables and ventilation duct work. Such systems are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,048,242 to Cline discloses an access floor system having a plurality of floor panels each having a pan and a cooperating top plate. The top plate is folded over a peripheral flange of the pan to define a hemmed edge. The support pedestal assembly includes a support plate configured to support the floor panels at their corners. T-shaped stringers are joined to the support plates in a grid-like pattern. The stringers are rigidly connected to the plates or snap-on to lock tabs defined by the plates. In this manner, the pedestals support the panels at their corners and additional support is achieved at the edges of the panels by the stringers. According to this construction, each support pedestal secured to a surface of a base floor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,072,557 to Nake et. al., discloses a device for fixing floor panels mounted on a surface of a base floor by means of using support legs which permit vertical adjustment of the floor panels. The fixing device includes a retainer plate, fixed to the base floor, for receiving the support legs, a support member extending vertically from the retainer plate and having an internally threaded portion, a panel holder, and a bearing member for the panel holder. The bearing member includes one end thereof threaded into the internally threaded portion of the support member for rotatable movement of the bearing member relative to the retainer plate. The bearing member is adapted to be accessible through the floor panels for operation. The panel holder is adapted to be engageable with the bearing member in order fix the floor panels.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While the foregoing systems disclose a plurality of floor panels of a type supported at a corner portion of each of the floor panels by a stationary pedestal support leg, a problem exists in the prior art because the floor panels themselves are not interchangeable in fit for support with other stationary pedestal support legs fixed on the base floor in predetermined positions which vary from room to room. This variance in position often requires that fabricators of replacement floor panels undergo a design-build approach when filling orders for a retrofit floor panel capable of support on a preexisting pedestal support system or when moving floor panels from room to room. The design-build approach is time consuming and often times requires the fabricator to redesign one panel at a time to the exacting dimensions of the remaining panels for a room for vertical and horizontal fit consistent with the preexisting pedestal support system. Therefore, what is needed is a floor panel which is designed for interchangeable fit with existing pedestal support systems having pedestal support legs fixed to a base floor at varying predetermined positions, and which is also capable of low cost mass production and inventory for rapid shipment and installation. The present invention satisfies these needs.</p>

The articulating corner brackets <b>20</b> are positioned below the upper surface <b>2</b> at each open corner portion <b>12</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>. The articulating corner brackets <b>20</b> are slidably connected to the lower plenum surface <b>4</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b> so that the brackets <b>20</b> are capable of free longitudinal movement, inwardly and outwardly, along a diagonal vector defined with respect to each corner of the floor panel <b>10</b>. A first diagonal clear slot <b>14</b>, having a centroid along the diagonal vector, may but need not, be provided at each corner of the floor panel <b>10</b> when the floor panel <b>10</b> includes a vertical adjustment feature.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is fabricated to include a threaded clear hole <b>22</b>, a pair of lateral clear slots <b>24</b> in parallel alignment with the first diagonal slot <b>14</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b> and two side walls <b>26</b> forming a corner portion <b>28</b> for support of the floor panel <b>10</b> on pedestal support legs of a pedestal support system, with or without stringers. The threaded clear hole <b>22</b> is positioned below the floor panel <b>10</b> diagonal clear slot <b>14</b> so that the clear hole <b>22</b> is accessible through the upper surface <b>2</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>. The articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> includes an upper horizontal surface <b>30</b> which is slidably fastened to the lower surface <b>4</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b> and is positioned adjacent to each corner of the floor panel so that the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is capable of free longitudinal movement along a diagonal vector defined with respect to the corner portion <b>32</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the preferred embodiment of the articulating floor panel assembly is shown in an exploded view from the underside, or lower surface <b>4</b>, of the floor panel <b>10</b>. The articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is adjustably secured to the underside of the floor panel <b>10</b> with nuts <b>34</b> threaded onto bolts <b>36</b> fastened to the lower surface <b>4</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>, one each in alignment with one each of the lateral clear slots <b>24</b> so that the threaded end of each one of the bolts <b>36</b> extends downwardly through one each of the clear slots <b>24</b> in the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b>. The sidewalls <b>26</b> of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> form a corner support portion <b>28</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>. The sidewalls <b>26</b> of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> desirably include lower flange <b>38</b> portions extending horizontally and inwardly for supporting a threaded cylinder <b>40</b>. A set screw <b>42</b>, having a threaded end <b>44</b> and a foot end <b>46</b> is threaded into the cylinder <b>40</b>. The screw <b>42</b> preferably includes a hex head <b>48</b> which, which when threaded into the cylinder <b>40</b> is accessible through the diagonal clear slot <b>14</b> in floor panel <b>10</b> corner portion. In this manner vertical adjustment of the floor panel <b>10</b> assembly is accomplished using a tool, such as a hex driver, to raise and lower the panel with respect to the pedestal support system. The cylinder <b>40</b> is preferably secured to the flange <b>38</b> portions of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> side walls <b>26</b> using a weld. As shown in the drawings, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is desirably fabricated by cutting a sheet of metal into a pattern and bending the pattern to form the sidewalls <b>26</b> and flange portions <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, and <b>6</b>, inward and outward movement of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> along the diagonal vector is shown in order to adjust the distance of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> in relation to the floor panel <b>10</b>. In this manner, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> serves as a corner of the floor panel <b>10</b> for support on a bearing surface of the pedestal support system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is slidably secured at a maximum distance outwardly in relation to the corner portion of the floor panel. As shown in the drawing figure, the clear hole <b>22</b> of the threaded cylinder <b>40</b> is maintained in alignment with the diagonal clear slot <b>14</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>. Section <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view illustrated as drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the externally threaded screw <b>42</b> is threaded into the internally threaded cylinder <b>40</b> whereby the tool receiving head <b>48</b> of the threaded end <b>44</b> of the screw <b>42</b> is accessible for vertical operational adjustment of the screw <b>42</b> from the upper surface <b>2</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b> through the diagonal clear slot <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the externally threaded screw <b>42</b> is fully tightened with respect to the internally threaded cylinder <b>40</b> so that a minimum vertical distance relative to the floor panel <b>10</b> and a bearing surface of the pedestal support system is achieved. The upper surface <b>30</b> of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is secured to the lower surface <b>4</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b> using a nut <b>34</b> threaded onto the bolt <b>36</b> which extends downwardly from the lower surface <b>4</b> of the floor panel <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is thereby fastened to the floor panel <b>10</b> at a maximum outward distance for adjusting the floor panel <b>10</b> to bear upon a pedestal support leg, or stringer, fixed at the floor panels <b>10</b> maximum overall dimensions. In the preferred embodiment, the maximum operational distance of the floor panel diagonal clear slot <b>14</b> and the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> clear slots <b>24</b> is in a range of 6.35 to 38.1 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is shown as positioned at its maximum inward position so that the floor panel <b>10</b> is at its minimum overall dimension with respect to a pedestal support system. Section <b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown as a sectional view in the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is now secured to the floor panel <b>10</b> at its maximum inward position to generate a floor panel <b>10</b> having a minimum overall supporting dimension, using a nut <b>34</b> threaded onto a bolt <b>36</b>. The nut <b>34</b> biases against the lower horizontal surface of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b>. Also shown in the drawing figure, the foot end <b>46</b> of the vertically adjustable screw <b>42</b> is now threaded downwardly using a hex head tool operated through the floor panel diagonal slot <b>14</b> so as to provide a greater overall vertical distance between the floor panel <b>10</b> and the pedestal support bearing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The foregoing articulating floor panel assembly is an assembly which is capable of mass production, but which is also interchangeable with pedestal support systems fixed at varying predetermined positions. In this manner, it is a cost effective assembly in fabrication and is capable of inventory for rapid shipment because it eliminates the design-build approach for floor panels of the preexisting art. When installing the floor panel to a preexisting pedestal support system, one simply measures the dimensions of a desired mounting point, slides the articulating corner brackets <b>20</b> inwardly or outwardly along the diagonal vector so that the side walls <b>26</b> of the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> are in alignment with the desired mounting point, and secures the articulating corner brackets <b>20</b> at the desired position. Moreover, when the articulating corner bracket <b>20</b> is fabricated to include the elements for vertical adjustment, the relative height of the floor panel with respect to a planer working surface is then adjusted by inserting a tool through the diagonal clear slot <b>14</b>, and the articulating corner bracket clear hole <b>22</b>, and operating the tool end <b>44</b> of the screw to achieve a relative distance between the floor panel <b>10</b> and the pedestal support system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the present invention has been described in connection with the illustrated embodiments, it will be appreciated and understood that modifications may be made without parting, from the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
