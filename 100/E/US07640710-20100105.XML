<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, the present invention relates to louvered or slatted panels that are used to cover ventilation openings in buildings. More particularly, the present invention relates to louvered or slatted replacement panels that can be retroactively installed into an existing opening.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Prior Art Statement</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many forms of construction contain attic crawl spaces. In order to prevent these crawl spaces from becoming overly hot during the summer, the crawl spaces are commonly vented to the outside. The venting allows fresh air to flow into the crawl space, thereby preventing any excessive build up of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One common technique used to vent attic crawl spaces is to provide a vent opening with a louvered cover. A louvered cover is a cover comprised of closely placed parallel slats. The slats are inclined and overlap to prevent rain from passing into the louvered cover. The tight spacing of the slats prevents birds, squirrels and other animals from passing into the vent opening. Screening is stretched behind the louvers to prevent insects from passing. Although the louvered configuration prohibits water and animals from entering a vent opening, the louvered configuration enables air to freely flow, thereby allowing for good ventilation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Louvered covers for attic vent openings have been used in the construction of buildings for hundreds of years. Early louvered covers were made from thin wooden slats. However, wooded slats tended to weather quickly and rot if not regularly maintained. In modern construction, louvered vent covers are typically molded from plastic. In this manner, the material of the louvered vent cover is inherently resistant to weathering.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Modern louvered vent covers are typically manufactured for new construction applications. That is, modern louvered vent covers are molded with a peripheral nailing flange. The nailing flange is a thin flange of plastic that extends outwardly from the periphery of the louvered vent cover. The nailing flange is larger than the vent opening. The nailing flange lays flush against the new construction of the wall that surrounds the vent opening. Nails are then driven through the nailing flange to hold the overall louvered vent covering in place. The louvered vent covering is nailed over a rough opening during construction. In this manner, the building's siding and trim can be installed around the louvered vent opening, thereby hiding the nailing flange. Prefabricated louvered vents covered with nailing flanges are exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,271 to Young, entitled Louvered Vent, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,191 to Porter, entitled Aluminum Air Vent Louver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although plastic louvered vent covers are weather resistant, nothing lasts forever. As plastic is exposed to the ultraviolet radiation of the sun, the plastic degrades over time and becomes brittle. Furthermore, wind, snow and ice repeatedly stress the louvers in the louvered vent cover, causing fatigue in the plastic. Eventually, plastic louvered vent covers break and require replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A problem occurs when a plastic louvered vent cover requires replacement. In order to place a new prior art louvered vent cover into place, the trim and siding surrounding the vent opening needs to be removed to make room for the nailing flange of the replacement cover. This is a very expensive and labor intensive endeavor. Alternatively, a contractor can nail the nailing flange over the top of a sided wall. This installation technique is quick and easy but makes the louvered vent cover unsightly. Furthermore, since the installation procedure is improvised, the plastic material of the louvered vent cover can be cracked by the random nail or screw insertion. The result is an unsecured louvered vent cover that can be displaced during a storm or other weather event.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need therefore exists for a replacement louvered vent cover that can be retroactively added to an existing finished vent opening without the need for removing surrounding trim and siding. A need also exists for such a louvered vent cover that is configured to be securely anchored into position without the need of an exposed nailing flange. These needs are met by the present invention as described and claimed below.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is a replacement ventilation cover and its method of installation in place of an old damaged ventilation cover. The replacement ventilation cover has a peripheral frame and an air permeable structure contained within the interior of the peripheral frame. Guides are prefabricated in the peripheral frame. The guides hold nails or screw at acute angles relative to the plane of the opening being covered.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To utilize the replacement ventilation cover, a central portion of the old, damaged ventilation cover is removed. This creates an opening without having to remove the nailing flange of the old ventilation cover. Consequently, the siding and trim around the vent opening does not have to be disturbed. The replacement ventilation cover is inserted into the remnants of the old ventilation cover. Nails or screws are then driven through the nail guides and into the construction under the old ventilation cover. The result is a new ventilation cover that is securely installed in a rapid fashion without disturbing the wall features surrounding the vent opening.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the present invention louvered vent cover can be used to cover many types of vent openings, such as round vent openings and triangular vent openings, the exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown covering a rectangular vent opening. The selection of such a shape is merely arbitrary and should not be considered a limitation to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an exemplary embodiment of the present invention louvered vent cover <b>10</b>. The louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is used to obstruct a vent opening <b>11</b> present in a building. The vent opening <b>11</b> exists within a finished wall. That is, the exterior of the vent opening <b>11</b> is surrounded by siding <b>15</b>. Depending upon the type of building construction and the age of the building construction, the vent opening may also be framed by decorative trim.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrated embodiment, the vent opening <b>11</b> is present in a finished exterior wall of modern construction. That is the vent opening <b>11</b> is present in a wall framed with two-by-four lumber, covered in sheathing panels and then sided using vinyl siding. The vent opening <b>11</b> defines an open space having a predetermined width W and a predetermined height H. The vent opening <b>11</b> is defined by an inner peripheral wall <b>14</b> that follows the outline of the vent opening <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The louvered vent cover <b>10</b> has a peripheral frame <b>18</b>. The peripheral frame <b>18</b> has a length and width that is slightly smaller than that of the vent opening <b>11</b>. Consequently, the peripheral frame <b>18</b> is sized to pass into the vent opening <b>11</b>. The peripheral frame <b>18</b> has a face surface <b>20</b> that faces forward away from the vent opening <b>11</b>. An air permeable structure <b>19</b> is present inside the peripheral frame <b>18</b>. The air permeable structure <b>19</b> can be any perforated or slatted construction used in construction venting. In the shown embodiment, the air permeable structure <b>19</b> is configured as a louvered structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The peripheral frame <b>18</b> and air permeable structure <b>19</b> can be made of wood or stamped from a sheet of aluminum. In the preferred embodiment, the entire replacement ventilation cover <b>10</b> is preferably molded from plastic. In this manner, the replacement ventilation cover <b>10</b> can be made in a very cost efficient manner. Furthermore, the replacement ventilation cover <b>10</b> will be lightweight and weather resistant.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As has been mentioned, the peripheral frame <b>18</b> has a width and height that is only slightly smaller than the vent opening <b>11</b>. Consequently, when the louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is inserted into the vent opening <b>11</b>, the peripheral frame <b>18</b> just passes into the vent opening <b>11</b>. However, the louvered vent cover <b>10</b> cannot be directly pressed into vent opening <b>11</b>. A tab <b>17</b> extends upwardly from the top rail <b>19</b> of the peripheral frame <b>18</b>. The tab <b>17</b> get tucked under the siding <b>15</b> as the louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is installed, as will later be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Once the tab <b>17</b> is tucked under the siding <b>15</b>, the louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is advanced into the vent opening <b>11</b> until the face surface <b>20</b> of the peripheral frame <b>18</b> lays in the same plane as the beginning of the vent opening <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be understood that the present invention louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is an aftermarket product that is intended to replace a broken existing vent cover <b>22</b>. In a structure where there is a typical prior art vent cover <b>22</b> that needs replacement, the broken louvers <b>23</b> are cut out of the vent cover <b>22</b>, without removing the existing vent cover <b>22</b> in its entirety. The broken louvers <b>23</b> can be cut away using a saw or utility knife, depending upon the material of the broken louvers <b>23</b>. Once the broken louvers <b>23</b> are removed, there is a vent opening <b>11</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that once the old louvers are cut away, all exposed pieces of the old vent cover are cut away until only the nailing flange <b>24</b> remains in place under the surrounding siding <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The siding <b>15</b> surrounding the vent opening <b>11</b> is nailed directly to the sheathing panels <b>19</b> of the wall, which are typically plywood. The sheathing panels <b>19</b> are nailed to the construction framework of the wall. Surrounding the vent opening <b>11</b>, the sheathing panels <b>19</b> are separated from the siding <b>15</b> by the presence of the nail flange <b>24</b> of the old vent cover. Using this separation, a contractor can place a crowbar or wedge in between the sheathing panel <b>19</b> and siding <b>15</b> at the top of the vent opening <b>11</b>. With little effort, the contractor should be able to create a gap between the sheathing <b>19</b> and the siding <b>15</b> of about &#x215b;<sup>th </sup>of an inch. Once this gap is created, the tab <b>17</b> at the top of the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is angled into the gap. The louvered vent cover is then pressed into the vent opening <b>11</b>, until the peripheral frame <b>18</b> of the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is flush with the sheathing panels <b>19</b> under the siding <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in unison, it will be understood that the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is sized to fit just within the vent opening <b>11</b> that has been created. The peripheral frame <b>18</b> of the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> passes into the vent opening <b>11</b>. The replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> passes into the vent opening <b>11</b> atop the remnants of the old vent cover <b>22</b>. The replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is advanced into the vent opening <b>11</b> until the peripheral frame <b>18</b> comes to lay in the same plane as the front edge <b>26</b> of the existing opening. A gap that is preferably no wider than &#xbc; inch exists between the interior of the venting opening <b>11</b> and the peripheral frame <b>18</b> of the replacement louvered cover <b>10</b>. This gap is sealed by a bead of caulk <b>27</b>. The peripheral frame <b>18</b> of the replacement louvered cover <b>10</b> does not contact the siding <b>15</b> surrounding the vent opening <b>11</b> and enables the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> to seat properly in the vent opening <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Nail guides <b>30</b> are formed into the peripheral frame <b>18</b> of the replacement louvered cover <b>10</b>. The nail guides <b>30</b> are reinforced conduits for nails <b>31</b>. The nail guides <b>30</b> hold and direct nails <b>31</b> at a particular angle so that the nails <b>31</b> will pass into the surrounding construction framework <b>32</b> of the vent opening <b>11</b> when hammered. The nail guides <b>30</b> hold the nail at an acute angle relative to the plane of the peripheral frame <b>18</b>. The nail guides <b>30</b> are positioned approximately one inch in from the front of the corners of the peripheral frame <b>18</b>. At such an angle and position, any nail <b>31</b> or screw driven through the nail guides <b>30</b> will enter the construction framework <b>32</b> that surrounds the vent opening <b>11</b>. In this manner, the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> can be anchored directly to the construction framework <b>32</b> of the building. The reinforced nail guides <b>30</b> prevent the structure of the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> from cracking or otherwise becoming damaged as a nail or screw is driven into the construction framework <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To install the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b>, the broken louvers <b>23</b> from an old vent cover <b>22</b> are cut away, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This creates a vent opening <b>11</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The creation of the vent opening <b>11</b> does not disrupt the siding <b>15</b> surrounding the vent opening <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the nailing flange <b>24</b> of the old vent cover <b>22</b> are left in place.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is inserted into the opening made in the old vent cover <b>22</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is then either nailed or screwed into place by driving a nail or screw through the nail guides <b>30</b> in the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will therefore be understood that using the present invention replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b>, a damaged old vent cover <b>22</b> can be quickly replaced using only a small amount of time and a small amount of labor. Furthermore, the installation of the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> has no effect on the siding <b>15</b> surrounding the vent opening <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment of the present invention thus illustrated, the replacement louvered vent cover <b>10</b> is a static structure. Consequently, different models of the louvered vent cover must be made for vent openings of different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a louvered vent cover <b>40</b> is shown. In this embodiment, the louvered vent cover <b>40</b> has a faceplate <b>42</b> that includes a top rail <b>44</b> and a bottom rail <b>46</b>. Both the top rail <b>44</b> and the bottom rail <b>46</b> have a telescopic construction that enables the lengths of these elements to be selectively adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Since the length of the faceplate <b>42</b> can be selectively adjusted, the louvers <b>48</b> must also be adjustable in length. In the shown embodiment, the louvers <b>48</b> are also made with a telescoping construction so that the louvers <b>48</b> can expand and contract with the top rail <b>44</b> and bottom rail <b>46</b> of the faceplate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By providing a replacement louvered vent cover <b>40</b> that can be selectively adjusted in length, a single replacement louvered vent cover can be used to cover a large variety of vent openings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be understood that the embodiments of the present invention replacement louvered vent cover that are illustrated are merely exemplary. The shape of the louvered vent cover need not be rectangular, but can be circular, oval, triangular or any other polygonal shape. It will also be understood that the number, size and configuration of the louvered vent is merely exemplary. The illustrated louvers are intended to be exemplary of any perforated surface that allows airflow but deters the entrance of animals, insects and rain. All such variations, modifications and alternate embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.</p>
