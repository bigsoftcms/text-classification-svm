<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a space-dividing wall panel as used in office areas and, more particularly, to a wall panel having glass panels which permit viewing therethrough.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Space-dividing wall panels are typically used in open office areas to subdivide a large office area into multiple workstations, meeting areas and the like. Most wall panels in a typical office area are covered on opposite sides thereof with solid cover panels so that the wall panel defines a physical and visual barrier as may be desired between adjacent workstations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some instances, however, it is desirable to be able to provide the wall panel with a window or define a glass wall that separates adjacent areas physically but not visually.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of a space-dividing wall panel is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,876,835 that discloses a portion of a wall panel having a glass tile that is mountable to the structural framework of the wall panel. The glass tile has a section of glass supported within a rectangular frame which frame is relatively large and obtrusive due to the thickness thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide a see-through wall panel which supports a glass panel thereon that has an improved visual appearance while using a reduced number of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, the invention relates to a see-through wall panel having a rectangular interior frame and glass panels supported on the opposite faces of the panel frame. Each glass panel includes a sheet of glass and vertical and horizontal edge rails which are mounted to the peripheral edges of the glass. While it is known to use elastomeric gaskets on window panes such as in fixed residential or office building windows, the edge rails in the inventive wall panel do not support the glass thereof through a gasket. Rather, in the preferred embodiment, the edge rails on opposite edges of the glass panel include elongate fixing channels in which respective sections of the edge of the glass are received and supported without a gasket therein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More particularly, the fixing channel in a particular edge rail is defined by outer and inner channel walls which are dimensioned to tight-fittingly receive the glass edge therein. At least one of the channel walls is resiliently deflectable to effectively define a cantilevered spring or jaw which acts against an opposing face of the glass so that the channel walls grip the glass within the channel. The deflectable channel wall generally extends parallel to the face of the glass and has a projection which projects in the direction of glass so that the channel wall preferably contacts the glass face solely through the projection. This reduces the contact area of the deflectable channel wall on the glass face.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As referenced above, the edge of the glass is tight-fittingly received within the fixing channel wherein the deflectable channel wall is deflectable to a relatively small extent to allow insertion of the glass edge and tight-fitting gripping thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While each edge rail preferably is formed of aluminum, it is preferable that the rail material be powder coated although this is not required for suitable gripping of the glass edge. Nevertheless, it is found that the thickness of the glass edge may vary due to tolerances in the glass. As a result, upon insertion of the glass within the rail channel, the edge of the glass may shave off some of the powder coating such that the powder coating serves to accommodate glass tolerances and maintain uniform contact between the glass face and the deflectable channel wall along the length of the fixing channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this arrangement as described in more detail herein, it is possible to minimize the edge rail thickness since only a small portion of the glass is received within the rail channels. This allows the exposed area of the glass to be maximized which thereby provides an improved aesthetic appearance. Furthermore, gaskets are not required in the rail channel which further simplifies construction and assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other objects and purposes of the invention, and variations thereof, will be apparent upon reading the following specification and inspecting the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the invention relates to a space-dividing wall panel <b>10</b> which includes glass panels <b>14</b> mounted to the opposite sides thereof. As will be described herein, the glass panels <b>14</b> have an improved construction which improves the manufacture and aesthetic appearance thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the wall panel <b>10</b> is used to physically subdivide an office area <b>15</b> into separate areas <b>16</b> for use as workstations, meeting rooms, hallways and the like. Accordingly, the wall panel <b>10</b> physically separates the areas <b>16</b> one from the other. However, while some conventional wall panels are provided with solid cover panels for visual privacy, the wall panel <b>10</b> includes glass panels <b>14</b> so that the wall panel <b>10</b> is see-through and thereby provides a more visually open office area.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wall panel <b>10</b> is adapted to be used in combination with additional wall panels to subdivide the office area <b>15</b> as mentioned above. Such additional wall panels can be solid wall panels such as an existing line of wall panels sold by the assignee hereof, Haworth, Inc., under the trademark PREMISE, wherein the solid wall panels provide physical and visual separation of the work areas <b>16</b>. Alternatively, wall panels <b>10</b> can be joined together to define a glass-walled area <b>16</b>. The general use of solid wall panels and wall panels having windows therein is known and a more detailed discussion thereof is not required herein. Rather, the following discussion is directed to the construction of the inventive wall panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">More particularly, the wall panel <b>10</b> includes an interior panel frame <b>18</b> which has a rectangular shape and defines an opening <b>19</b> through the open interior area thereof. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the panel frame <b>18</b> is defined by vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and upper and lower frame members <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> respectively which are joined together in a rectangular arrangement. This rectangular arrangement defines the opening <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bottom frame member <b>24</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref> is formed of extruded metal and extends transversely across the bottom of the frame <b>18</b>. The frame member <b>24</b> has an interior upper surface <b>25</b> which is arcuate and faces upwardly into the interior region of the frame <b>18</b> to thereby define the lower edge of the opening <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The side walls <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are formed with ribs that project inwardly to define upper screw bores <b>28</b> and lower screw bores <b>29</b>. The lower frame member <b>24</b> also includes a bottom wall <b>31</b> generally between the lower screw bores <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To support the glass panels <b>14</b>, a pair of support flanges <b>32</b> project downwardly from the bottom wall <b>31</b>. The flanges <b>32</b> are generally L-shaped and are defined by a vertical leg <b>33</b>, a horizontal leg <b>34</b> and a lip <b>35</b> which projects upwardly from the outer edge of the horizontal leg <b>34</b>. The flanges <b>32</b> thereby define horizontal slots <b>36</b> which extend along the transverse length of the frame member <b>24</b> on the opposite sides thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, the frame member <b>24</b> is powder coated or has another suitable aesthetic finish. As such, the side walls <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and the arcuate upper surface <b>25</b> define exposed surfaces which are visible through the glass panels <b>14</b>. As such, this frame member <b>24</b> as well as the remaining frame members <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> do not require additional trim pieces that might otherwise be required to define the visible surfaces of the panel frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b>, the upper frame member <b>23</b> is formed similar to the lower frame member <b>24</b>. In particular, the upper frame member <b>23</b> is formed of extruded metal or other suitable rigid material. The frame member <b>24</b> has a tubular shape defined by a lower wall having an interior lower surface <b>38</b>, opposite side walls <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> and an upper wall <b>41</b>. The side walls <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> and the lower surface <b>38</b> have an aesthetic finish such as powder coating since these surfaces also are visible through the glass panels <b>14</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To secure the upper frame member <b>23</b> to the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, the upper frame member <b>23</b> includes ribs that project inwardly to define upper and lower pairs of screw bores <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the opposite ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To support the glass panel <b>14</b>, the upper wall <b>41</b> has a stepped shape defined by mounting shoulders <b>45</b> which are spaced apart from each other in parallel relation. Each mounting shoulder <b>45</b> includes a plurality of screw holes <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) which are spaced apart on each shoulder <b>45</b> in the transverse direction. The screw holes <b>46</b> are provided to engage the upper edges of the glass panels <b>14</b> as will be described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mounting shoulders <b>45</b> furthermore define a central horizontal channel <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>) extending transversely along the length of the upper frame member <b>23</b>. The channel <b>48</b> is defined by channel sides <b>49</b> and a channel bottom <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are formed identical to each other except that the frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> face in opposite directions when connected together with the upper and lower frame members <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>. Generally, the upper and lower ends of the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are joined to the respective opposite ends of the horizontal frame members <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> to define the rectangular frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, the frame <b>18</b> is free of additional structure in the open interior region between the frame members <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> to define the opening <b>19</b> which opens therethrough. It will be understood, however, that the open interior region may include, for example, a decorative or solid panel to enclose the opening <b>19</b>. The decorative panel could be visible through the glass panels <b>14</b> to provide a visual barrier that has a different visual effect than that provided by conventional solid wall panels which typically have an outer skin covered by an aesthetic covering such as fabric, wood or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">More particularly, as to the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, the following discussion is directed to the frame member <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. However, the opposite frame member <b>21</b> is identical and thus, the following reference numerals are also used for frame member <b>21</b> and a separate discussion thereof is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The frame member <b>22</b> (<b>21</b>) includes an interior wall <b>55</b> and side walls <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> which are all provided with a finished exterior surface since these surfaces will be visible during use.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The upper end <b>58</b> and the lower end <b>59</b> of the frame member <b>22</b> are each provided with screw holes <b>61</b> to permit fastening of the upper and lower ends <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> to the adjacent ends of the upper and lower frame members <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>. The screw holes <b>61</b> in the lower end <b>59</b> align with the pairs of screw bores <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> in the respective end of the lower frame member <b>24</b>, while the screw holes <b>61</b> in the upper end <b>58</b> align with the screw bores <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> in the respective end of the upper frame member <b>24</b>. The adjacent ends of the frame members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> thereby are aligned one with each other, and thereafter the screws <b>62</b> are screwed through the holes <b>61</b> into the aligned bores <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> to join the frame members <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> into the rectangular configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The frame member <b>22</b> also includes gasket mounts <b>63</b> adjacent each side wall <b>56</b> and <b>57</b>. The gasket mounts <b>63</b> each include a T-shaped gasket slot <b>64</b> extending along the vertical length of the frame member <b>22</b>. The gasket slot <b>64</b> has an opening <b>65</b> which extends intermittently along the length thereof (due to the presence of the screw holes <b>61</b>) and opens sidewardly.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A gasket <b>66</b> having a corresponding T-shape is slidably fitted vertically into one of the open ends of the gasket slot <b>64</b>. Since the slot <b>64</b> is spaced outwardly of the holes <b>61</b>, the gasket <b>66</b> is able to slide past the screws <b>62</b>. The gasket <b>66</b> includes a gasket lip <b>67</b> which projects outwardly of the slot opening <b>65</b> and is provided to sealingly engage the glass panel <b>14</b> as will be described herein to prevent migration of dirt and the like into the open interior region of the panel frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, the wall panel <b>10</b> is adapted to route cabling such as for electrical power to a workstation <b>16</b> and accordingly, the panel frame <b>18</b> includes a raceway <b>70</b> at the bottom end thereof. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, the raceway <b>70</b> includes a raceway cover arrangement <b>71</b> that defines a horizontally elongate open channel in which cabling can be received.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">More particularly, the cover arrangement <b>71</b> includes a horizontal generally U-shaped mounting channel <b>72</b> which fits within a corresponding groove <b>73</b> that is formed on the bottom surface of the lower frame member <b>24</b>. The mounting channel <b>72</b> is adapted to receive therein a pair of support posts <b>74</b> which are fixed to the lower frame member <b>24</b> by respective fasteners <b>75</b> and project downwardly therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mounting post <b>75</b> is adapted to receive a raceway cover <b>77</b> thereon which cover <b>77</b> is generally U-shaped and defines the raceway channel <b>78</b> within the hollow interior thereof. The raceway cover <b>77</b> includes outlet openings <b>80</b> which openings <b>80</b> are adapted to receive a bezel <b>81</b> and bezel cover <b>82</b> for access to conventional electrical receptacles.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, a power distribution assembly <b>85</b> also is mounted to the mounting channel <b>72</b> transversely between the mounting posts <b>74</b>. The power distribution assembly <b>85</b> is conventional and thus, a more detailed description of the power distribution assembly <b>85</b> and the associated raceway arrangement <b>71</b> is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring more particularly to the glass panels <b>14</b>, the glass panels <b>14</b> are each formed from a sheet of glass <b>90</b> and an edge rail frame <b>91</b> which supports the periphery of the glass sheet <b>90</b>. The glass panel <b>14</b> is adapted to be secured at the top and bottom edges thereof to the respective upper and lower frame members <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> of the panel frame <b>18</b> so as to close off the open interior region of the panel frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">More particularly, the sheet of glass is square cut to define a plurality of glass edges <b>92</b> and <b>93</b>. Preferably, the glass <b>90</b> has a rectangular shape defined by a vertically spaced apart pair of horizontal top and bottom glass edges <b>92</b> which are substantially parallel to each other, and by a laterally spaced apart pair of vertical side glass edges <b>93</b>. As discussed herein, at least the vertical glass edges <b>93</b> preferably are parallel to each other since these glass edges <b>93</b> are compression fit into the edge rail frame <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The glass preferably has a thickness of 0.130&#xb1;0.010 inches. With this arrangement of the edge rail frame <b>91</b> and the glass <b>90</b>, the glass thickness used herein is less than the glass thickness typically used in the furniture industry which provides a further weight and cost advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">More specifically, the thickness of the glass is defined between the outer glass face <b>94</b> and the inner glass face <b>95</b> as generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>. Further, each of the edge sections <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> terminates at a glass end face <b>96</b> which extends around the entire periphery of the glass <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The glass <b>90</b> as used in the glass panel <b>14</b> preferably is tempered glass and the aesthetic appearance thereof may be varied. For example, in some applications it may be desirable to provide smoked glass while in other cases it may be desirable to use clear glass, etched glass or even glass having imprinting thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As to the construction of the rail frame <b>91</b>, a plurality of edge rails are joined together in a rectangular configuration and more particularly the rail frame <b>91</b> comprises an upper edge rail <b>98</b>, a bottom edge rail <b>99</b> which is substantially parallel to the upper edge rail <b>98</b>, and a pair of parallel vertical edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> which extend vertically between the upper and lower edge rails <b>98</b> and <b>99</b>. Each of the edge rails <b>98</b>, <b>99</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> are formed of extruded powder coated aluminum as described in further detail herein. The individual edge rails <b>98</b> to <b>101</b> are joined together at the corners of the glass frame <b>91</b> by fasteners <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As to the bottom edge rail <b>99</b>, the cross-sectional shape of the bottom edge rail <b>99</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The bottom edge rail <b>99</b> extends horizontally and includes a hook <b>104</b> along the transverse length thereof which projects downwardly and inwardly towards the panel frame <b>18</b>. The hook <b>104</b> is adapted to hook into the support flange <b>31</b> defined on the bottom of the horizontal frame member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, fastener bores <b>105</b> are provided at the opposite ends of the edge rail <b>99</b>. To support the glass <b>90</b>, the bottom edge rail <b>99</b> includes a support channel <b>107</b> which extends horizontally along the lateral length thereof and opens upwardly to receive the bottom edge region <b>92</b>. The support channel <b>107</b> includes an upstanding outer wall <b>108</b> which confines the lower glass edge therein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the upper edge rail <b>98</b> also is horizontally elongate and has a channel wall <b>109</b> which defines a downward opening channel <b>110</b> along the lateral length thereof for receiving the uppermost edge of the glass <b>91</b>. Notably both the lower support channel <b>107</b> and the upper support channel <b>110</b> are dimensioned to be slightly greater than the thickness of the glass <b>91</b> so as to provide a snug but still readily removable fit between the upper and lower edge rails <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> and the respective upper and lower edges of the glass <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The upper edge rail <b>98</b> further includes a fastener bore <b>111</b> at each opposite end thereof for connection to the side rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the upper edge rail <b>98</b> includes a flange <b>112</b> which projects rearwardly so as to overlie the mounting shoulders <b>45</b> on the upper frame member <b>23</b>. The mounting flange <b>112</b> includes a plurality of fastener holes <b>131</b> projecting vertically therethrough which holes <b>113</b> are adapted to be aligned with the corresponding fastener holes <b>46</b> formed in the upper frame member <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">During assembly, the glass panel <b>90</b> is first hooked onto the lower frame member <b>24</b> by engaging the hook <b>104</b> with the corresponding flange <b>32</b> and then the upper edge of the glass panel <b>90</b> is pivoted about the flange <b>104</b> generally backwardly toward the wall panel frame <b>18</b>. Once the glass panel <b>14</b> lies against the panel frame <b>18</b>, the mounting flange <b>113</b> on the top edge rail <b>98</b> overlies the mounting shoulder <b>45</b>. Thereafter, suitable fasteners <b>115</b> are engaged through the mounting holes <b>113</b> and <b>46</b> to secure the top edge of the glass panel <b>14</b> in place. Thereafter, an appropriate plastic top cap <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is snapped into the central channel <b>48</b> of the upper frame member <b>23</b> to cover the fasteners <b>115</b> and provide an aesthetic, finished appearance for the wall panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, the opposite side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> are formed identical to each other except that these components have a reverse orientation. Thus, the following discussion is primarily directed to the right edge rail <b>101</b> although it is understood that this discussion is equally applicable to the left edge rail <b>100</b> and as such, identical reference numerals are used to identify the same features on both of the edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Generally, the upper and lower ends of each edge rail <b>101</b> includes fastener holes therethrough which allow the fasteners <b>103</b> to be inserted therethrough into threaded engagement with either the respective fastener bore <b>105</b> of the lower edge rail <b>99</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or the fastener bore <b>111</b> in the upper edge rail <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Thus, the corners of the edge rail frame <b>91</b> are joined together by the corner fasteners <b>103</b> so that the horizontal upper and lower edge rails <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> and the vertical side rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> are fixedly joined together in a rectangular configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To support the glass <b>90</b>, each of the side edge rails <b>101</b> or <b>100</b> includes a fixing channel <b>120</b> that extends vertically along the vertical length thereof and opens sidewardly to receive the respective glass edge section <b>93</b> therein. While a more detailed discussion of this engagement is provided hereinafter, generally, the glass edges <b>93</b> are tight-fittingly received within the fixing channel <b>120</b> without the use of separate gaskets and accordingly, the fixing channel <b>120</b> provides rigid support to the vertical glass edge regions <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">More particularly, the edge rail <b>101</b> (<b>100</b>) includes a sidewall <b>121</b> which extends rearwardly and is adapted to be disposed outwardly of the side faces <b>122</b> of the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. Thus, as the glass panel <b>14</b> is swung upwardly to the mounted position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sidewall <b>121</b> engages the gasket <b>66</b> adjacent thereto. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the edge rail <b>101</b> is provided with a rib <b>123</b> which extends along the vertical length of the side edge rail <b>101</b> and projects sidewardly towards the frame face <b>122</b>. The rib <b>123</b> generally serves as a locator rib to roughly align the glass panel <b>14</b> sidewardly adjacent to the vertical frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> during installation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The side wall <b>121</b> also includes a shorter ridge or bead <b>125</b> which extends along the vertical length of the edge rail <b>101</b> and projects sidewardly although the height of the ridge <b>125</b> is less than the height of the locator rib <b>123</b>. When fully installed, the rib <b>125</b> contacts the gasket lip <b>67</b> and pushes the lip <b>67</b> rearwardly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. When the glass panel <b>14</b> is fully seated in place, the ridge <b>125</b> moves past a bend <b>126</b> which forms in the gasket lip <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Due to the amount of material confined at the bend <b>126</b>, the bend <b>126</b> effectively defines a catch for the ridge <b>125</b> which serves to positively restrain the side edge rail <b>101</b> in the fully seated position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Furthermore, the gasket <b>67</b> serves as a seal to prevent migration of dust, dirt and the like into the hollow interior region of the panel frame <b>18</b>. In this manner, the glass <b>90</b> is pulled closely against the opposing walls of the panel frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">More particularly as to the fixing channel <b>120</b>, the fixing channel <b>120</b> is defined by an upstanding exterior channel wall <b>127</b>, an interior deflectable channel wall <b>128</b> and a channel end face <b>129</b> that is defined by the side wall <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, the exterior channel wall <b>127</b> projects upwardly from the side wall <b>121</b> and preferably has a dimension of approximately 0.25 inches as indicated by dimension line <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Dimension line <b>130</b> represents the overall exterior thickness of the edge rail <b>101</b> which thereby provides an improved visual appearance to minimize the overall noticeability of the edge rail <b>101</b>. This quarter inch dimension of the reveal is also used on the upper and lower edge rails <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> so that a consistent 0.25 inch reveal is used on the rail frame <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The distance between the outer distal tip <b>131</b> of the outer channel wall <b>127</b> and the channel end face <b>129</b> is indicated by dimension line <b>132</b>. This represents the depth of the fixing channel <b>120</b> and is the maximum depth that the glass edge <b>93</b> may be inserted therein. This distance is selected so that it is great enough that upon bowing of the glass <b>90</b> which may occur during normal use, the glass edge does not slide out of the fixing channel <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As for the deflectable channel wall <b>128</b>, this channel wall effectively defines a cantilevered spring force which serves to grip the glass edge <b>93</b>. In particular, the channel wall <b>128</b> includes a cantilevered section <b>134</b> having an interior base end which is integrally formed with the side wall <b>121</b>. The cantilevered section <b>134</b> is resiliently deflectable away from the fixed exterior channel wall <b>127</b>, and to facilitate deflection of the cantilevered section <b>134</b>, undercuts <b>135</b> are provided along the opposite sides of the cantilevered section <b>134</b>. The outer end of the cantilevered section <b>134</b> includes a rib-like projection <b>136</b> which projects into the fixing channel <b>120</b> and converges to a peak <b>137</b> at the tip thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The tip <b>137</b> is adapted to contact the interior face <b>95</b> of the glass <b>90</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> to effectively define a point contact between the peak <b>137</b> and the opposing glass face <b>95</b>. Furthermore, the projection <b>136</b> serves to space the cantilevered section <b>134</b> away from the glass face <b>95</b> such that upon deflection of the channel wall <b>128</b> as diagrammatically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the projection <b>136</b> continues to be the only portion of the channel wall <b>128</b> in contact with the glass <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The peak <b>137</b> is spaced rearwardly away from the interior surface of the exterior channel wall <b>127</b> by a distance indicated by reference arrow <b>140</b>. The distance <b>140</b> is less than the thickness of the glass <b>90</b> as indicated by reference arrow <b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> such that upon insertion of the glass into the fixing channel <b>120</b>, the thicker dimension of the glass <b>90</b> causes the deflectable channel wall <b>128</b> to flex outwardly away therefrom. The flexing of the channel wall <b>128</b> is generally indicated by dotted line <b>142</b> that represents the plane of the back face of the channel wall <b>128</b> which noticeably is at an angle relative to the plane of the glass face <b>95</b>. Since the peak <b>137</b> defines a point contact, the gripping force acting on the glass face <b>95</b> acts at the peak <b>137</b>. Therefore, the effective length of the deflectable channel wall <b>128</b> is indicated by reference arrow <b>143</b> which is the distance between the undercuts <b>135</b> and the peak <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">By providing the undercuts <b>135</b>, this effective length of the channel wall <b>128</b> is increased to make the channel wall <b>128</b> more deflectable while at the same time serving to eliminate stress risers which might otherwise occur at the base end <b>144</b> of the cantilevered section <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With the foregoing arrangement, the glass <b>90</b> is tight-fittingly received within the fixing channel <b>120</b> and is gripped therein by compression of the glass edge region <b>93</b> between the opposing interior surfaces of the exterior channel wall <b>127</b> and the deflectable channel wall <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The channel walls <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> are formed of a rigid material, preferably extruded aluminum such that insertion of the glass <b>90</b> within the fixing channel <b>120</b> causes actual deflection of the channel wall <b>128</b>. As such, no gaskets are provided within the fixing channel <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">While the interior surfaces of the channel walls <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> may be exposed metal, the edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> preferably have a coating thereon which coating is a urethane powder coat having a thickness in the range of 3 to 5.5 mills. Due to variations in tolerance in the waviness or the thickness of the glass faces <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>, the powder coating may be shaved off to provide a surface that conforms to variations in the glass surface <b>95</b>. This ensures continuous contact of the peak <b>137</b> with the glass face <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">More particularly as to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the channel walls <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> are diagrammatically illustrated therein, each having a respective layer <b>146</b> and <b>147</b> of a coating, namely the aforementioned powder coating. The opposite faces of the glass <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> also are diagrammatically illustrated therein wherein waviness or variations in thickness of the glass <b>90</b> is illustrated in an exaggerated manner for diagrammatic purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Due to waviness in the glass <b>90</b>, the coating <b>146</b> or <b>147</b> may be shaved in isolated areas <b>148</b> and <b>149</b> which reduces the overall thickness of the powder coating in these shaved or sheared areas <b>148</b> and <b>149</b>. Also, thicker areas <b>150</b> and <b>151</b> are illustrated having a thickness which is closer to the original thickness of the coatings <b>146</b> and <b>147</b>. Thus, upon insertion of the glass <b>90</b> into the fixing channel <b>120</b>, the glass <b>90</b> would not only deflect the channel wall <b>128</b> outwardly but also may shave off or shear portions of the coating layer <b>146</b> or <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, while the coating <b>146</b>/<b>147</b> is not required, the coating <b>146</b>/<b>147</b> also provides an additional advantage of providing uniform interior surfaces which conforms to the glass faces <b>94</b> and <b>95</b></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For assembly of the glass panel <b>14</b>, the rail frame <b>91</b> is assembled by first assembling the bottom edge rail <b>99</b> to the left edge rail <b>100</b> into an L-shaped piece, and similarly joining the right edge rail <b>101</b> to the upper edge rail <b>98</b> into another L-shaped piece. The upper and lower edge rails <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> are placed on the respective upper and lower edges of the glass to place and locate the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> next to the side edge regions <b>93</b> of the glass <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> must be forced onto the side glass edges <b>93</b>, the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> in the initial stage of assembly are not yet fixed onto the glass edges <b>93</b>. Once the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> are positioned relative to the side glass edges <b>93</b>, an assembly fixture is provided to force fit the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> onto the glass side edges <b>93</b>. Thereafter, the two L-shaped pieces are joined together by inserting the remaining corner fasteners <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thereafter, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lower edge rail <b>99</b> is hooked onto the lower frame member <b>24</b> of the panel frame <b>18</b> and then the upper end of the glass panel <b>14</b> is swung toward the upper frame member <b>23</b>. During this operation, the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> fit over the respective side frame members <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> until the ridges or beads <b>125</b> of the side edge rails <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> fully engage the gaskets <b>66</b>. Thereafter, the top fastener screws <b>115</b> are threaded through the upper edge rail <b>98</b> into threaded fixed engagement with the upper frame member <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once the glass panel <b>14</b> is installed in place, a wall panel <b>10</b> having an improved esthetic appearance is provided. In particular as generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the edge frame <b>91</b> only has a small reveal of 0.25 inches so that the majority of the surface area of the wall panel <b>10</b> is exposed glass. The aesthetic appearance of the wall panel is further improved in that the front and interior faces of the frame members of the panel frame <b>18</b> are still visible through the glass as generally illustrated in the upper right corner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The above-described wall panel thereby has an improved construction relative to existing glass panel frames.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although a particular preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed in detail for illustrative purposes, it will be recognized that variations or modifications of the disclosed apparatus, including the rearrangement of parts, lie within the scope of the present invention.</p>
