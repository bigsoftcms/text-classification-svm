<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to lock mechanisms, and more particularly, to a lock portion having a deformable feature for increased strength.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional lock mechanisms, such as Small Format Interchangeable Core (SFIC) locks, are designed to provide a secure and strong lock in a small space. A typical lock includes the basic components of a body, a rotatable cylinder or plug positioned within the body and a series of pins or tumblers. When locked, the pins extend from the cylinder into the body to prevent rotation of the cylinder relative to the body. A specifically shaped key inserted in a keyhole within the cylinder engages the pins and moves them such that the cylinder is free to rotate relative to the body, thus unlocking the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To provide adequate security, the lock must be configured to resist over-rotation, or over-torque, of the cylinder. Conventionally, the tumblers are designed to resist such over-rotation. For example, most conventional locks employ between five and seven tumblers to resist over-torque of the cylinder. With a greater number of tumblers, however, less space remains available within the lock for other features, e.g., additional security measures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a lock mechanism that overcomes the drawbacks of known locks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described herein are embodiments directed to a lock with deformable features designed to allow normal operation of the lock, but also designed to deform when an excessive force, i.e., a force in excess of a predetermined force, such as an over-torque, is applied to a secured lock to prevent the lock from unlocking.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one exemplary embodiment, a portion of a lock may include a stationary member having a bore, where the stationary member can be mountable to an object. The portion of the lock can also include a movable member positioned at least partially within the bore and movable relative to the bore in an unlocking direction during a normal unlocking operation. A deformable portion can be positioned adjacent an interface between the stationary member and the movable member. The deformable portion permits the movable member to move in the unlocking direction during a normal unlocking operation and is deformable to prevent movement of the movable member relative to the stationary member when subjected to excessive force applied in an attempt to move the movable member in the unlocking direction in other than a normal unlocking operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations, the movable member is rotatable relative to the bore. In specific implementations, the deformable portion includes two spaced apart outwardly extending projections. In other implementations, the deformable portion can include fewer or more than two spaced apart outwardly extending projections. In some implementations, the deformable portion is formed as one piece with the movable member. In yet other implementations, the deformable portion comprises a resilient member, such as, for example, a leaf wire or leaf spring, that is coupled to the movable member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, the portion of a lock can include a locking member engageable with the stationary member and movable member to resist movement of the movable member relative to the stationary member. The locking member can be positioned adjacent the deformable portion such that the excessive force applied to the movable member causes the locking member to deform the deformable portion. In certain implementations, the bore may include a channel and at least a portion of the locking member can be positionable in the channel to place the lock in a locked mode and removable from the channel to place the lock in an unlocked mode. In certain implementations, the deformable portion is positioned along at least one side of the channel adjacent the locking member. In some aspects of the portion of a lock, the locking member can apply a pressure against the deformable portion when the lock is in a locked state and a torsional moment is applied to the movable member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, the portion of a lock can include at least one tumbler positioned within the movable member and contactable with the locking member. The tumbler can be raisable to urge the locking member into engagement with the stationary member and lowerable to move the locking member out of engagement with the stationary member. In certain implementations, biasing elements can be coupled to the at least one tumbler to bias the tumbler in a raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the movable member includes a recess formed therein. The recess can have a ledge portion where deformation of the deformable portion allows the locking member to contact the ledge portion and the stationary portion to prevent movement of the movable member relative to the stationary member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the portion of the key can include a keyed feature engageable with the moving member to cause the locking member to disengage the stationary member, which allows movement of the movable member relative to the stationary member. In specific implementations, the key can have a memory containing lock access information. The inner core can include an electronic circuit coupled to an actuating device. The circuit can be configured to receive the lock access information stored in the key memory and activate the actuating device to disengage the locking bar from the stationary member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another exemplary embodiment, an anti-attack portion of a lock can include a stationary outer body that has a generally circular bore with a channel formed therein. The anti-attack portion of the lock can also include a rotatable generally cylindrical inner core positioned at least partially within the circular bore and rotatable relative to the stationary outer body. The inner core may have a recess formed therein. The anti-attack portion can also include deformable members adjacent an interface between the stationary outer body and the rotatable cylindrical inner core. A movable locking member positioned at least partially within the recess and between the deformable members. A portion of the movable locking member can be engageable with the channel to resist rotation of the inner core relative to the outer body when the lock is in a locked state and disengageable from the channel when the lock is in an unlocked state. Rotation of the inner core relative to the outer body when the lock is in the locked state urges the locking member against at least one of the deformable members. Further rotation exceeding a predetermined torsional force causes the locking member to deform at least one of the deformable members, thereby preventing rotation of the inner core relative to the outer body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some implementations, the deformable members can comprise one or more projections extending from the cylindrical core. In other implementations, the deformable members can comprise one or more resilient members, such as, but not limited to, a spring wire or leaf spring, coupled to the cylindrical core.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations, the portion of the movable locking member can be movable away from the channel to place the lock in an unlocked state and allow rotation of the inner core relative to the outer body. The anti-attack portion of a lock can also include a key engageable with the rotatable cylindrical inner core where the key manipulates a mechanism and allows the locking member to move away from the channel. In specific implementations, the key can have a memory containing lock access information. The inner core can include an electronic circuit that is coupled to an actuating device. The circuit can receive the lock access information stored in the key and activate the actuating device to move the locking member away from the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, one or more movable tumbler pins can be positioned within the inner core and coupled to the locking member. The tumbler pins are blocked to maintain engagement between the locking member and the channel or unblocked to allow the locking member to disengage from the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present application will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of a lock with deformable features that allow normal operation of the lock, but deform to prevent operation of the lock when a force above a predetermined threshold is applied to a secured lock (i.e., a &#x201c;locked&#x201d; lock) are described herein. As used herein, deformable features refers to structural elements in the lock that deform from their normal configuration to a deformed configuration when subjected to excess force. The deformed features may be irreversibly deformed, e.g., due to bending, breaking or other type of mechanical deformation, or they may be reversibly deformed, i.e., changed in shape or position from their normal configuration and capable of being returned to their normal configuration after they are subjected to the excess force (e.g., springs or other resilient elements).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, according to one exemplary embodiment, a deformable lock mechanism, or system, <b>10</b> includes a movable member, e.g., a rotatable inner core <b>12</b>, operatively coupled to a stationary member, i.e., an outer body <b>14</b>, and a key <b>16</b> engageable with the rotatable inner core <b>12</b>. As with conventional locks, the lock mechanism <b>10</b> can secure a container or object. For example, the inner core <b>12</b> can be coupled to a latching mechanism, such as a cam and bolt, that is engageable with a secure portion of a container or object, such as a door frame or safe wall. Rotation, or other movement, of the inner core <b>12</b> disengages the latching mechanism from the secured container or object to gain access to the container or objects.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, the outer body <b>14</b> can have the same outer configuration as a conventional lock, such that the lock system <b>10</b> can be used to retrofit a conventional lock. For example, the outer body could have a SFIC-type outer configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rotatable inner core <b>12</b> includes a plug <b>18</b> having a generally cylindrical shape. An elongate locking member receiving recess <b>20</b> can have a generally v-shaped cross-section with a curved vertex <b>43</b> and a ledge <b>45</b> extending away from the vertex (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The recess can extend generally parallel with an axis of the plug <b>18</b> and can be formed in an outer surface of the plug intermediate a first front, or key receiving, end <b>47</b> and a second rear end <b>49</b> of the plug. Spaced apart deformable members can be attached to or formed as one piece with the rotatable inner core <b>12</b> or the outer body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, deformable members, such as projections <b>22</b>, can be integral with the recess <b>20</b> of the inner core <b>12</b> and positioned intermediate a locking bar pivoting end <b>24</b> and a tumbler receiving end <b>25</b> of the recess. The projections <b>22</b> are spaced apart a distance slightly greater than a width of a locking member, such as locking bar <b>26</b>, and facilitate at least partial vertical alignment of a locking bar <b>26</b> as the bar moves through its nominal range of motion, as will be described below in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, or in combination with the projections <b>22</b>, the deformable members can be one or more resilient members <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>). The resilient member or members <b>31</b> can be integral with the rotatable inner core <b>12</b>, integral with the outer body <b>14</b>, or be one or more separate parts coupled to the inner core <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or outer body <b>14</b>. The resilient member <b>31</b> could be, for example, one or more spring wires and/or leaf springs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiments, the locking member is a locking bar <b>26</b> having a generally elongate cylindrical shape with a slightly rounded pivoting end <b>23</b> and an outer body engaging end <b>27</b>. The locking bar <b>26</b> can be a standard hardened dowel pin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pivoting end <b>24</b> of the recess <b>20</b> can be slightly cupped and configured to receive the rounded pivoting end <b>23</b> of the locking bar <b>26</b> and to facilitate movement of the bar relative to the recess, such as vertically oriented rotation of the bar about its pivoting end when coupled to the recess <b>20</b>. The tumbler receiving end <b>25</b> of the recess <b>20</b> can include a slot, or opening, <b>28</b> and adjoining openings <b>29</b> extending perpendicular to the axis of the plug <b>18</b> with each opening having a smaller cross-section than the slot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The slot <b>28</b> is sized to receive two tumbler pins <b>30</b> and a support element <b>32</b>, and each opening <b>29</b> is configured to receive and align a respective tumbler pin. The support element <b>32</b> includes spaced apart openings through which each tumbler pin <b>30</b> extends up to a stop <b>34</b> formed in or coupled to the pins <b>30</b>. Biasing elements, such as compression springs <b>35</b>, can be coupled to the pins <b>30</b> and a tumbler stopping member, or members, <b>37</b> can be selectively movable to a position underneath the tumbler pins <b>30</b> to prevent downward movement, i.e., movement away from a channel <b>40</b>, as will be discussed below, of the tumbler pins. With the tumbler pins <b>30</b> being prevented from downward movement, engagement between the locking bar <b>26</b> and the channel <b>40</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plug <b>18</b> can include a keyhole <b>38</b> extending from the key receiving end <b>47</b> of the plug and sized to receive the key <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the illustrated embodiments, the key <b>16</b> is an &#x201c;uncut&#x201d; key having a generic configuration (with the individualized function of the key being performed by the circuit <b>60</b> discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the rotatable inner core <b>12</b> can be assembled by coupling the springs <b>35</b> to the tumbler pins <b>30</b> and inserting each tumbler pin into the slot <b>28</b> and a respective opening <b>29</b> such that the springs are positioned between the tumbler pin stops <b>34</b> and the openings <b>29</b>. The support element <b>32</b> is inserted into the slot <b>28</b> such that upper ends of the tumbler pins extend into the openings in the support element and the support element rests on an upper surface of the stop <b>34</b>. In this position, the springs <b>35</b> urge the tumbler pins <b>30</b> upward such that the upper surface of the support element <b>32</b>, with the springs fully extended, is elevated above a lower surface of the recess <b>20</b>. The locking bar <b>26</b> is positioned within the recess <b>20</b> and between the projections <b>22</b>, or alternatively, as shown in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, between an at least partially flexible portion of the resilient member <b>31</b>, such that the rounded pivoting end <b>23</b> of the bar contacts the cupped portion <b>24</b> of the recess and outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the bar contacts an upper surface of the support element <b>32</b>. The locking bar <b>26</b> is thus angled with respect to the axis of the plug <b>18</b> such that the rounded pivoting end <b>23</b> is positioned lower, i.e., closer to the axis of the plug <b>18</b>, than the outer body engaging end <b>27</b> and the end <b>27</b> extends outwardly beyond the outer surface of the plug <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer body <b>14</b> includes a bore <b>36</b> extending through the body. The bore <b>36</b> has an inner diameter just larger than an outer diameter of the plug <b>18</b>, i.e., sized to rotatably receive the plug <b>18</b>. The bore <b>36</b> can include a locking member receiving channel <b>40</b> formed in a sidewall of the bore and extending generally parallel to an axis of the bore <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The channel <b>40</b> is positioned intermediate and generally away from the ends of the bore <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The channel <b>40</b> is sized and shaped to matingly receive the outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the locking bar <b>26</b>, when aligned with the channel. In the illustrated embodiments, the locking member receiving channel <b>40</b> has a generally semi-circular cross-section with a radius corresponding to a radius of the locking bar <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, the locking member can be a locking bar having other elongate shapes, such as, for example, rectangular, triangular and ovular, and the channel can be similarly sized and shaped. Alternatively, the locking member can be a non-elongated element, such as a sphere, with a correspondingly sized and shaped channel.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in the illustrated embodiments, in some implementations, the outer body <b>14</b> can be designed for accommodation in most lock receiving devices. For example, the outer body <b>14</b> can include a lower bore containing portion <b>50</b> having a cylindrical shape adjoined to an upper securing portion <b>52</b> also having a cylindrical shape. In other implementations, the outer body <b>14</b> can have a generally rectangular, circular, triangular, or other desirable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The assembled rotatable inner core <b>12</b> is inserted into the lock bore <b>36</b> formed in the outer body <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As the inner core <b>12</b> is inserted into the bore <b>36</b>, the portion of the locking bar <b>26</b> extending outwardly away from the outer surface of the plug <b>18</b> contacts a sidewall of the bore <b>36</b>, which exerts an inwardly directed pressure, which overcomes the biasing force of the springs to urge the locking bar <b>26</b> inwardly, i.e., toward the axis of the plug <b>18</b>. In this position, the entire locking bar <b>26</b> is approximately flush with the outer surface of the plug <b>18</b>. As the inner core <b>12</b> is properly inserted into the bore <b>36</b> and the locking bar <b>26</b> of the rotatable core <b>12</b> is aligned with the locking member receiving channel <b>40</b> of the bore, the outwardly biasing springs <b>35</b> urge the tumbler pins <b>30</b>, support element <b>32</b> outwardly and the outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the locking bar correspondingly moves outwardly and into the channel <b>40</b>. The tumbler stopping member <b>37</b> is then moved underneath the tumblers <b>30</b> to place the lock mechanism <b>10</b> in a locked position or state (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With fewer components in the inner core and the outer body, the lock mechanism <b>10</b> conserves more interior space for future expansion and additional functionality than conventional locks.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an individual seeks unauthorized access to the lock mechanism <b>10</b> when in the locked state, such as by inserting an incorrect key into the keyhole <b>38</b> and applying a torsional force or moment less than a predetermined maximum torsional force to the rotatable inner core <b>12</b>, the locking bar <b>26</b>, being prevented from moving downwardly away from the channel <b>40</b> by the tumbler stopping member <b>37</b>, at least partially engages the channel <b>40</b> and a projection <b>22</b>, or resilient member <b>31</b>, to prevent rotation of the inner core relative to the outer body <b>14</b>. If the applied torsional force meets or exceeds the predetermined maximum torsional force, such as by aggressive tampering of the lock mechanism <b>10</b>, the deformable projections <b>22</b> are configured to deform or collapse from the pressure being applied to them by the locking bar <b>26</b>. In implementations using resilient members <b>31</b>, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the members can be configured to substantially resist deformation, e.g., by flexing, up to the predetermined maximum torsional force, but allow deformation upon reaching or exceeding the predetermined maximum torsional force.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, deformation of the projections <b>22</b> allows the outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the locking bar <b>26</b> to move partially out of, but remain in contact with, the channel <b>40</b> and into the void created by the collapsed projection, which allows the rotatable inner core <b>12</b> to rotate slightly. The outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the locking bar <b>26</b> moves (with the rounded pivoting end <b>23</b> remaining in contact with the pivoting end <b>24</b> of the recess <b>20</b>) and the rotable inner core <b>12</b> rotates until the end <b>27</b> slides off of the support element <b>32</b> and contacts the ledge <b>45</b> of the recess <b>20</b>. With the locking bar <b>26</b> in contact with the ledge of the recess <b>20</b> and the channel <b>40</b>, any further rotation of the inner core <b>12</b> causes the channel and recess to deform slightly under pressure by the locking bar to effectively wedge the locking bar between the ledge of the recess and the channel. The bar being immovably wedged between the recess <b>20</b> and the channel <b>40</b> disables the lock mechanism <b>10</b> and prevents access, authorized or unauthorized, to the lock mechanism <b>10</b>, i.e., places the lock in an unoperable state.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once a projection <b>22</b> is deformed and the locking bar <b>26</b> is permanently wedged between the ledge <b>45</b> or upper surface of the recess <b>20</b> and the channel <b>40</b>, the lock mechanism <b>10</b> is effectively inoperable and must be replaced. Accordingly, the predetermined maximum torsional force should correspond to a level beyond the maximum torsional force an individual seeking authorized access to the lock mechanism would apply to the inner core <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In embodiments where the deformable members are one or more resilient members <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, deformation of the resilient member or members <b>31</b> allows the outer body engaging end <b>27</b> of the locking bar <b>26</b> to move in a manner similar to that described above in relation to embodiments using projections <b>22</b> except that the end <b>27</b> moves into the void created by the deformed, or flexed, resilient member <b>31</b>. The end <b>27</b> moves until it slides off of the support element <b>32</b> and contacts the ledge of the recess <b>20</b> and the channel to prevent further rotation of the inner core <b>12</b> relative to the outer body <b>14</b>. However, unlike the deformable projections <b>22</b>, the resilient members <b>31</b> in a deformed, or flexed, state can be configured to exert a biasing force on the locking bar <b>26</b> such that the bar does not cause deformation of the channel and recess. Accordingly, the lock is not rendered inoperable and the resilient members <b>31</b> move the locking bar <b>26</b> back into engagement with the channel <b>40</b> once the predetermined maximum torsional force applied to the inner core is relaxed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast, a user seeking authorized access can insert an authorized key <b>16</b> into the keyhole <b>38</b>. Upon insertion of an authorized key <b>16</b>, the tumbler stopping member <b>37</b> within the rotatable inner core <b>12</b> is moved from a position opposite the tumbler pins <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such as in the inward direction indicated by the arrow, to place the lock in an unlocked state (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). With the tumbler pins <b>30</b> unrestrained from downward movement by the tumbler stopping member <b>37</b>, the user's rotation of the key causes the plug <b>18</b> to rotate and the locking pin <b>26</b> to move downwardly as a result of its interaction with the channel <b>40</b>. Further rotation of the plug <b>18</b> urges the locking pin <b>26</b> to slide out of the channel <b>40</b> and slide along the inner surface of the outer body bore <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The user is then allowed to unobstructively rotate the inner core <b>12</b> relative to the outer body <b>14</b> to disengage a latch or other securing element coupled to the inner core and access a secured area.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the key can be an access device with one or more electrical components that communicate with and/or transfer power to the lock. In the illustrated embodiments, the key <b>16</b> is a mechanical key with an electronic memory portion <b>60</b> containing user identification information or access code information readable by a micro-processor based circuit <b>62</b> housed in the plug <b>18</b>. The circuit <b>62</b> can include a solenoid or other device (not shown), such as a motor, magnet, or other similar device. The solenoid can be selectively controllable to &#x201c;unlock the lock,&#x201d; i.e., to move or release the tumbler stopping member <b>37</b> from underneath the tumbler pins <b>30</b>, when the information read by the circuit indicates access is authorized.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, power and information transfer between the memory portion of the key and the circuit of the outer body can be initiated by inserting the key into the outer body to establish electrical contact between the memory and the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other implementations, the memory portion of the key can communicate wirelessly with the circuit of the outer body, such as, for example, via an infrared or RF communications link, to transmit information between the memory portion and the circuit. In certain implementations, the key can function to wirelessly transfer signals, information or energy to the lock to change the lock to an unlocked state when positioned near, but not in contact with the lock. Thereafter, the key is inserted into the lock and rotated to access the secured area. In other implementations, the key can be inserted into the lock to wirelessly transfer information to the lock to place the lock in an unlocked state with a user similarly rotating the key to access the secured area.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In embodiments having an access device with one or more electrical components, the device can be operated to change the lock from the unlocked state to the locked state, i.e., by moving or releasing the tumbler stopping member to a position underneath the tumblers. This can be accomplished selectively, such as by physically manipulating the key, or automatically, such as by removing the key from the lock or after a predetermined time has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the key can be a mechanical key that physically contacts and moves the tumbler stopping member <b>37</b> from underneath the tumbler pins <b>30</b> to unlock the lock mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the illustrated embodiments show one recess (with associated tumblers and locking bar) and one corresponding locking member receiving channel, it is recognized that the rotatable inner core can include more than one recess (each with associated tumblers and a locking bar) and more than one corresponding locking member receiving channel. For example, in some implementations, the rotatable inner core can have four recesses spaced an equal distance apart from each other around the core, with each recess having associated tumblers and a locking bar. The outer body can include four corresponding receiving channels within the outer body bore with each receiving a portion of one of the locking bars. Further, although two tumblers per recess are shown, it is recognized that one or more than two tumblers per recess can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the recess <b>20</b> and projections <b>22</b> are formed in the rotatable inner core plug <b>18</b> and the locking member receiving channel <b>40</b> is formed in the outer body <b>14</b> in the illustrated embodiments, it is recognized that in some implementations, the recess and projections can be formed in the outer body and the locking member receiving channel can be formed in the inner core plug. Further, other components inserted into or housed within the rotatable inner core can be inserted into or housed within the lock outer body.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Unless otherwise noted, the various components of the lock mechanism described herein can be made from a strong, rigid material such as steel. Of course, in some applications, other materials can be used, such as, but not limited to, other metals, including aluminum, brass, stainless steel, zinc, nickel and titanium.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In view of the many possible embodiments to which the described principles may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples and should not be taken as limiting in scope. Rather, the scope is defined by the following claims. We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.</p>
