<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A coupling arrangement for securing two separable components in an excavating operation includes a wear component, a base component and a lock. The lock has a body having a configuration adapted to be received in a hole in the base component, and a rotatable locking member. The locking member includes a flange that is movable between a locking position wherein the flange holds the lock in the assembly and a release position wherein the flange permits the lock to be removed from the assembly. In the release position, the flange sets within the axial extension of the outline of the body. In the locking position, at least part of the flange sets outside the axial extension of the outline of the body. In one construction, the rotation of the locking member to the locking position tightens the fit of the wear component on the base component.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to a coupling arrangement for releasably securing together two separable components. The lock is particularly suited for securing a wear member to a mount in regard to an excavating operation or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wear parts, particularly in the excavating industry, are usually composed of separable components so as to minimize the amount of material that must be replaced when the wear member becomes worn. As an example, excavating teeth are secured along the digging edge of excavating buckets to penetrate and break up the ground in advance of the bucket to improve the collection of earthen material and to protect the digging edge from premature wear. Such teeth usually comprise an adapter, a point or tip, and a lock or retainer to removably secure the point to the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An adapter is a base component that is fixed to the digging edge of an excavator by welding, mechanical attachment or being cast as an integral portion of the bucket lip. The adapter itself may have multiple parts, particularly in larger sized teeth, but is commonly a single component. In any event, the adapter includes a forwardly projecting nose as a mount for the wear member. The point has a generally wedge-shaped configuration with top and bottom walls that converge to a digging edge. The base or rear end of the point includes a rearwardly opening socket by which the point is received over the adapter nose. The lock is inserted into a passage that is collectively defined by aligned openings in the adapter nose and the point. The passage may extend through a central portion of the tooth, either vertically or horizontally, or be defined externally of the nose to receive an external lock. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,143 to Kreitzberg, U.S. Pat. No. 6,385,871 to Quarfordt, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,945 to Emrich.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As can be appreciated, excavating teeth are used often used under arduous conditions. The loads applied to the points, particularly with large mining buckets, can be very large, of various kinds, and continually shifting. It is important to maintain the lock in the defined passage during use so that the point is not lost. Loss of the point not only requires replacement of the point and causes premature wearing of the adapter, but may also damage downstream machinery intended to process the excavated material. Accordingly, the lock is usually fit tightly within the defined passage to inhibit its ejection or loss. The tight engagement can be caused by the insertion of a resilient tightening member in the passage, partially misaligned holes in the adapter and point, or close dimensioning between the holes and the lock. In the past, a large hammer has typically been needed to force the lock into and out of the passage. This tends to be an onerous and time-consuming task for the operator in the field, and exposes the worker to some risk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need in the industry for a lock that can be easily inserted into and out of the wear assembly without hammering, and yet can effectively hold the wear part in place even under severe conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention pertains to a coupling arrangement for releasably holding two separable components together. The coupling arrangement is especially suited for use in holding a wear part to a base in excavating operations. Nevertheless, the invention could be used in other environments wherein it is desired to releasably secure one member to another via a lock received into an opening defined by the joined components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the invention, a lock is adapted for installation and removal without the need for repeated hammer blows. The lock can be installed and removed on site in an easy and quick manner so as to reduce the difficulty and time typically needed to exchange a worn component with a new replacement. This is a particular advantage when the coupling arrangement is used to secure wear parts to large excavating equipment where equipment downtime translates into a significant economic loss. Further, by eliminating the need for hammering, the inventive coupling arrangement reduces the risk to which users have ordinarily been exposed in replacing wear parts in excavating operations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the inventive coupling arrangement is able to securely hold the components together even under heavy loading. A lock is used that includes a locking member movable between release and locked positions so that the lock can be positively retained in the assembly instead of relying upon the tightness of the fit. Accordingly, the lock is equally retained in the assembly irrespective of whether the components are tightly or loosely fit together. This is a particular advantage when used with parts that experience significant wearing because looseness will invariably develop as one or both of the parts become worn. In this arrangement, the lock remains in the assembly to hold the wear part or other component in place even under arduous conditions and/or the application of heavy, shifting loads&#x2014;such as may be experienced during an excavating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the lock of the coupling arrangement includes two members wherein one is movably supported by the other. The movable locking member can be shifted between a first position where it lies within the bounds of the supporting body or base member for receipt of the lock within the assembly, and a second position where it at least partially extends outside of the bounds of the base member to positively retain the lock within the assembly. In a preferred construction, the movable member sets behind a wall of the assembly in the second position to positively prevent removal or ejection of the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one such embodiment, the inventive coupling arrangement is employed to hold a wear part to a base in an excavating machine. The movable member of the lock is limited to rotational motion and is free of any loading pressure from the wear part while it is moved from one position to the other. Therefore, this member can be rotated between the release and locked positions in an easy, quick and safe procedure for coupling and uncoupling the components together.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the invention, a lock is used to secure a wear part to an adapter or other mount in an excavating machine. A body or base member of the lock is received within an opening defined in the mount. The body includes a bearing portion that sets against an edge of a hole defined in the wear part to prevent removal of the wear part from the mount. A locking member of the lock is selectively movable between locked and release positions to hold or release the lock from the assembly. In a preferred construction, the locking member rotates relative to the body, and a locking portion of the locking member is positioned axially beyond the body to minimize the required size of the opening in the wear part, in order to maximize the strength of the wear part.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a lock to hold two components together includes a body having a resilient member with an aperture and a locking component that rotates between release and locked positions. The locking member has a non-circular stem that is received into the aperture of the resilient member. The stem and aperture have corresponding non-circular shapes such that the resilient material deforms when the stem is rotated. The resilient material functions to resist unwanted movement of the locking member but permit actuation of the lock in an easy, reliable and cost-effective manner, and to provide certainty in properly setting the locking member in the release and locked positions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one other aspect, the lock comprises a locking member that not only positively retains the lock in the assembly, but also tightens the assembly of one component (e.g., the wear part) on the other (e.g., the mount). In one embodiment, the locking member includes a rotatable cam that can be selectively positioned in a release position where the lock may be inserted into the assembly and a locked position where the cam tightens the connection. Preferably, the cam further includes a portion that sets behind a wall of the assembly in the locked position to positively retain the lock in place.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one other aspect, a lock in accordance with the present invention is adapted to cooperate with a cap to shield the lock and inhibit the build up of fines around the lock. The movable locking member of the lock is provided with a head that includes structure for (i) effecting rotation of the locking member, (ii) pulling the lock from the joined components, and (iii) facilitating installation, retention and removal of the cap. In a preferred construction, the head includes flats to facilitate rotation of the locking member, a pry edge to engage a pry tool, and chamfered surfaces on the outer and inner sides of the head to enable the cap to be installed and removed from the lock. The pry tool, then, preferably includes gripping surfaces that matingly engage the inner chamfered surfaces (forming the pry edge) to pull the lock from the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the invention, a wear part (or other component) includes walls that define a socket into which is received a corresponding mount (e.g., an adapter nose). One of the walls in the wear part includes an opening through which is received a lock. The opening includes a rear edge as a bearing surface adapted to abut the lock and retain the wear part to the mount. To provide ample support to withstand the applied loads, the bearing surface encompasses a substantially full thickness of the wall in which the opening is defined. Another side of the opening, however, is defined by a reduced thickness of the wall so as to form a recess into which a portion of the lock can be set to prevent removal of the lock from the assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention pertains to a coupling arrangement <b>10</b> for releasably securing two separable components together. The invention is especially suited for holding a wear part to a base in an excavating operation. A preferred construction for the invention is an excavating tooth, although the scope of the invention is not limited to an excavating tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a tooth <b>12</b> in accordance with the present invention includes an adapter <b>14</b>, a point or tip <b>16</b> and a lock or retainer <b>18</b>. The invention in this application is at times described in relative terms, such as &#x201c;up&#x201d; and &#x201c;down,&#x201d; for ease of explanation. These terms generally are to be understood in relation to the orientation of the wear assembly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the wear assembly can be placed in all kinds of orientations, and the relative terms used to describe the invention are not intended to be a limitation of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Adapter <b>14</b>, as illustrated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), includes a forwardly projecting nose <b>20</b> and a pair of bifurcated legs <b>22</b> adapted to receive the lip of an excavating bucket (not shown). The legs are adapted to be secured by mechanical means (e.g., by a Whisler style connection), but could also be welded or cast as part of the lip. The adapter could also be composed of multiple parts secured together by a lock or the like, especially in larger sized teeth. In any event, nose <b>20</b> typically projects forward to define a mount for point <b>16</b> (although the nose could be on the point and the socket defined in the adapter). Nose <b>20</b> could be formed to have a wide variety of configurations to meet the needs of the intended usage and/or other factors. As one example, the nose is formed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,043 to Jones et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the preferred construction, nose <b>20</b> includes a pair of converging surfaces <b>24</b> and a pair of sidewalls <b>28</b>. A pocket <b>32</b> is formed in one of the sidewalls for receiving lock <b>18</b>. Pocket <b>32</b> has a shape that substantially corresponds to the shape of the lock, and preferably has a non-circular configuration that narrows as it extends toward the front end of the nose. A non-circular shape is preferred to prevent the lock from turning during use. Pocket <b>32</b> is defined by a perimeter wall <b>34</b> and an inner wall <b>36</b>. Alternatively, a pocket could be formed in each sidewall <b>28</b> to allow for installation of lock <b>18</b> on either side of the tooth or for using a lock on each side.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Point <b>16</b> includes a forwardly projecting digging end <b>38</b> and a rear mounting end <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The mounting end has a rearwardly opening socket <b>42</b> to receive nose <b>20</b> therein. The socket is generally defined by converging walls <b>44</b> and sidewalls <b>48</b>. The inner configuration of the socket is adapted to match the shape of the nose, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,043. A hole <b>52</b> is preferably formed in both sidewalls <b>48</b> so that the point can be reversibly mounted on the adapter for even wearing and longer life. Nevertheless, a single hole <b>52</b> in one sidewall <b>48</b> could be provided for a non-reversible point. Hole <b>52</b> is defined by a peripheral edge <b>54</b> and preferably has an outer configuration (i.e., as seen from outside the point), similar to the shape of pocket <b>32</b>, to receive lock <b>18</b>. While other shapes for hole <b>52</b> could be used, matching the shape of a uniquely shaped lock is preferred to ensure that the lock will be properly oriented when installed in the tooth. Alternatively, the shape of pocket <b>32</b> could be relied upon to prevent improper insertion of the lock if hole <b>52</b> is shaped and/or sized to permit insertion of the lock in multiple orientations. The peripheral edge <b>54</b> defines a recess <b>56</b> along a lower portion of hole <b>52</b> to receive a part of lock <b>18</b>, as discussed below. While the recess could be formed along other portions of the peripheral edge <b>54</b> (or with multiple recesses), it is preferably not formed along the rear wall portion <b>58</b> of hole <b>52</b>. The rear wall portion <b>58</b> spans substantially the full thickness of sidewall <b>48</b> to define a bearing surface to abut the lock and retain the point on the adapter even under heavy loading.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Lock <b>18</b> preferably includes two primary components&#x2014;namely, a body or base member <b>60</b> and a locking member <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-15</figref>). Body <b>60</b> preferably comprises a rigid retaining member <b>63</b> and a resilient member <b>64</b>. Locking member <b>62</b> is mounted to body <b>60</b> for movement between a release position wherein the lock can be installed into or removed from the tooth (or other assembly), and a locked position wherein the lock is retained in the tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a preferred construction, retaining member <b>63</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13</figref>) has a base <b>66</b> formed with a configuration to substantially match the shape of pocket <b>32</b> in nose <b>20</b>. The base is a hollow structure defining a cavity <b>68</b>, which has a generally D-shaped configuration that includes flat peripheral surfaces <b>70</b> and an inner surface <b>71</b>. A rim <b>72</b> is provided on an outer side of base <b>66</b>. Rim <b>72</b> extends forward and rearward of base <b>66</b> to define locator faces <b>74</b> that are adapted to abut sidewall <b>28</b> of nose <b>20</b> and thereby properly locate the lock in pocket <b>32</b>. The rear portion <b>72</b><i>a </i>of rim <b>72</b> is preferably enlarged to provide an ample bearing surface to abut against rear wall portion <b>58</b> of point <b>16</b> and thereby retain the point on the adapter. Also, as described below, rear portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>of base <b>66</b> has a longer extension than front portion <b>66</b><i>b </i>to provide sufficient resistance for the expected applied loads. Retaining member <b>63</b> preferably has a central, shallow depression <b>75</b> for receiving a projection <b>77</b> of locking member <b>62</b> along a front side. This depression is provided to lessen the extension of head <b>106</b> and minimize the overall length of the lock. The depression is preferably formed by the provisions of raised stops <b>81</b>, <b>83</b> on the front or outer face of the retaining member&#x2014;with one stop <b>81</b> extending along the top of the depression and one stop <b>83</b> extending along the front of the depression. A bore <b>85</b> connects depression <b>75</b> and cavity <b>68</b>. Bore <b>85</b> permits locking member <b>62</b> to extend through retaining member <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Resilient member <b>64</b> is preferably formed as a one-piece elastomer formed of rubber of the like (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Resilient member <b>64</b> is fit within cavity <b>68</b> and thus has an outer surface <b>86</b> shaped to generally match the interior walls of the cavity. The flat surfaces <b>70</b> prevent any turning of resilient member <b>64</b> in the retaining member, although other arrangements could be used. Resilient member <b>64</b> sets against inner wall <b>71</b> and includes an axial passage <b>88</b> having a square or other non-circular cross sectional configuration. Axial passage <b>88</b> is aligned with bore <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Locking member <b>62</b> is preferably a rigid, unitary member having a stem <b>90</b> that is received through bore <b>85</b> in retaining member <b>63</b> and axial passage <b>88</b> in resilient member <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>). Stem <b>90</b> is longer than body <b>60</b> so that it extends inward beyond resilient member <b>64</b>. In the preferred construction, a collar <b>92</b> is fixed to the stem by a roll pin (not shown) passed into holes <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>. However, other means could be used to fix the collar to the stem or to replace the collar in holding the body and locking member together. The resilient member is trapped between collar <b>92</b> and inner surface <b>71</b>. Stem <b>90</b> preferably has a shank portion <b>97</b> having a square cross section along most of its length to match the shape of axial passage <b>88</b>, however, other non-circular shapes could be used. Stem <b>90</b> also includes a circular portion <b>99</b> to closely fit in bore <b>85</b> for stabilizing locking member <b>62</b> relative to retaining member <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Projection <b>77</b> is fixed to stem <b>90</b> and, in cooperation with collar <b>92</b>, secures locking member <b>62</b> to body <b>60</b>. Projection <b>77</b> sets in depression <b>75</b>, although it could simply set in front of retaining member <b>63</b> (i.e., without the depression). A flange or tab <b>104</b> extends beyond <b>77</b> along one of its sides, which, as described below, functions to retain lock <b>18</b> in tooth <b>12</b>. Alternatively, a plurality of flanges or the like could also be used to secure the lock in place. Stem <b>90</b> terminates in a head <b>106</b> that includes flats <b>107</b> or other means to facilitate rotation of locking member <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In use, point <b>16</b> is placed onto nose <b>20</b> of adapter <b>14</b> such that one of holes <b>52</b> aligns with pocket <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Lock <b>18</b> is then manually placed through hole <b>52</b> and into pocket <b>32</b>. No hammering is necessary, though one may be used if desired to set the lock in place. The lock is inserted into pocket <b>32</b> until locator faces <b>74</b> abut sidewall <b>28</b>. This positioning places the lock sufficiently inside of the exterior of the wear part <b>16</b> so that it is protected during the abrasive digging process. When the lock is installed, projection <b>77</b> is oriented in its release position such that flange <b>104</b> is positioned generally rearward. In this release position, flange <b>104</b> is within the bounds or peripheral cross sectional shape of body <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref>). Once lock <b>18</b> is fully inserted into pocket <b>32</b>, a wrench or the like (not shown) is used to rotate locking member <b>62</b> clockwise to the locked position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</figref>). This rotation causes flange <b>104</b> to move outside of the bounds of body <b>60</b> and into recess <b>56</b> in point <b>16</b> such that extension <b>104</b> sets behind ledge portion <b>108</b> of sidewall <b>28</b>. This arrangement positively holds the lock in the tooth without relying on the holding force of a resilient member subjected to loading or the tightness of fitting the lock into the tooth. While resilient member <b>64</b> inhibits turning of the locking member, as described below, it is not subjected to loading from the wear part during use. With the locking member in the locked position, the lock cannot be removed from tooth <b>12</b> even if the point and/or adapter are worn and loosely fit together.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, with the lock in place, the rear bearing portion <b>72</b><i>a </i>of rim <b>72</b> opposes the rear wall portion <b>58</b> of hole <b>52</b> in point <b>16</b> to prevent removal of the point from the adapter nose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). With the application of forward pressure on the point, the rear wall portion of hole <b>52</b> presses against rim <b>72</b>. The front portion <b>66</b><i>b </i>of retaining member <b>63</b>, then, abuts against the front portion <b>110</b> of pocket <b>32</b>. Since this pressure is applied along the outer sections of lock <b>18</b>, a moment is also applied to the lock tending to urge the lock to rotate about a vertical axis (not shown). This motion is resisted by the elongate rear portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>of base <b>66</b> abutting the rear portion <b>112</b> of pocket <b>32</b> and the front locator face <b>74</b> abutting sidewall <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Rotation of locking member <b>62</b> is resisted by the square shank portion <b>97</b> being received within the square passage <b>88</b> of resilient member <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). When the user rotates the locking member, the corners of shank portion <b>97</b> stretch the sidewalls of passage <b>88</b>. While the resilient member is prefereably closely received in retaining member <b>63</b> with clearance for stretching being provided into the pocket, clearance may be provided between resilient member <b>64</b> and retaining member <b>63</b> to provide additional space for stretching of the material. Alternatively, the resilient member is composed of a compressible foam or the like. As the square shank portion <b>97</b> passes the over-center position, the resilient member urges the completion of a 90 degree rotation of the locking member, i.e., until the shank portion is again matingly received within passage <b>88</b>. The square passage, then, tends to resist movement of the flange past the locked position or release position. Stops <b>81</b>, <b>83</b> function to prevent rotation of the locking member in the wrong direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>12</b>). For instance, in the locked position, stop <b>83</b> prevents any further clockwise movement. In the release position, stop <b>81</b> prevents any further counter-clockwise movement of the locking member.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If soil is of a loose, non-packing nature, the lock can usually be pulled from the assembly by hand. When soil is of a nature that packs, or even cements, the lock is preferably pried out of pocket <b>32</b> when the point needs to be removed from the adapter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). In a preferred construction, a pry relief <b>115</b> is formed on opposite sides of head <b>106</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the relief is a shallow depression bounded by a peripheral edge <b>117</b> except along one side <b>117</b><i>a</i>, which is open. The outer segment defines a pry edge <b>117</b><i>b </i>against which a pry tool engages the lock to pull the lock from the tooth. The pry edge <b>117</b><i>b </i>is a ramp surface at an angle of about 125 degrees to the floor <b>117</b><i>d </i>of the relief to hold cap in place but still permit removal of the cap when needed, although pry edge <b>117</b><i>b </i>could be varied and set at a wide range of angles.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A preferred pry tool <b>121</b> includes a lever <b>123</b>, a fulcrum <b>125</b> on one end of the lever, and a pair of prying arms <b>127</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>). The arms each include a finger <b>129</b> that is directed inward so that they point toward each other. Each finger includes a gripping surface <b>137</b> at an angle of about 125 degrees relative to the inner surface <b>138</b> of arms <b>127</b> to match the angle of pry edge <b>117</b><i>b</i>, although gripping surface <b>137</b> could be varied and set at a wide range of angles. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, open side <b>117</b><i>a </i>opens upwardly when locking member <b>62</b> is in the release position for removal of the lock. In use, fingers <b>129</b> are lowered into relief <b>115</b> via open side <b>117</b><i>a</i>, i.e., until they abut edge portion <b>117</b><i>c</i>. Fulcrum <b>125</b> is set against a lower part of point <b>16</b> and lever <b>123</b> is forced outward by the user. Gripping surfaces <b>137</b> on fingers <b>129</b> matingly engage pry edge <b>117</b><i>b </i>to pull the lock outwardly until the lock is fully removed from the tooth. Once lock <b>18</b> clears hole <b>52</b>, the weight distribution of the lock swings the body downward such that the fingers continue to engage and hold edge <b>117</b><i>c </i>to temporarily hold the lock for the user to grasp. The lock can, then, be removed by manually sliding fingers <b>129</b> through open side <b>117</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As noted above, if desired, a rubber or other elastomeric cap <b>133</b> can be fit within hole <b>52</b> to cover the hole and prevent the build up fines around the lock. Preferably cap <b>133</b> includes a recess <b>135</b> that generally matches the shape of head <b>106</b>. The receipt of head <b>106</b> in recess <b>135</b> firmly holds the cap in place. The cap is fully recessed within hole <b>52</b> so that it is shielded from various forces that may tend to eject it.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Head <b>106</b> is preferably formed to facilitate rotation of the locking member, prying of the lock, and installation and removal of a cap <b>133</b> adapted to plug hole <b>52</b> and inhibit the build up of fines around the lock during use. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the head is formed with a hexagonal exterior (although other shapes could be used) to provide flats <b>134</b> for the engagement of a wrench (not shown). Chamfered surfaces <b>136</b> are provided adjacent two opposing flats <b>134</b> to enable the walls of the recess <b>135</b> in cap <b>133</b> to be received over the head to hold the cap in place (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a second embodiment of the present invention, a lock <b>218</b> is used to secure a point <b>216</b> to an adapter <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-32</figref>). In this embodiment, the lock applies a tightening force on the assembly as well as being installed without hammering and positively holding the lock in the tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Adapter <b>214</b> includes a nose <b>220</b> provided with a pocket <b>232</b> in one sidewall <b>228</b> for receiving lock <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). The pocket has a non-circular shape that narrows toward the front end, although other shapes could be used. Unlike adapter <b>14</b>, adapter <b>214</b> includes a rib <b>225</b> that extends outward of sidewall <b>228</b> in front of pocket <b>232</b>. Rib <b>225</b> has a tapered configuration that expands rearward to define a bearing face <b>226</b> for lock <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Point <b>216</b> has a socket <b>242</b> into which is received nose <b>220</b>, and holes <b>252</b> in sidewalls <b>248</b> to receive lock <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Holes <b>252</b> each has a configuration to generally match the shape of the lock. The rear end of each hole <b>252</b> is vertically enlarged to receive the locking flange <b>304</b> extending from cam <b>277</b>. The enlarged portion <b>252</b><i>a </i>ensures the user will properly insert the lock into the tooth. In order to accommodate rib <b>225</b>, the interior surface <b>245</b> of each sidewall <b>248</b> includes a longitudinal channel <b>246</b> that extends from the rear end of the point to a position in front of hole <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a preferred construction, lock <b>218</b> includes a body <b>260</b> and a locking member <b>262</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-32</figref>). Locking member <b>262</b> is rotatably mounted within body <b>260</b> for movement between release and locked positions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Body <b>260</b> comprises a resilient member <b>264</b> (composed of rubber or the like), which is bonded to a rigid retaining member <b>263</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-32</figref>). The retaining member, in this embodiment, is a rear bearing member having a generally flat configuration. The resilient member has a block shape with a central passage <b>288</b> passing therethrough. In the preferred construction, the resilient member has a broadly curved front portion <b>264</b><i>a</i>, preferably along a generally circular arc), and generally flat surfaces <b>264</b><i>b</i>, <b>264</b><i>c</i>. These flat surfaces help prevent the body from turning when the locking member is rotated. Central passage <b>288</b> preferably has a square shaped (or other non-circular) cross section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). Resilient member <b>264</b> and retaining member <b>263</b> are bonded together by adhesive, being molded together, or other means. The ends <b>263</b><i>c</i>, <b>263</b><i>d </i>of retaining member <b>263</b> also help the body from turning when the locking member is rotated, in cooperation with the flat surfaces <b>264</b><i>b</i>, <b>264</b><i>c </i>of resilient member <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Locking member <b>262</b> includes a stem <b>290</b>, a cam <b>277</b>, a flange or tab <b>304</b>, and a head <b>306</b>. As with lock <b>18</b>, stem <b>290</b> includes a shank portion <b>297</b> with a generally square cross section (or other non-circular shape) that is received in a square shaped passage <b>288</b>. The square shank in the square passage operates as discussed above for lock <b>18</b>. A collar <b>292</b> is preferably attached to the free end of stem <b>290</b> to secure locking member <b>262</b> to body <b>260</b>. Collar <b>292</b> is preferably secured in place through the use of a roll pin inserted into aligned holes in the collar and stem. Alternatively, the collar could be replaced with a clip <b>291</b> and washer <b>293</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. In this embodiment, a clip <b>292</b> snaps onto stem <b>290</b> to trap resilient member <b>264</b> between clip <b>292</b> and frame member <b>267</b>. The washer <b>293</b> is preferably placed between clip <b>292</b> and resilient member <b>264</b>. Of course, other arrangements could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Cam <b>277</b> is fixed to stem <b>290</b> and has a generally oblong shape. Flange <b>304</b> extends radially outward from the one side of cam <b>277</b> between ends <b>305</b>, <b>307</b>. Although flange <b>304</b> is illustrated with an elongate, arcuate shape, other shapes are possible. Head <b>306</b> has essentially the same shape as head <b>106</b> including flats and relief <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In use, lock <b>218</b> is placed through hole <b>252</b> and into pocket <b>232</b> when locking member <b>262</b> is in its release position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). In the release position, lock <b>218</b> has a width A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>). The lock is inserted into pocket <b>232</b> until the distal end <b>320</b> of stem <b>290</b> contacts the inner surface <b>322</b> of pocket <b>232</b>. In this position, the outer portion <b>324</b> of retaining member <b>263</b> opposes the rear wall portion <b>258</b> of hole <b>252</b>. However, because of channel <b>246</b>, rear wall portion <b>258</b> defines two spaced apart bearing faces <b>258</b><i>a</i>, <b>258</b><i>b </i>to each side of channel <b>246</b> that abut bearing points <b>263</b><i>a</i>, <b>263</b><i>b </i>on retaining member <b>263</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 24</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once the lock is properly positioned, locking member <b>262</b> is rotated, preferably by engaging head <b>306</b> with a wrench (not shown). Cam <b>277</b> rotates such that end <b>305</b> presses against bearing face <b>226</b> to push the lock rearward. The pressure applied by cam <b>277</b> when rotated such that end <b>305</b> bears against rib <b>325</b> compresses resilient member <b>264</b> against retaining member <b>263</b>. This rearward shifting of lock <b>218</b>, in turn, pushes point <b>216</b> farther onto nose <b>220</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-30</figref>, lock <b>218</b> in the locked position has a width B, which is larger than width A. This increase in width generates a tightening function on the tooth assembly. Also, in the locked position, as with lock <b>18</b>, flange <b>304</b> is rotated into recess <b>256</b> behind ledge <b>308</b> to positively retain lock <b>218</b> in pocket <b>232</b> and thereby prevent unwanted ejection of the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the lock is to be removed from the tooth or other assembly, cam <b>277</b> is rotated counterclockwise to the release position. Although the use of a cap <b>333</b> is usually effective to keep fines from building up around head <b>306</b>, fines are often forced into hole <b>252</b> around the cap so as to accumulate in every available opening. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, cam <b>277</b> is aligned with outer portion <b>324</b> of retaining member <b>263</b>. Accordingly, a small gap exists between end <b>307</b> and the front surface of retaining member <b>263</b>. Since this gap will usually compact with fines, the bottom half of the periphery of cam <b>277</b> extending between <b>305</b> and <b>397</b> (behind flange <b>304</b>) preferably conforms to a substantially circular arc to avoid resistance caused by fines in the gap. The upper half of the periphery of the cam between ends <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> (which faces forward in the release position) preferably conforms to a substantially elliptical arc to effect the camming function as the cam is rotated (i.e., effects the different widths A and B) Nevertheless, other shapes are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To minimize the creation of moments within the lock, the rotational center of cam <b>277</b> is preferably aligned with bearing face <b>226</b> of nose <b>220</b>, outer bearing portion <b>324</b> of retaining member <b>263</b> and rear wall portion <b>258</b> of point <b>216</b>. Moreover, this alignment of cam <b>277</b> with the outer portion <b>324</b> of retaining member <b>263</b> enables the retaining member to act as a backstop to the movement of the cam when resilient member <b>264</b> deforms significantly under heavy side loading.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">These and other embodiments in accordance with the present invention can be used in conjunction with excavating teeth, other wear members, or other separable components. The described embodiments are intended to be illustrative and not limiting of the scope of the invention.</p>
