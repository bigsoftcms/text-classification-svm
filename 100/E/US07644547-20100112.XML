<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority to and all advantages of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/683,448 which was filed on May 23, 2005.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject invention generally relates to exterior sills and more particularly to extruded window sills.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Windows, doors and other openings in exterior structures or walls of buildings are known to have sills or thresholds designed to seal inclement weather out and generally shed water away from the window or opening and prevent moisture ingress between structure underlayment or sheathing and the exterior siding or veneer of the building. Unfortunately, known sills that are made of wood can rot and peel paint over the years, and stone sills are expensive and difficult to install. Both wood and stone sills typically require caulking to prevent water seepage into the structure. Moreover, this caulking requires continual maintenance to reseal old chalk that has cracked or loosened.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An exterior sill assembly preferably for a window has a preferably extruded body, and attachable facial and preferable end caps for covering open ends of a cavity defined in-part by the body. The body has a substantially vertical flange for mounting to a structure preferably below a window frame. A sill projects outward from the flange to a distal portion, and preferably a support plate spaced below the sill projects outward from the flange to a distal segment. Releasable attachment features are carried between the facial, the distal portion and the distal segment for engagement of the facial to the body. Fasteners disposed in-part in the cavity extend through the flange for engagement into the structure. Preferably, the fasteners are used in conjunction with respective members for distributing stress loads across the flange.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, an upper attachment feature is carried between the longitudinally extending distal portion of the sill and an upper edge of the facial and is orientated in such a way that the facial is slightly recessed from a drip edge of the sill that is carried by the distal portion. A lower attachment feature is carried between the longitudinally extending distal segment of the support plate and the facial providing structural support for the sill.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Features, advantages and benefits of the present invention include a maintenance free sill assembly that is easy to install, has improved sealing and water shedding capability, and is relatively inexpensive. Moreover, the sill assembly is robust, relatively simple in design, and in-service has a maintenance-free and long and useful life.</p>

The body <b>22</b> and facial <b>24</b> are produced in sellable and shippable lengths that are preferably cut to a measured length at the job site to fit the particular window or opening. The width of the body <b>22</b> or that portion projecting away from the structure is preferably sufficient to extend beyond the exterior siding or veneers of the building. Securing the body <b>22</b> to the structure located beneath the window are a plurality of fasteners <b>30</b> that are preferably threaded screws and a respective plurality of stress distribution members <b>32</b> engaged generally between an enlarged head <b>34</b> of the fasteners <b>30</b> and a substantially vertical flange <b>36</b> of the body <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The flange <b>36</b> of the body <b>22</b> is preferably elongated in a horizontal direction and spans laterally in a vertical direction. The flange <b>36</b> has a base or mid portion <b>38</b>, a top portion <b>40</b>, and a bottom portion <b>42</b>. Each portion <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> has a horizontal row of a plurality of apertures or slots <b>44</b> for selective receipt of the fasteners <b>30</b>. Preferably, the top and bottom portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are engaged to the mid portion <b>38</b> via respective living hinges or furrows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. The furrows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> create greater flexibility in the flange <b>36</b> for conforming to irregularities in the vertical structure and/or for quick removal of the top and/or bottom portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> from the body <b>22</b> via a repetitious folding of the flange <b>36</b> along either of the furrows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> until the fatigued material breaks or by a saw or blade cut made along the furrows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An elongated sill <b>50</b> projects laterally outward from the mid portion <b>38</b> of the flange <b>36</b> just below the top furrow <b>46</b> of the flange <b>36</b>. As the sill <b>50</b> projects forward it also slopes downward to a distal portion <b>52</b> that preferably releasably engages the facial <b>24</b>. Also projecting laterally outward from the mid portion <b>38</b>, preferably immediately above the furrow <b>48</b> and spaced below the sill <b>50</b> is a support bracket or elongated plate <b>54</b>. The plate <b>54</b> co-extends longitudinally with the flange <b>36</b> and the sill <b>50</b>, and projects laterally outward to a distal segment <b>56</b> that preferably snap fits to the facial <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, carried preferably between the distal portion <b>52</b> of the sloping sill <b>50</b> and a longitudinal upper edge <b>58</b> of the facial <b>24</b> is a swing joint or upper fastening feature <b>60</b>. Feature <b>60</b> preferably has an arm <b>62</b> projecting downward from the distal portion <b>52</b> of the sill <b>50</b> to an enlarged head <b>64</b> that projects forward and away from the structure. The head <b>64</b> carries a substantially horizontal stop face <b>66</b> that faces upward and a sloped face <b>68</b> that faces forward and downward. A longitudinal upper edge <b>58</b> of the facial <b>24</b> supports a catch <b>72</b> of the feature <b>60</b> that projects inward with respect to the structure. The catch <b>72</b> carries a downward facing stop surface <b>74</b> and a slope surface <b>76</b> that faces inward and upward. During assembly of the facial <b>24</b> to the body <b>22</b>, sliding contact of the sloped face <b>68</b> and the sloped surface <b>76</b> guide the catch <b>72</b> preferably into a snap fit arrangement over the stop face <b>66</b>. When assembled, the stop face <b>66</b> supported by the sill <b>50</b> is in contact with the stop surface <b>74</b> supported by the facial <b>24</b> thus substantially preventing vertical movement. The feature <b>60</b> also has an elongated rib <b>78</b> supported by the distal portion <b>52</b>, spaced forward of the arm <b>62</b> and head <b>64</b>, and projecting laterally downward for preventing forward or releasing movement of the facial <b>24</b> once assembled. The rib <b>78</b> also carries a rounded drip edge <b>80</b> of the sill <b>50</b> for shedding of water outward from the facial <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Carried preferably between the distal segment <b>56</b> of the support plate <b>54</b> and a longitudinal lower edge <b>82</b> of the facial <b>24</b> is a snap fitting attachment feature <b>84</b>. Feature <b>84</b> preferably has a first or top leg <b>86</b> projecting inward from the proximity of the lower edge <b>82</b> and a second or bottom leg <b>88</b> spaced below the top leg <b>86</b> by a distance substantially equal to the thickness of the distal segment <b>56</b> of the support plate <b>54</b>. Preferably a rounded protrusion <b>90</b> projects downward from the top leg <b>86</b> for a snap fit into a recess <b>92</b> in the distal segment <b>56</b> that is open upward. One skilled in the art would now know that the recess <b>92</b> and protrusion <b>90</b> can be interchanged for the same snap fit effect. Moreover, the protrusion <b>90</b> can be located on the bottom leg <b>88</b> with the recess <b>92</b> opened downward. One skilled in the art would also now know that the fastening feature <b>60</b> and the fastening feature <b>84</b> can be interchanged although the configuration illustrated is the preferred for purposes of shedding water from the sill <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>9</b>, the stress distribution member <b>32</b> has a base portion <b>94</b>, at least three projecting legs <b>96</b> (preferably four legs as illustrated), and a hole <b>98</b> in the base portion <b>94</b>. The four legs <b>96</b> are spaced circumferentially from one-another and about the hole <b>98</b>, and project inward from the base portion <b>94</b> for compressive contact with the mid portion <b>38</b> of the flange <b>36</b> when the fasteners <b>30</b> are tightened against the base portion <b>94</b>. The hole <b>98</b> is centered in the member <b>32</b> for receipt of a threaded shank <b>99</b> projecting inward from the enlarged head <b>34</b> of the fastener <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, a resiliently flexible and elongated seal or gasket <b>100</b> co-extends longitudinally with the sill <b>50</b>. The seal <b>100</b> projects upward and preferably outward from the sill <b>50</b> substantially near the furrow <b>46</b> for sealing preferably against an underside of a window casement. During manufacturing of the sill assembly <b>20</b>, the seal <b>100</b> is preferably co-extruded with the body <b>22</b>. While it is anticipated that the present invention could be made from metal in a stamping or extrusion process, the present invention in its preferred embodiment is intended to be molded or extruded from plastic. The flexible sealing gasket <b>100</b> is molded in an upward pointing direction as shown but can be easily compressed to fit tightly to the building component above it, creating a good weather resistant seal. This sealing gasket <b>100</b> will be particularly useful in cases where the sill assembly <b>20</b> is to be installed underneath an existing window sash where water intrusion is likely to occur. Caulking between the top surface of sill <b>50</b> and the building component above it could provide an additional seal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During installation of the sill assembly <b>20</b>, the body <b>22</b> and the facial <b>24</b> are first cut to length for a snug fit into the available opening area of the building. If surrounding structure dictates, the top and bottom portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the flange <b>36</b> are quickly and conveniently removed. The body <b>22</b> is then inserted into the opening until flange contact is made with the vertical structure generally located beneath the window. In some applications, the body <b>22</b> is also forced upward to bias the seal <b>100</b> against the underside of the window casement. The fasteners <b>30</b> are then generally coupled with the respective stress distribution members <b>32</b>, are inserted through selective slots <b>44</b> in the mid portion <b>38</b>, and are screwed into the vertical structure generally beneath the building opening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that reference numerals are utilized merely for convenience and are not to be limiting in any way, and that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
