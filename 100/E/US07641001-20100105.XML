<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to tools, and more particularly to earth-drilling augers used for boring through particulate material, such as soil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Forming a hole in particulate material, such as soil or sand, especially under a surface structure, such as a sidewalk or a building foundation, is commonly effected by a screw-like tool called an auger, which progressively bores or drills into the material. The typical auger has a cutting blade at the distal end of a helical flight that is mounted to an axle. The axle extends longitudinally away from the user, or a rotatable machine, and defines an axis of rotation for the auger's flights. The user rotates the auger, either by hand, or more preferably by machine, such as a drill. As the auger rotates, it removes particulate to form a hole, and conveys the particulate away from the hole by the action of the flights. The auger progressively forms the hole deeper and deeper as it cuts further and conveys particulate away. In some prior art references, additional sections of helically flighted axles can be coupled to the auger.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some prior art augers and drilling tools that are designed for drilling into compacted earth, such as clay, combine pressurized air and working fluid with the auger for continuously loosening debris from the hole. The fluid and debris are channeled into an escape route sub-assembly system, which is typically a longitudinal hole through the axle. In this way, the hole is regularly flushed and kept relatively clean to enable the inner surface of the hole to be dissociated by the drilling action. However, such prior art drilling tools are bulky and awkward due to the attached pneumatic and hydraulic hoses. Thus, such devices are difficult to maneuver and operate, especially when they are used in narrow spaces. In addition, the escape route sub-assembly system can become clogged with debris, which can damage the tool and delay the progress. Also, fluid can leak from the escape route and soak the surrounding earth, and surface structures can be damaged by, or lose support from, that surrounding earth.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some augers have been made with various types of fasteners for linking flighted modular sections together in series in order to bore a hole to a certain depth. Augers have also been formed with various cutting blades designed for enhancing the performance of the auger. For example, augers have been designed to be compact and portable in order to be transported and used to drill a hole in ice for ice fishing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A more significant design in prior art augers involves a limitation to the distance that a helical flight extends along an axle. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,221,680 to Parrish teaches an auger having a discontinuous flight attached to the outer surface of the drilling axle. Sections of the flight have been removed from the drilling stem in order to reduce friction that is generated by the rotating land, which is the peripheral edge of the flight, contacting the newly formed sidewall of the hole. The frictional force resisting the rotation of the auger is reduced along the auger.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The prior art augers are not completely satisfactory for hole-forming operations, especially where the hole is to be substantially horizontal. An auger is needed with features designed to overcome the deficiencies that have been described.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An improved boring tool is disclosed having an axle with an outer surface to which a radially inwardly facing edge of a helical flight is attached. An axle shaft is mounted at a first end of the axle for drivingly linking the axle to a portable rotatable machine, such as a drill. A shaft-receiving bore is formed at a second, opposite axle end to receive a shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The improvement comprises a nose removably mounted at the second axle end. The nose comprises a multiple-sided nose shaft, such as a hexagonal shaft, extending into the shaft-receiving bore. The shaft-receiving bore has a complementary, multiple-sided sidewall for engaging the nose shaft, thereby drivingly linking the nose to the axle. A shaft-receiving bore that is hexagonally-shaped is complementary where the nose shaft is also hexagonally shaped. A cutting tip that has at least one blade is mounted to the nose shaft to first encounter the cutting medium.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A flight cutter is removably mounted to the nose shaft. The flight cutter has at least one blade, and preferably has two opposing blades. One of the blades aligns with a leading edge of the flight, thereby forming a cutting edge near one end of the flight. The flight cutter bears the majority of the wear of cutting, and is replaceable, thereby making maintenance relatively easy. The flight cutter preferably has an aperture formed between its two blades, and the aperture has a multiple-sided sidewall, such as a hexagonal sidewall, that engages the nose shaft sides, thereby drivingly linking the flight cutter to the nose shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The tool preferably has a fastener, such as a screw, extending through the axle into the shaft-receiving bore and seating against the nose shaft, thereby retaining the nose shaft in the shaft-receiving bore. Other fasteners can be used and are contemplated. The tool preferably has electrical insulating means in the nose for electrically insulating the axle from the cutting tip and the flight cutter. Such insulating means protects the operator in case an electrical line is struck while boring.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is contemplated that multiple sections of the tool will be attached together in modular fashion in order to make the tool as long as necessary. This can occur due to the fact that all shaft-receiving bores, and all shafts, are designed to be of complementary shape and size. Thus, all shafts can fit into all bores, and all fasteners can fasten the structure in which the bore is formed to the shaft.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In describing the preferred embodiment of the invention which is illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to the specific term so selected and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. For example, the word connected or term similar thereto are often used. They are not limited to direct connection, but include connection through other elements where such connection is recognized as being equivalent by those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The auger tool <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is for boring into soil or any other particulate material through which a passage needs to be formed and which can be cut by the tool. The tool <b>10</b> has an axle <b>20</b> around which a helical flight <b>14</b> is mounted, preferably by welding at the radially inwardly facing edge <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The axle <b>20</b> is preferably a hollow tube having a first end <b>22</b>, a second end <b>24</b>, and a longitudinal axis that defines an axis of rotation, about which the tool <b>10</b> can be rotated in a hole-forming operation described below. The tool <b>10</b> and its components are made of steel or similar material commonly used for making construction tools, unless otherwise noted. It is preferred that the axle <b>20</b> is a length that has a relationship to the pitch of the helical flights, thereby causing the flight ends at the ends of the axle to align circumferentially. Thus, looking down the end of the axle <b>20</b>, the two opposite ends of the flight <b>14</b> preferably begin and end at the same circumferential point, such as the 12 o'clock point when looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second end <b>24</b> of the axle <b>20</b> has an axle shaft <b>30</b> rigidly mounted thereto, such as by welding or press fitting the shaft <b>30</b> into the inner bore of the axle <b>20</b>. The shaft <b>30</b> is a multiple sided structure, preferably a three, four, six or eight sided shaft, most preferably a six sided hexagonal shaft, that can be drivingly linked to a portable rotatable machine, such as an industrial drill (not shown), through a drive fitting <b>100</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which is configured to be mounted in the drill's &#x201c;chuck&#x201d; or clamping mechanism. The chuck of such a drill receives the shaft <b>130</b> in a conventional manner by tightening against it, thereby gripping the shaft <b>130</b> tightly. The shaft <b>30</b> of the axle is inserted into the shaft-receiving bore <b>106</b> at the opposite end of the fitting <b>100</b>, and fixes thereto, such as by spring-loaded fasteners that seat against the shaft <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A nose <b>40</b> is mounted to the first end of the axle <b>20</b>, opposite the shaft <b>30</b>. The nose <b>40</b> has a cutting tip <b>42</b>, a flight cutter <b>60</b> and a shaft <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The cutting tip <b>42</b> is similar to a conventional router bit having a blade <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) at one end and a cutting tip shaft <b>41</b> extending out of the opposite end. The shaft <b>41</b> is preferably also a multiple-sided shaft, such as a hexagonal shaft, that extends into the housing <b>50</b> as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The housing <b>50</b> is preferably a cylinder having a passage formed through it in which an insulating insert <b>52</b> is mounted. A bore is formed in the insert <b>52</b> that has a shape on its inwardly facing surface that is complementary to the shape of the outwardly facing surface of the cutting tip shaft <b>41</b>, which is mounted in the bore. An insulating pin <b>54</b> extends through the housing <b>50</b> and an insulating insert <b>52</b> and extends either against or through the shaft <b>41</b>, thereby inhibiting longitudinal movement of the shaft <b>41</b> relative to the insert <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An insulating plate <b>56</b> extends across the passage formed inside the housing <b>50</b> in which the insert <b>52</b> is mounted, and across the bore of the insert <b>52</b>. The plate <b>56</b> is preferably a circular body that is flat, similar to a coin, and has electrical insulating properties. The shaft <b>46</b> extends into the bore of the insert <b>52</b>, and is restricted from moving longitudinally by the plate <b>56</b> and the frictional grip of the inwardly facing surface of the insert <b>52</b> against the shaft <b>46</b>. The plate <b>56</b> and the insert <b>52</b> are preferably nylon, but can be made of any other suitable electrically insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The flight cutter <b>60</b> (shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>) has a pair of opposed blades <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> and a central aperture <b>64</b> through which the shaft <b>46</b> extends. The aperture <b>64</b> preferably has a hexagonally-shaped, inwardly facing sidewall that complements the hexagonally shaped shaft <b>46</b>, so that the complementary surfaces not only align the flight cutter on the tool <b>10</b>, but also maintain the blades <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> in the same position relative to the flight <b>14</b> during use by preventing relative rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The blades <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> have sharp edges <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> to cut into the particulate material through which the tool <b>10</b> is intended to bore. The blades <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> have recesses <b>61</b>&#x2032; and <b>62</b>&#x2032; respectively, formed therein in the top surface of the flight cutter <b>60</b>. An end of the flight <b>14</b> rests in one of the recesses due to the angular alignment between the aperture in the flight cutter and the shaft <b>46</b>. The flight <b>14</b> resting in a recess of the flight cutter <b>60</b> is exposed to little of the wear to which the cutting surface is normally subject during use, since the flight cutter <b>60</b> cuts into and breaks up the material. The flight cutter <b>60</b> is preferably slightly larger in diameter (such as one-quarter inch) than the flight <b>14</b>, thereby reducing drag of the flight against the sidewall of holes formed by the flight cutter <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flight cutter <b>60</b>, which is made of tool steel or another durable material and receives the majority of the wear, can be replaced easily when it is worn beyond its limit. Because the flight cutter <b>60</b> is interposed on the shaft <b>46</b> between the end of the axle <b>20</b> and the housing <b>50</b> of the nose <b>40</b>, the flight cutter <b>60</b> can be replaced by simply removing the nose <b>40</b>, sliding the flight cutter <b>60</b> off the shaft <b>46</b>, and then placing a new or sharpened flight cutter on the shaft <b>46</b>. The nose <b>40</b> is then reattached to the axle <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Similarly, the cutting tip <b>42</b>, which is at the tip of the tool <b>10</b> and is the first surface to puncture the soil or other particulate, can be replaced easily. The pin <b>54</b> is removed and the shaft <b>41</b> is displaced axially out of the insert <b>52</b>. A new or sharpened cutting tip is then inserted in place of the tip <b>42</b>, and the pin (or a replacement pin) is driven into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because of the configuration of the nose <b>40</b>, if the cutting tip <b>42</b> strikes an electrical line there is no electrically conductive path to the shaft <b>46</b>. Therefore, there is no possibility for the operator of the boring device in which the tool <b>10</b> is mounted to be shocked or electrocuted unless he or she is in contact with the tip <b>42</b>. This configuration reduces the possibility that the operator will be harmed. It is possible to use only the drive fitting <b>100</b>, which has means for electrically insulating the shaft <b>130</b> from any shaft inserted into the bore <b>106</b>, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,871 instead of the insulating means of the nose <b>40</b>, or in addition to it. It is also contemplated to insulate the entire nose and flight cutter <b>60</b> by interposing a fitting similar to the fitting <b>100</b> between the nose and the axle <b>20</b>. In this example (not shown), the flight cutter <b>60</b> is positioned as shown, and an extra flight cutter can be interposed between the insulator and the axle <b>100</b> to protect the flight end. The extra flight cutter can be angled approximately 90 degrees relative to the flight cutter <b>60</b> to provide extra stability.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The fitting <b>100</b> used alone provides electric shock protection for anyone holding the drill, but not for someone who contacts the axle <b>20</b> or flight <b>14</b>. Thus, the insulating means in the nose <b>40</b> and/or the additional insulator interposed between the nose and the axle <b>20</b> provides electric shock protection from the point of contact with the electric line to the user. The radial path of conduction from the shaft <b>41</b> to the housing <b>50</b> is broken up by the pin <b>54</b> and the insert <b>52</b>, and the longitudinal path of conduction is broken up by the plate <b>56</b>, which separates the shaft <b>41</b> from the shaft <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Other means for electrically insulating the cutting tip <b>40</b> from the shaft <b>46</b> are contemplated. Other such means include the structures shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,871 to Drumm et al, which is herein incorporated by reference. The preferred insulator is made of an electrically nonconductive material that is also rigid, such as nylon. The insulator is a safety feature, because the hole-forming operation is commonly performed near buried electrical wires. If a wire is struck, the insulator prevents electricity from flowing through the tool <b>10</b> and to the drill or other device that the user is holding or contacting.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tool <b>10</b> can be attached to one or more other substantially similar tool sections in order to increase the length of the boring device. Whereas the tool <b>10</b> is approximately 24 inches long, the effective boring length can be increased by attaching a similar structure <b>510</b> having an axle <b>500</b> with a flight <b>502</b> and a shaft <b>504</b> similar to the tool <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such a structure <b>510</b> can be mounted to the tool <b>10</b> by inserting the shaft <b>30</b> into the shaft-receiving bore <b>506</b> formed in the axle <b>500</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A fastener, such as a screw <b>520</b>, extends through the axle <b>500</b> sidewall and into the bore <b>506</b>, seating against the shaft <b>30</b> of the tool <b>10</b>. The shaft <b>30</b> has on one of its sides at least one, and preferably two, cavities <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The cavities <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> receive the ends of fasteners, when the tool <b>10</b> is used in conjunction with the structure <b>510</b>, and restrict longitudinal movement of the shaft <b>30</b> relative to the axle <b>500</b>. Similar screws (not shown) extend through the sidewall of the axle <b>20</b> to seat against the shaft <b>46</b> inserted into a shaft-receiving bore in the end of the axle <b>20</b> opposite the shaft <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The shaft <b>130</b> of the drive fitting <b>100</b> is preferably made of tool steel or some other hardened material to resist deformation under the force of the gripping chuck, and is preferably formed in a shape that will not fit into the shaft-receiving bores of the other components. This ensures that only the correct shaft <b>130</b> will be chucked in the drill. All other complementary shafts can fit into the shaft-receiving bore <b>106</b> of the fitting <b>100</b>. These other shafts are preferably normal steel, and are not deformed by the forces encountered when inserted into a shaft-receiving bore, but would typically be deformed by a drill chuck. Thus, other than the shaft <b>130</b>, all shafts can be inserted into all shaft-receiving bores, and alignment of the components is assured due to the precise angular alignment of the shafts with the bores' sidewalls.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the cutting tip <b>142</b> and nose shaft <b>146</b> are integrated, rather than being separately replaceable. The cutting blades <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are fixed to the cutting tip housing <b>150</b>, such as by slitting the housing <b>150</b> and welding or brazing the blades <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> therein. The flight cutter <b>160</b> is removably mounted to the nose <b>142</b> in the same manner as the preferred embodiment described above. Another alternative cutting tip <b>240</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, the tool <b>10</b> is drivingly linked to a drill or other portable rotary machine through the fitting <b>100</b>. The drill chuck matingly receives the outer surface of the shaft <b>130</b> of the fitting <b>100</b> as is common for tools such as drill bits and, once tightened, drivingly links the rotary motor of the drill to the fitting <b>100</b>, and, thereby, drivingly links to the tool <b>10</b>. Once the tool <b>10</b> is in the drill, any one of the cutting tips described herein is attached to the tool <b>10</b> for boring. Attachment of the cutting tip can be performed prior to or after drivingly linking the tool <b>10</b> to the drill, but it should be understood that the cutting tip can be changed even while the axle <b>20</b> is mounted to the drill. The preferred tool <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has the cutting tip <b>40</b> drivingly linked to the axle <b>20</b> by inserting the shaft <b>46</b> in the shaft-receiving bore and tightening of one or more screws (not shown) against the shaft <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the tool <b>10</b> is assembled and mounted in a drill, the blade <b>43</b> of the cutting tip <b>42</b> is manually placed in contact against a particulate medium, such as sand, dirt, clay, or other soils, for boring. The drill is then switched on to rotate the tool <b>10</b> while the user applies a longitudinal force toward the cutting tip <b>42</b> in the direction of a hole that is to be formed by the tool <b>10</b>. The cutting tip <b>42</b> enters the medium first, forming a hole the width of the blade <b>43</b> and the depth of the combination of the blade <b>43</b> and the housing <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The flight cutter <b>60</b> next contacts the medium and initiates the formation of the larger hole by cutting and breaking up the medium. As the tool <b>10</b> progresses into the medium with the longitudinal axis of the axle <b>20</b> substantially parallel to the sides of the hole, the flight cutter forms a large diameter hole, and the flights of the auger drive the particulate removed from the medium away from the flight cutter <b>60</b> and out of the hole formed. During the rotation of the tool <b>10</b> within the hole, debris and soil are cut from the surrounding soil and removed from the hole by the rotation of the auger flight <b>14</b> in a conventional manner. The rotating flight <b>14</b> pushes the debris and soil from the hole out to the surrounding environment, such as the ground around the hole, as the auger is displaced into and out of the hole a short distance. Rotation continues until the tool <b>10</b> bores the hole as deep as possible or desired, and the rotary motion is ceased.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">During the first part of the hole-forming operation, the tool <b>10</b> and nose <b>40</b> are connected together and used alone as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Once the hole is as deep as it can be with the tool <b>10</b>, an additional structure <b>510</b>, as described above, can be mounted to the tool <b>10</b>. The user can add one or more of the structures <b>510</b> between the fitting <b>100</b> and the tool <b>10</b>, by disengaging the respective cooperating fasteners, interposing the structure <b>510</b> between the fitting <b>100</b> and the tool <b>10</b>, and then engaging the respective cooperating fasteners. Then the longer auger is rotated and the boring process continues.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be apparent that different cutting tip shapes can be used instead of those described herein. Furthermore, flight cutters of different shape, and a different number of blades, can be substituted for those shown herein. This is because the detailed description in connection with the drawings is intended principally as a description of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and is not intended to represent the only form in which the present invention may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth the designs, functions, means, and methods of implementing the invention in connection with the illustrated embodiments.
