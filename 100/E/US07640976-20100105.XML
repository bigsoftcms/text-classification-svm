<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of expandable tubulars and more specifically to a method and apparatus for running downhole tubulars of a diameter smaller than the size of the casing already installed in the wellbore and expanding the tubular to a larger diameter downhole.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Expandable tubulars have become a viable technology for well drilling, repair, and completion. In one technique, the expandable tubular string has a pre-expanded portion (e.g., expansion swage launcher) at the bottom of the string with the expansion swage inserted in the launcher. Hydraulic pressure may be applied through a drill pipe to an area below the expansion swage to generate a force for propagation of the swage through the tubular and subsequent expansion of the tubular. One drawback of this technique is the safety aspect of the operation at the end of the expansion process. For instance, when the expansion swage is exiting from the expanded tubular (e.g., &#x201c;pop-out&#x201d; point), the entire volume of expanded tubular may be under the high pressure, and the tubular may be radially and longitudinally stretched by the pressure. The expandable tubular string typically employed may have a length of several thousand feet and may be expanded by applying three thousand to five thousand pounds per square inch of pressure. The combined energy of the compressed liquid and of the elastically stretched tubular, when instantly released at the pop-out point, may propel the drill pipe with the expansion swage acting as a piston out of the well causing equipment damage and injuries to the rig personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another technique includes an expansion device having an expansion cone, an actuator capable of displacing the expansion cone, and two end anchors capable of preventing movement of the actuator when the expansion cone is displaced. A drawback of this device is that it may not reset automatically. For instance, the repeated steps of application and withdrawal of hydraulic pressure to the whole system, including drill pipe, are time consuming, uneconomical in operation, and not suitable for expanding long tubulars. Techniques have been developed to overcome such drawbacks. For instance, techniques include an expansion device that includes an expansion cone, an actuator, two or three anchoring devices as well as a sliding valve that may automatically reset the actuator. The sliding valve may be positioned in an annular chamber of a double-walled cone-guide shaft. In addition, the sliding valve may be displaced between a front position, in which the valve passage is at the front side of the actuator piston, and a rear position, in which the valve passage is at the rear side of the actuator piston. Drawbacks to such a design include that the valve does not provide passage for the liquid out of the chamber on one side of the piston when the pressure is applied in the chamber on the other side of the piston, which may create a pressure lock and make the actuator in-operational. Further drawbacks include that the modification of such valve design, in order to incorporate fluid passage out from one side of the actuator piston and pressure fluid entering on the other side of the actuator piston simultaneously, may be difficult because the sliding valve provides communication with high pressure line only.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a safe and efficient technique of tubular radial expansion in downhole conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other needs in the art are addressed in one embodiment by an apparatus for radially expanding a tubular in a wellbore. The apparatus comprises an expansion swage and at least one anchoring device for selective and releasable anchoring of selected parts of the apparatus to an inner surface of the tubular. The apparatus also comprises a thruster providing a force for longitudinal movement of the expansion swage inside the tubular. In addition, the apparatus includes a hydraulic valve for selective control of a flow of operating fluid to the thruster. The hydraulic valve includes a valve cylinder slidably positioned on a shaft and a position control device for selective and releasable securing a position of the valve cylinder on the shaft. In addition, the hydraulic valve includes an elastic device for shifting the valve cylinder between two end positions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, these and other needs in the art are addressed by a method for placing and expanding an expandable tubular in a cased or an open hole wellbore. The method comprises delivering the tubular and a tubular expansion apparatus to a desired location in the wellbore on a conduit having a path for conveying fluid to the tubular expansion apparatus. The method further includes providing an expansion swage. In addition, the method includes providing a first anchoring device connected to the expansion swage. The method also includes providing a second anchoring device connected to a shaft. Moreover, the method includes providing a thruster for providing a force for longitudinal movement of the expansion swage inside the tubular and expanding the tubular. The method also includes providing a hydraulic valve for automatically alternating pressure fluid delivery and withdrawal to the thruster. The hydraulic valve includes a valve cylinder positioned on the shaft and a position control device for selective and releasable securing a position of the valve cylinder on the shaft. The hydraulic valve also includes an elastic device for shifting the valve cylinder between end positions. The method further includes applying hydraulic pressure through the conduit at a selected rate (e.g., pump rate) and expanding the tubular. In an embodiment, the shaft has multiple bores for fluid passage (i.e., passage between the valve, thruster, and anchoring device). In an embodiment, the thruster and valve cylinder have elongated arms with length about equal to the length of the stroke of the thruster.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> illustrate a cycle of operation of a tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, tubular expansion apparatus S includes a hydraulic valve <b>14</b>, a thruster <b>15</b> connected to an expansion swage <b>16</b>, a swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b> connected to expansion swage <b>16</b>, and a back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> connected to a shaft <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Thruster <b>15</b> may include any device having a hydraulic device means that may provide a force to axially move expansion swage <b>16</b> inside expandable tubular <b>11</b> to plastically radially expand expandable tubular <b>11</b>. Expandable tubular <b>11</b> includes any expandable tubular suitable for being plastically radially expanded by the application of a radial expansion force. Without limitation, examples of expandable tubulars include a liner, casing, borehole clad to seal a selected zone, or the like. For instance, the expandable tubular may be a tubular string of interconnected tubular members or a coiled tubing tubular. Expansion swage <b>16</b> may include any device that generates radial forces to plastically increase tubular diameter when it is displaced in a longitudinal direction in expandable tubular <b>11</b>. Without limitation, an example of an expansion swage includes a tapered cone of a fixed or a variable diameter. Moreover, an anchoring mechanism refers to a device capable of being selectively releasably engaged with a inner surface of expandable tubular <b>11</b> and that may prevent movement of selected parts of tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> relative to expandable tubular <b>11</b> under applied forces during the expansion process.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>, a tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> is deployed in a wellbore (not illustrated) on a drill pipe <b>12</b>. It is to be understood that tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> is not limited to being deployed on a drill pipe but may be deployed on any suitable conduit. For instance, in an alternative embodiment, such a conduit may include a string of coiled tubing. Expandable tubular <b>11</b> may be attached to drill pipe <b>12</b> by means of a casing lock <b>13</b>. Casing lock <b>13</b> includes any device capable of being releasably anchored to the inner surface of expandable tubular <b>11</b> during deployment of expandable tubular <b>11</b> in the wellbore. During the deployment of tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b>, hydraulic valve <b>14</b> and thruster <b>15</b> are in the position to commence the power stroke. Power stroke refers to a movement of expansion swage <b>16</b> relative to expandable tubular <b>11</b> in the direction corresponding to radial expansion of expandable tubular <b>11</b>. After tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> has been located at a desired location in the wellbore, a motive fluid under pressure may be supplied down through drill pipe <b>12</b> to tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b>. Thruster <b>15</b> is actuated, and at a certain pressure, thruster <b>15</b> displaces expansion swage <b>16</b> inside expandable tubular <b>11</b> and provides expanded tubular <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. During this cycle, casing lock <b>13</b> remains engaged with the inner part of expandable tubular <b>11</b>, which prevents sliding of the shaft inside expandable tubular <b>11</b>. At the end of the power stroke, hydraulic valve <b>14</b> is automatically switched to commence the reset stroke. Reset stroke refers to a movement of the tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> relative to the tubular. Also, at the end of the first power stoke, casing lock <b>13</b> is disengaged and remains disengaged during the remainder of the expansion process.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, during the reset stroke, swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b> is engaged with the inner surface of the expanded tubular <b>21</b> and prevents movement of expansion swage <b>16</b> relative to expanded tubular <b>21</b>. Back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> is disengaged, and thruster <b>15</b> displaces back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> inside expanded tubular <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, at the end of the reset stroke, hydraulic valve <b>14</b> automatically switches to the power stroke, i.e., back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> is engaged, which prevents movement of shaft <b>22</b> relative to expanded tubular <b>21</b>; swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b> is disengaged; and thruster <b>15</b> is in power stroke mode displacing expansion swage <b>16</b> further into expandable tubular <b>11</b>. These cycles may continue automatically until the entire length of expandable tubular <b>11</b> is expanded. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, at the end of expansion, expansion swage <b>16</b> departs from expanded tubular <b>21</b> by being displaced by thruster <b>15</b> against back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b>. The pressure is released, and tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> may be removed from the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood that the expansion process described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> may be referred to as a &#x201c;bottom-up&#x201d; process such that the process begins at a lower end of expandable tubular <b>11</b> with expansion swage <b>16</b> propagating upwards through expandable tubular <b>11</b> for radial expansion thereof. The terms &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; herein refer to the orientation of a tubular member in a conventional borehole that is a deviated or a horizontal borehole. &#x201c;Upper&#x201d; refers to the end of the tubular member that is nearest the surface of the well. It is to be understood that tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> and methods of expansion using tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> may be applied using a technique that expands tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> from the upper end to the lower end.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a longitudinal cross-section of an embodiment of tubular expansion apparatus <b>5</b> having hydraulic valve <b>14</b>, thruster <b>15</b>, expansion swage <b>16</b>, swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b>, shaft <b>22</b>, and back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b>. Pressure lines <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>53</b> are a schematic representation of borehole passages for fluid in shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, thruster <b>15</b> includes a hydraulic drive means including a piston <b>43</b> attached to shaft <b>22</b>, and a cylinder <b>42</b> slidably arranged over piston <b>43</b> and shaft <b>22</b>. Cylinder <b>42</b> includes pressure chambers <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> separated by piston <b>43</b>. A pressure chamber refers to a pressure sealed annular compartment, for instance between a cylinder and a shaft. Cylinder <b>42</b> is connected to expansion swage <b>16</b>. Supply pressure chamber <b>46</b> is adapted to provide liquid communication between pressure line <b>53</b>, expansion swage <b>16</b>, and swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b>. Thruster <b>15</b> includes piston <b>43</b> and cylinder <b>42</b> having pressure chambers <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>. It should be understood that although one piston <b>43</b> and one cylinder <b>42</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, any number of cylinders and/or pistons may be provided. The hydraulic rust provided by thruster <b>15</b> increases as the number of pressure chambers increases, i.e. the hydraulic force provided by the pressure chambers is additive. Thus, the number of cylinders may be selected according to the desired operational pressure and/or the desired thrust force for the tubular expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Hydraulic valve <b>14</b> includes a cylinder <b>31</b> longitudinally slidably engaged with shaft <b>22</b> and forming an internal annular pressure chamber <b>35</b> surrounding shaft <b>22</b>. Hydraulic valve <b>14</b> is a two-position valve with a first end position corresponding to a power stroke mode of thruster <b>15</b>, and a second end position corresponding to a reset stroke of thruster <b>15</b>. In an embodiment, hydraulic valve <b>14</b> includes a position control element <b>29</b> to selectively and releasably lock cylinder <b>31</b> in first or second end positions. Without limitation, examples of suitable position control elements <b>29</b> include a C-ring locking mechanism and a collet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> illustrate a position control element <b>29</b> that is a C-ring locking mechanism employed in hydraulic valve <b>14</b>. A C-ring locking mechanism is a ring with a circular shape and a cut <b>66</b> that allows the ring to be elastically radially deformed at the radial deflection corresponding to the depth of grooves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> provided in shaft <b>22</b>. The C-ring has an initial internal diameter generally equal to the diameter of grooves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>. The C-ring is positioned in groove <b>24</b> in cylinder <b>31</b> with the depth of groove <b>24</b> not less than the thickness of the C-ring. The C-ring may be engaged or disengaged in grooves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in shaft <b>22</b> under the action of an axial force F applied to cylinder <b>31</b>. Force F is a function of the following parameters: the stiffness of die C-ring, the depth of the groove, the wedge angle <b>55</b> of groove <b>26</b>, and the friction coefficient between the groove and the C-ring. Therefore, using conventional methods of calculation, the parameters listed above may be selected to provide a desired value of the axial force F for disengagement of the C-ring out of the shaft groove.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood that the C-ring may bear against any suitable surfaces or any components having a fixed relationship with shaft <b>22</b> and/or with the valve cylinder. The C-ring may be configured to operate primarily in tension of primarily in compression. It is also to be understood that other position control elements, such as collets, snap-rings and the like, capable of selectively and releasably securing a position of the valve cylinder on the shaft, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The shifting between the end positions of hydraulic valve <b>14</b> is provided by displacement of thruster <b>15</b>. Both the hydraulic valve <b>14</b> and thruster <b>15</b> have elongated arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, respectively. Elastic devices <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are positioned at the ends of arm <b>40</b>. Any suitable elastic device may be used such as springs. In an embodiment, elastic device <b>32</b> is a spring, and elastic device <b>33</b> is a spring. The length of arm <b>41</b> is generally equal to the length of the total stroke displacement of cylinder <b>42</b> (e.g., thruster cylinder), while the length of arm <b>40</b> is generally equal to arm <b>41</b> (e.g., thruster arm) in addition to at least a combined length of the solid heights of elastic devices <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. Each elastic device <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> is capable of displacing cylinder <b>31</b> from the first valve position to the second valve position and vice versa, i.e. over a length, l, between grooves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>. It is to be understood that the minimum force, F1, for shifting cylinder <b>31</b> (e.g., valve cylinder) is equal to the friction force between cylinder <b>31</b> and shaft <b>22</b> plus the weight of cylinder <b>31</b>. Therefore, elastic devices <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are designed to provide a force F1 at the end of displacement l, which defines a force, F2, at the start of displacement of cylinder <b>31</b> from the first or the second position. Therefore, the C-ring design, as discussed above, is based on the axial force F for disengagement of the C-ring out of the shaft groove being equal to the force P2. The shifting of the valve from one position to the other takes place at the end of the power or reset strokes of thruster <b>15</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, at the end of a stroke, arm <b>41</b> (e.g., thruster arm) compresses elastic device <b>33</b> against arm <b>40</b> (e.g., valve arm) generating the force F2. Under the action of force F2, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the C-ring is disengaged from groove <b>25</b>, and, under the action of elastic device <b>33</b>, valve cylinder <b>31</b> is shifted to the other end position, i.e. the ring is moved to groove <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is to be understood that elastic devices <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> may bear against any suitable surfaces or any components having a fixed relationship with cylinder <b>31</b> and/or cylinder <b>42</b> (e.g., thruster cylinder). It is also to be understood that elastic devices <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> may be configured to operate primarily in tension or primarily in compression, with a desire including shifting cylinder <b>31</b> between first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, pressurized operating fluid is pumped through the drill pipe into main pressure line <b>51</b>. Hydraulic valve <b>14</b> is in the second position corresponding to the reset stroke mode of operation. In the reset mode, pre chamber <b>35</b> provides communication between main pressure line <b>51</b> and operational pressure line <b>53</b>. Operational pressure line <b>52</b> is connected with pressure chamber <b>45</b> (e.g., power stroke chamber) and with back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b>. In the reset stroke mode, the operational pressure line <b>52</b> is vented through vent <b>34</b>, providing liquid flow from pressure chamber <b>45</b> and from back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b>. The pressure is applied through operational pressure line <b>53</b> to reset pressure chamber <b>44</b> and to supply pressure chamber <b>46</b> connected to swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b>. In this configuration, swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b> is engaged with the inner surface of the expandable tubular (not shown) preventing movement of cylinder <b>42</b> relative to the tubular, and the back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> is in disengaged position. The pressure applied to piston <b>43</b> urges shaft <b>22</b> to be moved further inside the tubular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, at the end of the reset stroke, elastic device <b>33</b> is compressed between the ends of elongated arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, which generates spring force to displace the C-ring out of groove <b>25</b> and to displace cylinder <b>31</b> to the end position corresponding to the power stroke mode of operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in this configuration, the C-ring is positioned in groove <b>26</b>, the pressure chamber <b>35</b> (e.g., valve pressure chamber) provides communication between main pressure line <b>51</b> and operational line <b>52</b>, and operational pressure line <b>53</b> is vented through vent <b>30</b> providing flow of the liquid from reset pressure chamber <b>44</b> and supply pressure chamber <b>46</b>. Swage anchoring mechanism <b>17</b> is depressurized and disengaged from the tubular. Back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> is under pressure provided through operational pressure line <b>52</b> and is engaged with the inner surface of the expandable tubular (not shown) preventing movement of shaft <b>22</b> relative to the tubular. The pressure is applied in pressure chamber <b>45</b> through pressure line <b>52</b>, which urges cylinder <b>42</b> with expansion swage <b>16</b> to move further in the tubular providing radial expansion of the tubular. The expansion continues until elastic device <b>32</b> is compressed, and cylinder <b>31</b> is shifted in a similar manner back to the reset stroke. Thus, delivery of the pressurized fluid through pressure line <b>51</b> causes the cycles described above to be repeated automatically until the length of the tubular is expanded. It is to be understood that the automatic process may be stopped at any time by discontinuing delivery of pressure fluid and may be restarted by re-establishing delivery of pressure fluid. Without being limited by theory, the final departure of expansion swage <b>16</b> from expanded tubular <b>21</b> is safe, since expansion swage <b>16</b> is displaced from expanded tubular <b>21</b> by thruster <b>15</b> while drill pipe <b>12</b> through shaft <b>22</b> is anchored to expanded tubular <b>21</b> by back anchoring mechanism <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An advantage of the location of the anchoring mechanisms is the elimination of possible damage to the unexpanded portion of the tubular, which may cause rupture of the tubular during expansion. Therefore, the configuration of the tubular expansion apparatus with anchoring mechanisms located in the expanded portion of the tubular significantly improves reliability of the expansion system. Another advantage of positioning the anchoring mechanisms in the area of the expanded portion of the tubular is the ability to displace the swage by the thruster (at the end of the expansion process) by pushing against the anchoring mechanism engaged with the tubular, which may eliminate any propulsion of the drill pipe out of the well and may allow for the departure of the expansion swage from the tubular in a safe manner.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations may be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For instance, expansion swage <b>16</b> may be attached to shaft <b>22</b>, and the front anchor may be designed to be engaged with the inner surface of the unexpanded portion of the pipe.</p>
