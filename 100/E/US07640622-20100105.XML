<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment have means to raise and lower the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms and the skirt mechanisms. These systems generally have two positions: down to engage the floor surface and up to disengage the floor surface. The downward force on the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms and skirt mechanisms is not adjustable. Further, the lateral position of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms and skirt mechanisms is not adjustable in conventional floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, one embodiment the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment of the present invention includes a hydraulic system and adjustable linkages to allow a user to adjust particular features to suit the equipment for different applications. Adjustable features include hydraulic cylinders that allow adjustments in the downward pressure on the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms and on the skirts such that the equipment may be configured for applications such as brushing, grinding, or polishing. Further, the lateral position of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms and the skirts is adjustable such that a user may increase the coverage area or increase the overlap in coverage by the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms as required by any particular application. Moreover, a preferred embodiment incorporates means for adjusting both the forward and backward speed of the equipment as well as the rotational speed of the motor(s) driving the brushing, grinding, or polishing wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A second embodiment of the floor grinder/scrubber is a ride-on machine designed and engineered for heavy duty grinding of concrete floors using special planetary heads and grinding pads. Water from a 60-gallon supply tank mounted on the floor grinder/scrubber is supplied to the floor under the grinding pads for the grinding process. The used slurry is vacuumed through a rear squeegee into an 80-gallon recovery tank mounted on the floor grinder/scrubber.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The floor grinder/scrubber can also be used as a floor scrubber for a wide range of applications when equipped with the appropriate scrubbing wheels and can be used in conjunction with other systems providing complete wastewater filtration, recycling and disposal.</p>

The keyed adaptor <b>118</b> includes a keyed center bore for receiving the keyed drive shaft of the hydraulic valve <b>46</b>. A set screw through the side of the keyed adaptor <b>118</b> and into the drive shaft holds the keyed adaptor <b>118</b> in place. A key couples the drive shaft to the keyed adaptor <b>118</b> such that rotation of the drive shaft is transferred to the keyed adaptor <b>118</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>shows the drive knuckle <b>112</b> assembled to the hydraulic valve <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the receptor <b>114</b> includes a cylindrical wall <b>128</b>, a circular flange <b>130</b>, a spring loaded clasp <b>132</b>, and pins <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b</i>. The cylindrical wall <b>128</b> and the circular flange <b>130</b> are best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the circular flange <b>130</b> is affixed to the brush plate <b>49</b> such as by screws, adhesive or other suitable affixing means. The clasp <b>132</b> includes anchor bar <b>136</b>, lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <b>138</b><i>b</i>, and finger levers <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>. The anchor bar <b>136</b> is affixed to or integral with the cylindrical wall <b>128</b>. The lock bar <b>138</b><i>a </i>is pivotally connected to one end of the anchor bar <b>136</b> and the lock bar <b>138</b><i>b </i>is pivotally connected to the other end of the anchor bar <b>136</b>. The lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>each penetrate a side of the cylindrical wall <b>128</b> such that the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are slidable within the slots in the sides of the cylindrical wall <b>128</b>. A torsion spring <b>139</b><i>a </i>engages the pivotal connection of the lock bar <b>138</b><i>a </i>to the anchor bar <b>136</b> to bias the lock bar <b>138</b><i>a </i>into the slot in the cylindrical wall <b>128</b>. Similarly, torsion spring <b>139</b><i>b </i>engages the pivotal connection of the lock bar <b>138</b><i>b </i>to the anchor bar <b>136</b> to bias the lock bar <b>138</b><i>b </i>into the slot in the cylindrical wall <b>128</b>. The finger levers <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>are affixed to or integral with a respective lock bar <b>138</b><i>a </i>or <b>138</b><i>b</i>. The pins <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b </i>are affixed to or integral with the inner surface of the cylindrical wall <b>128</b> and are substantially directly opposite to one another. In an alternate configuration, there are three pins <b>134</b><i>c</i>, <b>134</b><i>d</i>, and <b>134</b><i>e</i>, each having an axis approximately 110 degrees from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the quick disconnect mechanism <b>110</b> is engaged, the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>rest behind the cone-shaped end <b>120</b> of the drive interface <b>116</b>, proximate to the projection <b>122</b>. The two pins <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b </i>engage the slots <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>d</i>, respectively to transfer rotation of the drive knuckle <b>112</b> to the receptor <b>114</b>, and thus to the brush <b>48</b>. In the alternative having three pins, the pins <b>134</b><i>c</i>, <b>134</b><i>d</i>, and <b>134</b><i>e </i>engage the slots <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b</i>, and <b>124</b><i>c</i>, respectively. Therefore, the drive knuckle <b>112</b> can accommodate multiple receptor configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In use, the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> must first be configured for the particular application. The force applied to the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> is independently variable by separately adjusting the fluid pressure applied to the pistons <b>38</b><i>a </i>in the hydraulic cylinders <b>38</b>. The force applied is determined for each particular application. The factors to consider include the application, such as sweeping, grinding, polishing, etc., the coefficient of friction between the brush <b>48</b> or grinding head <b>48</b><i>a </i>or polishing head <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the floor surface, and the flatness of the floor surface. An application with a high coefficient of friction may require a lower force applied to the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> to avoid stalling the brush <b>48</b> or grinding head <b>48</b><i>a </i>or polishing head <b>48</b><i>b</i>. Also, a particularly wavy floor surfaces may require a higher force applied to the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> to ensure contact with the high and low areas of the floor surface. In the preferred embodiment, the operable range of pressures applied to each of the pistons <b>38</b><i>a </i>in a scrubbing application is approximately 0.5-psi to 1.5-psi.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, the force applied by the pistons <b>58</b><i>a </i>on the skirt mechanisms <b>16</b> must also be adjusted. The factors to consider include the skirt <b>66</b> material and the abrasiveness of the floor surface. The downward force should be sufficient to prevent the wastewater from passing by the skirts <b>66</b> such that it is guided to the rear squeegee <b>21</b>. A downward force that is too high may cause excessive drag on the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b>. Further, an excessive downward force may cause damage to the skirts <b>66</b>, particularly when applied to an abrasive floor surface.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lateral position of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> and the skirt mechanisms <b>16</b> may also be adjusted. The lateral position of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> may be adjusted by loosening fasteners <b>50</b> and sliding the first linkage <b>30</b> along a slot <b>52</b>. The range of lateral motion of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> is limited by the range of motion allowed by the ball joint between the piston <b>38</b><i>a </i>and the second linkage <b>32</b>. Similarly, the skirt mechanisms <b>16</b> are adjusted by loosening the fasteners and sliding the support plate <b>56</b> along the slide rails <b>54</b>. The range of lateral motion of the skirt mechanisms <b>16</b> is limited by the range of motion allowed by the ball joint between the piston <b>58</b><i>a </i>and the rear arm <b>60</b>. Moving the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> toward each other decreases the coverage area while increasing the overlap in coverage between the frontmost brushes <b>48</b>, grinding heads <b>48</b><i>a</i>, or polishing heads <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the rearmost brush <b>48</b>, grinding head <b>48</b><i>a</i>, or polishing head <b>48</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, widening the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> increases the coverage area while decreasing the overlap in coverage between the frontmost brushes <b>48</b>, grinding heads <b>48</b><i>a</i>, or polishing heads <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the rearmost brush <b>48</b>, grinding head <b>48</b><i>a</i>, or polishing head <b>48</b><i>b</i>. A larger coverage area is desirable in cleaning applications using brushes <b>48</b>, while more overlap in coverage between the front grinding heads <b>48</b><i>a </i>and the rear grinding head <b>48</b><i>b </i>is desirable in a grinding application.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once the adjustments are made, the user may start up the components of the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> using the control panel <b>96</b>. The user puts the gearbox <b>94</b> into a forward gear while actuating the brakes. The rear squeegee <b>21</b> is automatically lowered. The user actuates the compressor <b>18</b> to lower the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> and the skirt mechanisms <b>16</b>. Then actuates the water distribution and collection system <b>20</b>, which pumps water through the distribution hoses <b>72</b> to the scrubbing/resurfacing heads <b>34</b> and activates the vacuum <b>78</b>. Releasing the brakes and pressing the throttle <b>84</b> actuates the micro-switch for activating the hydraulic drive system <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> is now moving in the forward direction. The water cools the brush <b>48</b>, grinding head <b>48</b><i>a</i>, or polishing head <b>48</b><i>b </i>and carries any dirt or particles of the floor surface away from the scrubbing/resurfacing heads <b>34</b> as wastewater. The skirts <b>66</b> guide the wastewater to the rear squeegee <b>21</b>. The vacuum <b>78</b> draws the wastewater into the vacuum hose <b>76</b> and outlets the wastewater into the wastewater reservoir <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> is able to drive up to a wall ensuring coverage up to the wall by the frontmost scrubbing/resurfacing heads <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The user may still turn left or right because of the three wheel configuration of the vehicle portion <b>22</b>. The configuration of the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> having the rearmost scrubbing/resurfacing mechanism <b>14</b><i>b </i>in front of the front wheel <b>24</b> ensures that substantially no part of the floor surface that passes under the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> is missed by the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> while the equipment is turning a corner.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to attach the brush <b>48</b> to the hydraulic valve <b>46</b> using quick-disconnect mechanism <b>110</b>, the pins <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are lined up with the slots <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <i>d </i>and the receptor <b>114</b> is pushed onto the drive knuckle <b>112</b> such that the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are forced outward by the cone-shaped end <b>120</b> of the drive interface <b>116</b>. When the drive knuckle <b>112</b> fully engages the receptor <b>114</b>, the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are forced back into place by torsion springs <b>139</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>. The lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>now rest behind the cone-shaped end <b>120</b> of the drive interface <b>116</b> and hold the receptor <b>114</b> onto the drive knuckle <b>116</b>. This procedure is the same for the three-pin alternative except that the pins <b>134</b><i>c, d</i>, and <i>e </i>are lined up with the slots <b>124</b><i>a, b</i>, and <i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To detach the brush <b>48</b> from the hydraulic valve <b>46</b> using the quick-disconnect mechanism <b>110</b>, the finger levers <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>are depressed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This forces the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>out from behind the cone-shaped end <b>120</b> of the drive interface <b>116</b> and the receptor <b>114</b> easily slides off the drive knuckle <b>112</b>. As the finger levers <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are released, the torsion springs force the lock bars <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>back into the slots in the cylindrical wall <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be particularly pointed out that in the preferred embodiment, the compressor <b>18</b> has a maximum output of 100-psi and the fluid reservoir <b>68</b> has a 3-gallon capacity. The hydraulic cylinders <b>38</b> and <b>58</b> have a 3-inch bore and 4.5-inches of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should further be particularly noted that a desirable advantage of the preferred embodiment is that the present invention is configured such that all the scrubbing/resurfacing mechanisms <b>14</b> are situated in front of the front wheel <b>24</b> such that the present invention maintains substantially complete coverage of the surface while turning a corner whereas the conventional configuration of having one scrubbing/resurfacing mechanism behind the front wheel may leave uncovered areas on the surface at turns.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should even further be particularly noted that the advantages of situating the rear squeegee <b>21</b> directly behind the front wheel <b>24</b> as described in the preferred embodiment rather than behind the rear wheels <b>26</b> as in the conventional art include the fact that the rear wheels and other components that may be included with the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> are kept substantially clean and dry because the majority of the wastewater is picked up by the water distribution and collection system <b>20</b> prior to reaching these components. Further, less wastewater is lost out the side of the floor surface scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> while turning than is lost in the conventional art.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should still further be particularly noted that the floor scrubbing and resurfacing equipment <b>10</b> may include a sweeper such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Sweepers are often used alternatively with the water distribution and collection systems in the conventional art. In the present invention, however, the sweeper may be used in conjunction with the water distribution and collection system <b>20</b> because the rear squeegee <b>21</b> collects the wastewater prior to reaching the sweeper in the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the preferred embodiment, the rear squeegee <b>21</b> is located directly behind the front wheel <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the rear squeegee <b>21</b> may be located behind the rear wheels <b>26</b>. Further in the preferred embodiment, the rearmost scrubbing/resurfacing mechanism <b>14</b><i>b </i>is located in front of the front wheel <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the rearmost scrubbing/resurfacing mechanism <b>14</b><i>h </i>may be located behind the front wheel <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an alternative, the floor surface cleaning and resurfacing equipment of the present invention is configured in a walk behind unit rather than the vehicle configurations described above.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a more preferred embodiment, the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an industrial duty, ride-on machine for grinding concrete floors or scrubbing floors.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> grinding system, including a planetary head mounting deck <b>202</b>, a hydraulic system <b>204</b>, a water distribution and collection system <b>206</b> and controls <b>208</b>, provides for precise grinding performance and machine maneuvering during the grinding or scrubbing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The water distribution and collection system <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> includes a vacuum system <b>210</b> that recovers the grind slurry or scrub water into an recovery tank <b>212</b>. The recovery tank <b>212</b> has a level sensor that shuts off the vacuum <b>210</b> when the level of the recovered water or slurry reaches the capacity of the recovery tank <b>212</b>. The recovery tank <b>212</b> also includes a clean out port <b>214</b> on the top of the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>. A fill port <b>216</b> for a supply tank <b>218</b> is on the top of the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>, opposite to the clean out port <b>214</b>. A clean out port <b>220</b> for the vacuum <b>210</b> is also located on the top of the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the drain hose <b>222</b> connected to the recovery tank <b>212</b>. The drain hose <b>222</b> is used to drain the waste water in the recovery tank <b>212</b>. A rear squeegee <b>224</b> and vacuum hose <b>226</b> are connected to the vacuum system <b>210</b>. The rear squeegee <b>224</b> can be raised or lowered by hydraulic cylinders <b>227</b> using the squeegee control <b>228</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Lowering the rear squeegee <b>224</b> also activates the vacuum system <b>210</b>. The rear squeegee <b>224</b> directs used slurry toward the vacuum hose <b>226</b>. The vacuum system <b>210</b> draws the slurry through the vacuum system <b>210</b> into the recovery tank <b>212</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the water outlet tubes <b>230</b>, which direct the slurry or scrub water over the planetary heads <b>232</b>. The slurry or scrub water is pumped or gravity fed from the supply tank <b>218</b> and the flow is controlled by the solution supply control <b>234</b> on the control panel <b>208</b>. Each of the planetary heads <b>232</b> is surrounded by a shroud <b>236</b>, which directs the slurry or scrub water to the floor below the planetary heads <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The hydraulic system <b>204</b> includes a pump that is driven directly by the engine and has an output of 8 gallons per minute. The hydraulic system <b>204</b> supplies power from the engine to the motor for the drive wheel <b>238</b> (the right rear wheel), the three grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b>, the squeegee cylinders <b>227</b> and deck cylinders <b>242</b>. The speed of the motor for the drive wheel <b>238</b> is controlled by the forward speed control <b>244</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The motor for the drive wheel <b>238</b> is engaged in forward, reverse, or dynamic breaking by the foot pedals <b>246</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The foot pedals <b>246</b> do not control the speed of the drive wheel <b>238</b>, only the forward speed control <b>244</b> does this. The reverse speed is fixed. The speed of the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> is controlled separately from the forward speed by a grind motor speed lever <b>248</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>. The grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> are activated by grinder control <b>250</b>. The hydraulics driving the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> form a circuit such that the hydraulic fluid travels from the engine, to each of the motors in succession and back to the engine. The squeegee cylinders <b>227</b> are activated by the squeegee control <b>228</b> as stated above. The deck cylinders <b>242</b> are controlled by deck lift controls <b>252</b> to raise and lower the mounting deck <b>202</b>. The down pressure gauge <b>254</b> indicates the pressure that the deck cylinders <b>242</b> apply to the mounting deck <b>202</b>. This down pressure is adjusted by the down pressure manifold <b>256</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. A down pressure of 200-psi to 600-psi is desirable for most scrubbing and grinding operations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The details of one planetary head <b>232</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>e</i>. The drive motor <b>240</b> is mounted on mounting deck <b>202</b> and includes a spindle <b>258</b>, which is similar to that described in the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>e </i>show the installation of a media pad <b>260</b> to a grinding planetary head <b>232</b>. The media pad <b>260</b> is pressed firmly onto a rotating planetary carrier <b>262</b>. This configuration allows the grind media <b>260</b> to be changed easily. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>d </i>and <b>17</b><i>e </i>show how the planetary head <b>232</b> connects to the drive motor <b>240</b>. Similarly to the first embodiment, a head chuck <b>264</b> affixed to the planetary head <b>232</b> engages the spindle <b>258</b>. The system has an interlock that prevents the drive motors <b>240</b> from turning on while the mounting deck <b>202</b> is in the raised position to prevent damage to the machine or nearby objects.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To use the grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>, fill the supply tank <b>218</b> with the proper solution as required for the scrubbing or grinding application. A solution of detergent and water is desirable for scrubbing applications and a grinding slurry is desirable for grinding applications. Mount the appropriate planetary heads <b>232</b> on the grinding motor spindles <b>258</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>e </i>and as described above. Start the engine and allow it to warm up for at least 5 minutes to warn the hydraulic fluid. A longer warm-up period may be required in colder weather. Start the engine using the ignition switch <b>268</b> and adjust the engine speed with the engine speed control throttle <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Set the Grind Motor Speed for the application by changing the position of the grind motor speed lever <b>248</b> and securing the position selected. The recommended motor speed range is 80-190 rpm. Lower the rear squeegee <b>224</b> using the squeegee control <b>228</b> on the control panel <b>208</b>. For certain applications, the rear squeegee <b>224</b> is not used for the initial passes of the grinding operation. Lower the planetary head mounting deck <b>202</b>. Lowering the deck <b>202</b> without the planetary heads <b>232</b> could severely damage the spindles <b>258</b>. Start the solution flow through the water outlet tubes <b>230</b>, over the planetary heads <b>232</b> to the floor with the solution supply control <b>234</b> on the control console <b>208</b>. Adjust the solution flow to the desired level with the solution supply control <b>234</b>. Start the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> using the grinder control <b>250</b> on the console <b>208</b>. Release the parking brake and use the foot pedals <b>246</b> to start the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> moving over the area to be scrubbed or ground. Set the forward speed with the forward speed control <b>244</b> on the console <b>208</b>. To stop the machine, the foot pedal <b>246</b> is released. The pedal will return to the middle position and the dynamic brake will stop the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>. The foot pedals <b>246</b> are also used to set the parking break and to move in the reverse direction. Pressing down further on the foot pedal <b>246</b> will not cause the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> to increase speed in either the forward or reverse directions. The forward speed is controlled by the forward speed control <b>244</b> on the console <b>208</b>. Thus, a consistent forward speed is provided for grinding and scrubbing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the speed of the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> needs to be adjusted, bring the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> to a complete stop using the dynamic break and set the parking brake using the foot pedals <b>246</b>. Then turn the forward speed control <b>244</b> to the lowest setting and adjust the speed of the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b> using the grind motor speed lever <b>248</b>. When the grinding or scrubbing operation is compete, stop the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> by releasing pedal <b>246</b> and firmly pressing down on the brake pedal (left pedal). Lock the parking brake while continuing to engage the parking brake. Turn off the solution flow using the solution supply control <b>234</b>. Turn off the ignition and set the engine speed throttle <b>270</b> to the lowest setting. Then drain the recovery tank <b>212</b> by unclamping the drain hose <b>222</b> and clean thoroughly by rinsing with water or cleaning solutions. Also, clean the recovery tank filter <b>266</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. If the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b> is to be stored, also drain and clean out the solution tank <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be noted that heads designed for dry polishing may be mounted to the grinding/scrubbing head motors <b>240</b>. For dry polishing, the vacuum hose <b>226</b> is connected directly to the shrouds <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A mounting deck <b>302</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The deck <b>302</b> is mounted to the frame <b>304</b> by a central pivot <b>306</b>, two stabilizing arms <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), and a lift arm <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>). The lift arm <b>310</b> is hydraulically actuated to raise and lower the deck <b>302</b> as well as provide the down pressure to the deck <b>302</b> that is distributed to the planetary heads <b>232</b>. The lift arm <b>310</b> is centrally located behind the central pivot <b>306</b> to allow the deck <b>302</b> to pivot side to side about the central pivot <b>306</b> while still providing the down pressure. The ability of the deck <b>302</b> to pivot about the axis of the central pivot <b>306</b> ensures an even distribution of down pressure on the planetary heads <b>232</b> in situations that would otherwise cause an uneven down pressure. Such situations include turning the machine, variations in the surface being scrubbed or ground, and movement of the user that changes the distribution of weight over the deck <b>302</b>. The deck <b>302</b> is also able to pivot in the transverse direction to the axis of the central pivot <b>306</b> by a pivot that locks the transverse angular position prior to use of the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the transverse pivot is free to allow the deck <b>302</b> to pivot front to back during use of the floor grinder/scrubber <b>200</b>. In a further alternative, a knuckle that allows the deck <b>302</b> to pivot side to side and front to back replaces the central pivot <b>306</b> and the transverse pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that springs connecting each side of deck <b>302</b> to the frame <b>304</b> may be used to further stabilize the deck <b>302</b>. The springs prevent the deck <b>302</b> from tipping to one side or the other when the deck <b>302</b> is in the raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, grinder/scrubber <b>400</b> also uses the rapid changing planetary heads and drivers <b>402</b> previously described and by the positions of the grinder wheels or scrubber brushes <b>404</b> shown can provide a work surface of, e.g., 50 inches wide to work flush with walls. By the positioning of the various wheels as shown, the unit as illustrated is highly maneuverable by its ability to make a 180 degree turn in under 100 inches. A water cooled industrial LP, gasoline or diesel engine capable of operating at different precisely controlled speeds powers the grinder/scrubber <b>400</b>, with variable speed motors to turn the wheels and brushes and the hydraulic pressures adjusted as appropriate for the surface being worked and the operation being performed. The rear squeegee <b>406</b> can be a curved gum rubber blade, and preferably about a 60 gallon fiberglass supply tank and about an 80 gallon fiberglass recovery tank for the solutions applied and the waste recovered. At this capacity, the unit is capable of covering up to about 96,000 square feet per hour of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The grinder/scrubber <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, except that it also is provided with a full flexible rubber skirt <b>502</b> surrounding the grinder/scrubber wheels and engaging the floor surface to contain the solution applied and to draw by a conventional vacuum means the spent solution and waste material to the rearwardly mounted recovery tank <b>504</b>.</p>
