<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to equipment utilized and operations performed in conjunction with a subterranean well and, in an embodiment described herein, more particularly provides a method of initiating injection planes in a well.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is frequently desirable to be able to form generally planar inclusions in a subterranean formation or zone, in order to enhance production or injection of fluids between one or more wellbores and the formation or zone. It is even more desirable to be able to reliably orient such planar inclusions in selected directions, to extend the inclusions for desired distances and, in many circumstances, to maintain the planar form of the inclusions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hydraulic fracturing comprises a variety of well known methods of forming fractures in relatively hard and brittle rock. However, many of these methods have not been entirely successful in achieving precise directional orientation, dimensional control or planar form of such fractures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, the advanced techniques developed for the art of forming fractures in brittle rock are often inapplicable to the fundamentally different material properties of unconsolidated and/or weakly cemented formations. The rock in such formations behaves in a manner more accurately described as &#x201c;ductile,&#x201d; and defies attempts to orient and otherwise control planar inclusions therein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it may be seen that advancements are needed in the art of forming generally planar inclusions in subterranean formations. These advancements may find application in both brittle and ductile rock formations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In carrying out the principles of the present invention, methods are provided which solve at least one problem in the art. One example is described below in which an injection plane is initiated in a desired direction. Another example is described below in which the injection plane initiation facilitates directional, dimensional and geometric control over a generally planar inclusion in a formation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a method of forming at least one generally planar inclusion in a subterranean formation is provided. The method includes the steps of: expanding a wellbore in the formation by injecting a material into an annulus positioned between the wellbore and a casing lining the wellbore; increasing compressive stress in the formation as a result of the expanding step; and then injecting a fluid into the formation, thereby forming the inclusion in a direction of the increased compressive stress.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a method of forming at least one generally planar inclusion in a subterranean formation includes the steps of: expanding a wellbore in the formation by injecting a material into an annulus positioned between the wellbore and a casing lining the wellbore; reducing stress in the formation in a tangential direction relative to the wellbore; and then injecting a fluid into the formation, thereby forming the inclusion in a direction normal to the reduced tangential stress.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further aspect, a method of forming at least one generally planar inclusion in a subterranean formation includes the steps of: increasing compressive stress in the formation by injecting a material into an annulus positioned between the formation and a sleeve positioned in casing lining a wellbore; and then injecting a fluid into the formation, thereby forming the inclusion in a direction of the increased compressive stress.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features, advantages, benefits and objects will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon careful consideration of the detailed description of representative embodiments of the invention hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings, in which similar elements are indicated in the various figures using the same reference numbers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the present invention described herein may be utilized in various orientations, such as inclined, inverted, horizontal, vertical, etc., and in various configurations, without departing from the principles of the present invention. The embodiments are described merely as examples of useful applications of the principles of the invention, which is not limited to any specific details of these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following description of the representative embodiments of the invention, directional terms, such as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, etc., are used for convenience in referring to the accompanying drawings. In general, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;upward&#x201d; and similar terms refer to a direction toward the earth's surface along a wellbore, and &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;downward&#x201d; and similar terms refer to a direction away from the earth's surface along the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a system <b>10</b> and associated method for initiating the forming of one or more generally planar inclusions in a subterranean formation <b>12</b>. The system <b>10</b> and method embody principles of the present invention, but it should be clearly understood that the invention is not limited to any specific features or characteristics of the system or method described below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wellbore <b>14</b> has been drilled into the formation <b>12</b> and has been lined with protective casing <b>16</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;casing&#x201d; refers to any form of protective lining for a wellbore (such as those linings known to persons skilled in the art as &#x201c;casing&#x201d; or &#x201c;liner&#x201d;, etc.), made of any material or combination of materials (such as metals, polymers or composites, etc.), installed in any manner (such as by cementing in place, expanding, etc.) and whether continuous or segmented, jointed or unjointed, threaded or otherwise joined, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Cement or another sealing material <b>18</b> has been flowed into an annulus <b>20</b> between the wellbore <b>14</b> and the casing <b>16</b>. The sealing material <b>18</b> is used to seal and secure the casing <b>16</b> within the wellbore <b>14</b>. Preferably, the sealing material <b>18</b> is a hardenable material (such as cement, epoxy, etc.) which may be flowed into the annulus <b>20</b> and allowed to harden therein in order to seal off the annulus and secure the casing <b>16</b> in position relative to the wellbore <b>14</b>. However, other types of materials (such as swellable materials conveyed into the wellbore <b>14</b> on the casing <b>16</b>, etc.) may be used, without departing from the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the casing <b>16</b> is sealed and secured in the wellbore <b>14</b>, perforations <b>22</b> are formed through the casing and sealing material <b>18</b>. Preferably, the perforations <b>22</b> are formed using a perforating gun <b>24</b> having longitudinally aligned explosive charges <b>26</b>, and the perforations are preferably formed after the casing <b>16</b> is sealed and secured in the wellbore <b>14</b>. However, other methods of forming the perforations <b>22</b> may be used (such as by use of a jet cutting tool, a linear explosive charge, drill, mill, etc.), and other sequences of steps in the method may be used (such as by forming the perforations prior to installation of the casing <b>16</b> in the wellbore <b>14</b>) in keeping with the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A schematic cross-sectional view of the system <b>10</b> after the perforations <b>22</b> are formed is representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this view it may be seen that the perforations <b>22</b> preferably extend somewhat radially beyond the sealing material <b>18</b> and into the formation <b>12</b>. However, it will be appreciated that, if the perforations <b>22</b> are formed through the casing <b>16</b> and/or sealing material <b>18</b> prior to installation of the casing, the perforations may not extend radially into the formation <b>12</b> at all.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Instead, an important benefit of the perforations <b>22</b> in the system <b>10</b> is that the perforations provide for fluid communication between the interior of the casing <b>16</b> and an interface <b>27</b> between the sealing material <b>18</b> and the formation <b>12</b>. This fluid communication can be provided in a variety of configurations and by a variety of techniques, without necessarily forming the perforations <b>22</b> in any particular manner, at any particular time, in any particular arrangement or configuration, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>10</b> is representatively illustrated after a hardenable material <b>28</b> has been injected between the formation <b>12</b> and the sealing material <b>18</b>, thereby forming another annulus <b>30</b> radially outwardly adjacent the annulus <b>20</b>. Preferably, the hardenable material <b>28</b> is flowed from the interior of the casing <b>16</b> to the interface <b>27</b> between the sealing material <b>18</b> and the formation <b>12</b> via the perforations <b>22</b>, but other techniques for injecting the hardenable material and forming the annulus <b>30</b> may be used, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be appreciated that forming the annulus <b>30</b> causes the formation <b>12</b> to be radially outwardly displaced, and thereby radially compressed about the wellbore <b>14</b>. Specifically, compressive stress along radii of the wellbore <b>14</b> (indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by double-headed arrows <b>32</b>) is increased in the formation <b>12</b> surrounding the wellbore as a radial thickness of the annulus <b>30</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hardenable material <b>28</b> is preferably injected into the annulus <b>30</b> under sufficient pressure to form the annulus between the sealing material <b>18</b> and the formation <b>12</b>, and thereby substantially increase the radial compressive stress <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b> about the wellbore <b>14</b>. Note that the wellbore <b>14</b> itself expands radially outward as a radial thickness of the annulus <b>30</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The hardenable material <b>28</b> is preferably a material which hardens and becomes more rigid after being flowed into the annulus <b>30</b>. Cementitious material, polymers (e.g., epoxies, etc.) and other types of materials may be used for the hardenable material <b>28</b>. The hardenable material <b>28</b> could be cement, resin coated sand or proppant, or epoxy coated sand or proppant (such as EXPEDITE&#x2122; proppant available from Halliburton Energy Services of Houston, Tex.). When the material <b>28</b> hardens and becomes more rigid, it is thereby able to radially outwardly support the enlarged wellbore <b>14</b> to maintain the increased compressive stresses <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the well is an existing producer/injector well, then there may be preexisting perforations formerly used to flow fluids between the formation <b>12</b> and the interior of the casing <b>16</b>. In that case, it may be advantageous to squeeze a sealing material into the preexisting perforations prior to forming the perforations <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this manner, the perforations <b>22</b> can be configured, oriented, phased, etc., as desired for subsequent injection of the hardenable material <b>28</b> through the perforations <b>22</b>. For example, a sealing material could be injected into the preexisting perforations to seal them off, and then the perforations <b>22</b> could be formed to allow injection of the hardenable material <b>28</b> into the annulus <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another alternative would be to use the preexisting perforations for the perforations <b>22</b>. That is, the hardenable material <b>28</b> could be injected into the annulus <b>30</b> via the preexisting perforations (which would thus serve as the perforations <b>22</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>), thereby eliminating at least one perforating step in the method.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system <b>10</b> is representatively illustrated after additional perforations <b>34</b> have been formed between the interior of the casing <b>16</b> and the formation <b>12</b> about the wellbore <b>14</b>. The perforations <b>34</b> extend through the casing <b>16</b>, annulus <b>20</b> and annulus <b>30</b> to thereby provide fluid communication between the interior of the casing and the formation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The perforations <b>34</b> may be formed using any of the methods described above for forming the perforations <b>22</b> (e.g., perforating gun, jet cutting tool, drill, linear shaped charge, etc.). Other methods may be used, if desired. If the perforating gun <b>24</b> is used, then preferably the explosive charges <b>26</b> are longitudinally aligned in the perforating gun as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there are two sets of the perforations <b>34</b>, with the sets of perforations being oriented 180 degrees from each other. However, there could be any number of sets of perforations <b>34</b> (including only a single set of perforations), with any number of perforations in each set, and the sets of perforations could be at any angular orientation with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It may be advantageous to form only a single set of the perforations <b>34</b> (e.g., using a so-called &#x201c;zero phase&#x201d; perforating gun). However, in existing gas wells, the inventors postulate that it would be preferable to form four sets of the perforations <b>34</b> (i.e., 90 degree phased), and to subsequently form orthogonally oriented planar inclusions in the formation <b>12</b> (i.e., four inclusions formed in two orthogonal planes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that, after the perforations <b>34</b> are formed, the stresses <b>33</b> in the formation <b>12</b> tangential to the wellbore <b>14</b> are relieved up to the tips <b>46</b> of the perforations. Since the sets of perforations <b>34</b> are longitudinally aligned along the wellbore <b>14</b>, this creates a longitudinally extending region of reduced tangential stress in the formation <b>12</b> corresponding to each set of perforations. This stress state is desirable for orienting and initiating planar inclusions in the formation <b>12</b>, because the inclusions will tend to form as planes normal to the reduced tangential stress <b>33</b> at each set of perforations <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the system <b>10</b> is representatively illustrated after generally planar inclusions <b>36</b> have been formed in the formation <b>12</b> extending radially outward from the perforations <b>34</b>. The planar inclusions <b>36</b> are preferably formed by injecting fluid <b>40</b> from the interior of the casing <b>16</b> and into the formation <b>12</b> via the perforations <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The increased radial compressive stresses <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b> assist in directionally controlling the forming of the inclusions <b>36</b>, since it is known that formation rock will generally part in a direction perpendicular to the minimum principal stress direction. By intentionally increasing the stresses <b>32</b> in a radial direction relative to the wellbore <b>14</b>, the minimum principal stress direction in the formation <b>12</b> about the wellbore is tangential to the wellbore, and thus the formation will at least initially dilate in the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The inclusions <b>36</b> could be formed simultaneously, or they could be formed individually (one at a time), or they could be formed in any sequence or combination. Any number, orientation and combination of inclusions <b>36</b> may be formed in keeping with the principles of the present invention. As discussed above, one alternative is to form four inclusions <b>36</b> along two orthogonal planes (e.g., using four sets of the perforations <b>34</b>), which configuration may be especially preferable for use in existing gas wells. In that case, it may also be preferable to simultaneously inject the fluid <b>40</b> through all four sets of the perforations <b>34</b> to thereby form the four inclusions <b>36</b> simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The formation <b>12</b> could be comprised of relatively hard and brittle rock, but the system <b>10</b> and method find especially beneficial application in ductile rock formations made up of unconsolidated or weakly cemented sediments, in which it is typically very difficult to obtain directional or geometric control over inclusions as they are being formed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Weakly cemented sediments are primarily frictional materials since they have minimal cohesive strength. An uncemented sand having no inherent cohesive strength (i.e., no cement bonding holding the sand grains together) cannot contain a stable crack within its structure and cannot undergo brittle fracture. Such materials are categorized as frictional materials which fail under shear stress, whereas brittle cohesive materials, such as strong rocks, fail under normal stress.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;cohesion&#x201d; is used in the art to describe the strength of a material at zero effective mean stress. Weakly cemented materials may appear to have some apparent cohesion due to suction or negative pore pressures created by capillary attraction in fine grained sediment, with the sediment being only partially saturated. These suction pressures hold the grains together at low effective stresses and, thus, are often called apparent cohesion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The suction pressures are not true bonding of the sediment's grains, since the suction pressures would dissipate due to complete saturation of the sediment. Apparent cohesion is generally such a small component of strength that it cannot be effectively measured for strong rocks, and only becomes apparent when testing very weakly cemented sediments.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Geological strong materials, such as relatively strong rock, behave as brittle materials at normal petroleum reservoir depths, but at great depth (i.e. at very high confining stress) or at highly elevated temperatures, these rocks can behave like ductile frictional materials. Unconsolidated sands and weakly cemented formations behave as ductile frictional materials from shallow to deep depths, and the behavior of such materials are fundamentally different from rocks that exhibit brittle fracture behavior. Ductile frictional materials fail under shear stress and consume energy due to frictional sliding, rotation and displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Conventional hydraulic dilation of weakly cemented sediments is conducted extensively on petroleum reservoirs as a means of sand control. The procedure is commonly referred to as &#x201c;Frac-and-Pack.&#x201d; In a typical operation, the casing is perforated over the formation interval intended to be fractured and the formation is injected with a treatment fluid of low gel loading without proppant, in order to form the desired two winged structure of a fracture. Then, the proppant loading in the treatment fluid is increased substantially to yield tip screen-out of the fracture. In this manner, the fracture tip does not extend further, and the fracture and perforations are backfilled with proppant.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The process assumes a two winged fracture is formed as in conventional brittle hydraulic fracturing. However, such a process has not been duplicated in the laboratory or in shallow field trials. In laboratory experiments and shallow field trials what has been observed is chaotic geometries of the injected fluid, with many cases evidencing cavity expansion growth of the treatment fluid around the well and with deformation or compaction of the host formation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Weakly cemented sediments behave like a ductile frictional material in yield due to the predominantly frictional behavior and the low cohesion between the grains of the sediment. Such materials do not &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; and, therefore, there is no inherent fracturing process in these materials as compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing of strong brittle rocks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Linear elastic fracture mechanics is not generally applicable to the behavior of weakly cemented sediments. The knowledge base of propagating viscous planar inclusions in weakly cemented sediments is primarily from recent experience over the past ten years and much is still not known regarding the process of viscous fluid propagation in these sediments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, the present disclosure provides information to enable those skilled in the art of hydraulic fracturing, soil and rock mechanics to practice a method and system <b>10</b> to initiate and control the propagation of a viscous fluid in weakly cemented sediments. The viscous fluid propagation process in these sediments involves the unloading of the formation in the vicinity of the tip <b>38</b> of the propagating viscous fluid <b>40</b>, causing dilation of the formation <b>12</b>, which generates pore pressure gradients toward this dilating zone. As the formation <b>12</b> dilates at the tips <b>38</b> of the advancing viscous fluid <b>40</b>, the pore pressure decreases dramatically at the tips, resulting in increased pore pressure gradients surrounding the tips.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The pore pressure gradients at the tips <b>38</b> of the inclusions <b>36</b> result in the liquefaction, cavitation (degassing) or fluidization of the formation <b>12</b> immediately surrounding the tips. That is, the formation <b>12</b> in the dilating zone about the tips <b>38</b> acts like a fluid since its strength, fabric and in situ stresses have been destroyed by the fluidizing process, and this fluidized zone in the formation immediately ahead of the viscous fluid <b>40</b> propagating tip <b>38</b> is a planar path of least resistance for the viscous fluid to propagate further. In at least this manner, the system <b>10</b> and associated method provide for directional and geometric control over the advancing inclusions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The behavioral characteristics of the viscous fluid <b>40</b> are preferably controlled to ensure the propagating viscous fluid does not overrun the fluidized zone and lead to a loss of control of the propagating process. Thus, the viscosity of the fluid <b>40</b> and the volumetric rate of injection of the fluid should be controlled to ensure that the conditions described above persist while the inclusions <b>36</b> are being propagated through the formation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the viscosity of the fluid <b>40</b> is preferably greater than approximately 100 centipoise. However, if foamed fluid <b>40</b> is used in the system <b>10</b> and method, a greater range of viscosity and injection rate may be permitted while still maintaining directional and geometric control over the inclusions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The system <b>10</b> and associated method are applicable to formations of weakly cemented sediments with low cohesive strength compared to the vertical overburden stress prevailing at the depth of interest. Low cohesive strength is defined herein as no greater than 400 pounds per square inch (psi) plus 0.4 times the mean effective stress (p&#x2032;) at the depth of propagation.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Examples of such weakly cemented sediments are sand and sandstone formations, mudstones, shales, and siltstones, all of which have inherent low cohesive strength. Critical state soil mechanics assists in defining when a material is behaving as a cohesive material capable of brittle fracture or when it behaves predominantly as a ductile frictional material.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Weakly cemented sediments are also characterized as having a soft skeleton structure at low effective mean stress due to the lack of cohesive bonding between the grains. On the other hand, hard strong stiff rocks will not substantially decrease in volume under an increment of load due to an increase in mean stress.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the art of poroelasticity, the Skempton B parameter is a measure of a sediment's characteristic stiffness compared to the fluid contained within the sediment's pores. The Skempton B parameter is a measure of the rise in pore pressure in the material for an incremental rise in mean stress under undrained conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In stiff rocks, the rock skeleton takes on the increment of mean stress and thus the pore pressure does not rise, i.e., corresponding to a Skempton B parameter value of at or about 0. But in a soft soil, the soil skeleton deforms easily under the increment of mean stress and, thus, the increment of mean stress is supported by the pore fluid under undrained conditions (corresponding to a Skempton B parameter of at or about 1).</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The system <b>10</b> and associated method are applicable to formations of weakly cemented sediments (such as tight gas sands, mudstones and shales) where large entensive propped vertical permeable drainage planes are desired to intersect thin sand lenses and provide drainage paths for greater gas production from the formations. In weakly cemented formations containing heavy oil (viscosity&#x3e;100 centipoise) or bitumen (extremely high viscosity&#x3e;100,000 centipoise), generally known as oil sands, propped vertical permeable drainage planes provide drainage paths for cold production from these formations, and access for steam, solvents, oils, and heat to increase the mobility of the petroleum hydrocarbons and thus aid in the extraction of the hydrocarbons from the formation. In highly permeable weak sand formations, permeable drainage planes of large lateral length result in lower drawdown of the pressure in the reservoir, which reduces the fluid gradients acting toward the wellbore, resulting in less drag on fines in the formation, resulting in reduced flow of formation fines into the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although the present invention contemplates the formation of permeable drainage paths which generally extend laterally away from a vertical or near vertical wellbore <b>14</b> penetrating an earth formation <b>12</b> and generally in a vertical plane in opposite directions from the wellbore, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be carried out in earth formations wherein the permeable drainage paths and the wellbores can extend in directions other than vertical, such as in inclined or horizontal directions. Furthermore, it is not necessary for the planar inclusions <b>36</b> to be used for drainage, since in some circumstances it may be desirable to use the planar inclusions for injecting fluids into the formation <b>12</b>, for forming an impermeable barrier in the formation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an enlarged cross-sectional view of the hardenable material <b>28</b> injected into the annulus <b>30</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is representatively illustrated. In this view it may be seen that the material <b>28</b> can include a mixture or combination of materials which operate to enhance the effect of increasing the radial compressive stresses <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, the hardenable material <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes particles or granules of swellable material <b>42</b> in an overall hardenable material matrix <b>44</b>. The swellable material <b>42</b> may be of the type which swells (increases in volume) when contacted by a particular fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Swellable materials are known which swell in the presence of oil, water or gas. Some appropriate swellable materials are described in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The swellable material may have a considerable portion of cavities which are compressed or collapsed at the surface condition. Then, when being placed in the well at a higher pressure, the material is expanded by the cavities filling with fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This type of apparatus and method might be used where it is desired to expand the material in the presence of gas rather than oil or water. A suitable swellable material is described in International Application No. PCT/NO2005/000170 (published as WO 2005/116394), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Any type of swellable material, any fluid for initiating swelling of the material, and any technique for causing swelling of the swellable material, may be used in the system <b>10</b> and associated method.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Preferably, the material <b>42</b> swells after it is injected into the annulus <b>30</b>, but the material could also swell prior to and during the injection operation. This swelling of the material <b>42</b> in the annulus <b>30</b> operates to increase the radial compressive stresses <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b> surrounding the wellbore <b>14</b> by causing radial outward expansion of the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The matrix <b>44</b> preferably becomes substantially rigid after the material <b>42</b> has completely (or at least substantially completely) swollen to its greatest extent. In this manner, the volumetric increase provided by the material <b>42</b> in the annulus <b>30</b> is &#x201c;captured&#x201d; therein to maintain the increased compressive stresses <b>32</b> in the formation <b>12</b> while further steps in the method are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The system <b>10</b> and associated methods described above may be used for new or preexisting wells.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, an alternate construction of the system <b>10</b> and method is representatively illustrated.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, instead of perforating the casing <b>16</b> and sealing material <b>18</b>, a radially enlarged cavity <b>50</b> is formed through the casing, sealing material, and into the formation <b>12</b>. The cavity <b>50</b> could be formed by underreaming or any other suitable technique.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A sleeve <b>52</b> is then positioned in the casing <b>16</b> straddling the cavity <b>50</b>. Seals <b>54</b> (such as cup packers, expanding metal to metal seals, etc.) at each end of the sleeve <b>52</b> provide pressure isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The hardenable material <b>28</b> is then injected into the cavity <b>50</b> external to the sleeve <b>52</b>. For this purpose, the sleeve <b>52</b> may be equipped with ports, valves, etc. to permit flowing the material <b>28</b> from the interior of the casing <b>16</b> into the cavity <b>50</b>, and then retaining the material in the cavity while it hardens and/or swells (as described above). In this manner, the increased radial compressive stresses <b>32</b> are imparted to the formation <b>12</b> surrounding the cavity <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the system <b>10</b> and method are depicted after the perforations <b>34</b> have been formed through the sleeve <b>52</b>, annulus <b>30</b> and into the formation <b>12</b>. Note that, in this alternate configuration, the perforations <b>34</b> do not extend through the sealing material <b>18</b> in the annulus <b>20</b>, since the annulus <b>30</b> is not positioned exterior to the annulus <b>20</b> (as in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> described above). The perforations <b>34</b> may be formed using the perforating gun <b>24</b> or any of the other methods described above (e.g., jet cutting, drilling, linear explosive charge, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the system <b>10</b> and method are depicted while the fluid <b>40</b> is being pumped through the perforations <b>34</b> and into the formation <b>12</b> to thereby propagate the inclusions <b>36</b> into the formation. This step is essentially the same as described above in relation to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>, another alternate configuration of the system <b>10</b> and associated method is representatively illustrated.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">However, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> uses a specially constructed expandable sleeve assembly <b>56</b>, instead of the perforations <b>34</b>, to initiate formation of the inclusions <b>36</b>. A cross-sectional view of the sleeve assembly <b>56</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this view, it may be seen that the sleeve <b>52</b> in this configuration is parted at a split <b>58</b>, and extensions <b>60</b> extend radially outward on either side of the split.</p>
