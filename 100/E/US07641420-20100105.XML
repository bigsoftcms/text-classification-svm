<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/734,167 filed Nov. 7, 2005, and entitled &#x201c;RESIDENTIAL SEALCOATING MACHINE HAVING CLEANABLE MANIFOLD&#x201d;, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to seal coating machines for applying sealant to an asphalt surface. More specifically, the invention is directed to a towable seal coating machine having a removable distribution manifold for easy cleaning of the manifold following application of the sealant to a residential asphalt surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Asphalt is used for constructing a large percentage of the paved roadways, parking lots and residential driveways in the United States. Asphalt generally comprises a combination of aggregates (crushed stone and sand), filler (cement, hydrated lime or stone dust) and a bituminous binder (called asphalt cement or asphalt binder). When used in construction, asphalt has a number of advantages including smoothness when applied, ease of construction and durability. While asphalt construction has a number of advantages, asphalt can begin to break down due to oxidation, exposure to ultraviolet rays and exposure to oil and gas spills. As such, asphalt maintenance is important and especially so for residential homeowners that can incur significant expense due to damaged asphalt driveways.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The most common form of asphalt maintenance is the application of an asphalt sealant or sealcoat applied in a thin layer directly on the asphalt surface. Application of sealcoat provides a number of benefits including protecting the asphalt from exposure to oxygen and water, preventing ultraviolet rays from penetrating the asphalt, resisting damage caused by oil or gas spills, smoothing the asphalt surface and restoring the original look and color of the asphalt.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Depending upon environmental conditions (sun exposure, temperature variation, amount of moisture) and traffic on the sealcoat, asphalt driveways may require the application of sealcoat every 1 to 3 years. Sealcoat generally comprises a mixture of emulsified asphalt, water, mineral fillers and various other mixtures. Sealcoat can be applied using a squeegee, stiff broom or mechanical sprayers/applicators. Representative sprayers/applicators include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,533,336; 3,703,856; 3,841,779; 3,940,213; 3,989,403; 4,026,658; 4,302,128; 4,315,700; 4,575,279; 4,688,964; 4,831,958; 5,362,178; 5,735,952; 5,549,457; 6,102,615; and 6,290,428, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many homeowners apply sealcoat to their asphalt driveways themselves. While the sealcoating process can be successfully accomplished by homeowners, the process is generally messy and can destroy the brushes and components used in the sealcoating process. As such, it would be advantageous for residential homeowners to have an apparatus allowing for quick and efficient application of sealcoat while allowing for easy cleaning and maintenance of the apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention addresses the aforementioned needs by providing a residential sealcoat applicator apparatus that quickly and efficiently applies sealcoat and is easily cleanable upon completion of the sealcoating process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, a representative embodiment of a sealcoating apparatus comprises a towable implement having a mounting frame, a sealcoat reservoir, a distribution manifold and an applicator member. The sealcoat reservoir can supply sealcoat to the distribution manifold and applicator member at the direction of a supply valve accessible to an operator on a tow vehicle. The applicator member can be vertically adjustable from an upward transport disposition to a downward application disposition through use of a manually adjusted repositionable wheel assembly. The distribution manifold is operably removable so as to allow for cleaning of the distribution manifold following completion of the sealcoating process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, a residential sealcoating process can be accomplished utilizing a towable sealcoating apparatus that is disassemblable for cleaning upon completion of the sealcoating process. The sealcoating process can include supplying liquid sealcoat to an asphalt surface through a distribution manifold that generally evenly distributes sealcoat for application with an applicator member. A repositionable wheel assembly can be adjusted so as to vary the position of the applicator member between an upward transport disposition and a downward application disposition. Upon completion of the sealcoating process, the distribution manifold can be removed and cleaned allowing the towable sealcoating apparatus to be successfully used for subsequent sealcoating applications.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> can be used with a suitable towing implement such as, for example, a lawn tractor <b>200</b> or all-terrain vehicle. Towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> can be used to resurface and sealcoat an asphalt driveway <b>202</b>. For example, towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> can be attached to the lawn tractor <b>202</b> by positioning towing receiver <b>120</b> over a ball hitch on the lawn tractor <b>202</b>. Wheels <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>are generally sized such that attachment of the towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> to the lawn tractor <b>200</b> results in the towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> being tilted such that the towing receiver <b>120</b> is at a higher elevation than the end member <b>116</b>. When towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> is in such tilted orientation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, outlet port <b>136</b> is positioned so as gravity feed sealcoat into the supply portion <b>136</b> of distribution manifold <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, an operator aligns lawn tractor <b>200</b>, and consequently, towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b>, with a portion of the asphalt driveway <b>202</b> in which, sealcoat is to be applied. The operator grasps the positioning arm <b>160</b> and pulls the positioning arm <b>160</b> toward the lawn tractor <b>200</b> which, causes adjustment arm <b>164</b> to pull the attachment arm <b>166</b> forward. As the attachment arm <b>166</b> is pulled toward the lawn tractor <b>200</b>, mounting member <b>130</b> is caused to rotate such that the extension members <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>rotatably direct the wheels <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>toward the end member <b>116</b>. As the extension members <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>are rotated, the ground clearance between the squeegee <b>148</b> and the driveway <b>202</b> is reduced until the squeegee <b>148</b> is in physical contact with the driveway <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operator then opens delivery valve <b>158</b> by pulling delivery lever <b>150</b> toward the lawn tractor <b>200</b> such that the lever arm <b>156</b> actuates the delivery valve <b>158</b> to an open position. As delivery valve <b>156</b> is opened, sealcoat within tank assembly <b>130</b> begins flowing from outlet port <b>134</b> into supply end <b>140</b>, through supply portion <b>136</b>, out distribution end <b>142</b> and into distribution portion <b>138</b> due to the tilted configuration of the towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b>. The sealcoat is flowably dispensed out the distribution bores <b>144</b> and onto the driveway <b>202</b>. The operator directs the lawn tractor <b>200</b> forward such that the squeegee <b>148</b> comes into contact with and evenly spreads the sealcoat on the driveway <b>202</b>. Preferably, squeegee <b>148</b> extends beyond the width of the lawn tractor <b>200</b> such that the operator can do a next pass on the driveway <b>202</b> without driving the lawn tractor <b>200</b> over previously applied sealcoat. Upon completion of the sealcoating process, the operator closes the delivery valve <b>156</b> by directing the delivery lever <b>150</b> away from the lawn tractor <b>200</b> and raises the squeegee <b>148</b> by directing the positioning arm <b>160</b> away from the lawn tractor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the driveway <b>202</b> has been sealcoated, the distribution manifold <b>106</b> can be removed from the tank assembly <b>132</b>, preferably by removing a quick connect or similar style fitting, that connects the supply end <b>142</b> to the outlet port <b>136</b>. This allows for easy access and cleaning of the distribution manifold <b>106</b> and delivery valve <b>158</b> such that the towable sealcoating apparatus <b>100</b> can continue to be reused for subsequent sealcoat applications. In some embodiments, supply portion <b>136</b> and distribution portion <b>140</b> can be detachably removed from the delivery valve <b>158</b> to provide individual cleaning and maintenance access to each component. In addition, portions of the distribution manifold <b>106</b> can comprise flexible tubing/hose allowing for flexibility and quick connection of the components using connectors such as, for example, barbed fittings and/or hose clamps.</p>
