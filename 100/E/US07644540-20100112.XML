<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a door opening/closing apparatus, and in particular to a door opening/closing apparatus for a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some vehicles have a door opening/closing apparatus that operates a sliding door to automatically open/close an opening formed on a side of a vehicle. Some other vehicles have a door opening/closing apparatus that opens/closes an opening formed on a rear of a vehicle. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-10346 discloses a conventional art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, one actuator is provided for each door opening/closing apparatus. Therefore, if the vehicle has a number of doors, then a number of actuators are required and the cost of the vehicle disadvantageously increases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, generally the door opening/closing apparatus of the rear opening is arranged in the roof of the vehicle. However, if the door opening/closing apparatus is arranged in the roof, the roof bulges. This reduces the space inside the vehicle. Moreover, the bulging becomes obstructs when putting in and taking out luggage. Further, when the door opening/closing apparatus is disposed in the roof, a bracket for mounting the door opening/closing apparatus is required, which increases the cost of the vehicle. In addition, when the door opening/closing apparatus is arranged in a roof of a vehicle having a so-called &#x201c;three-row seats (a vehicle where two rows of seats are arranged along a longitudinal direction of the vehicle in a compartment behind a driver's seat)&#x201d;, the head of a passenger or a vehicle occupant sitting on the third row seat is positioned close to a bulging portion of the roof, which obstructs getting in and out of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a cheap and compact door opening/closing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A door opening/closing apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention includes a driving unit; a first door opening/closing mechanism connected to the driving unit via a first clutch; and a second door opening/closing mechanism connected to the driving unit via a second clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are specifically set forth in or will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Exemplary embodiments of a door opening/closing apparatus according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view of a slide door to which a door opening/closing apparatus according to the present invention is applied, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a conceptual view of the slide door shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as viewed downwardly, where the slide door is closed and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a conceptual view of the slide door shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as viewed downwardly, where the slide door is opened, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a view of a back door to which a door opening/closing apparatus according to the present invention is applied, where the back door is closed, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a view of the back door to which the door opening/closing apparatus is applied, where the back door is opened. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of an internal structure of a power unit of a door opening/closing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The door opening/closing apparatus according to the present invention will be explained with an example of a door opening/closing apparatus <b>6</b> which is applied to a slide door <b>3</b> closing an opening <b>2</b> formed in a side of a vehicle <b>1</b> and a back door <b>5</b> closing an opening <b>4</b> formed in a rear of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the slide door <b>3</b> is supported by an upper rail <b>7</b>, a lower rail <b>8</b> and a center rail <b>9</b>. The upper rail <b>7</b> is mounted on an upper edge of the opening <b>2</b> formed in the vehicle <b>1</b>, and the lower rail <b>8</b> is mounted on a lower edge of the opening <b>2</b>. The center rail <b>9</b> is mounted on a side surface of a quarter panel <b>10</b> positioned at a rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The slide door <b>3</b> is provided with an upper bracket <b>11</b>, a lower bracket <b>12</b>, and a center bracket <b>13</b>. The upper bracket <b>11</b> is mounted on a front upper edge of the slide door <b>3</b> and it is slidably engaged with the upper rail <b>7</b>. The lower bracket <b>12</b> is mounted on a front lower edge of the slide door <b>3</b> and it is slidably engaged with the lower rail <b>8</b>. The center bracket <b>13</b> is mounted on a rear central portion of the slide door <b>3</b> on an inner side of a vehicle compartment and it is slidably engaged with the center rail <b>9</b>. Therefore, the slide door <b>3</b> is slidable in a longitudinal direction of a vehicle and it allows opening/closing of the opening <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A latch apparatus <b>14</b> is mounted on a rear edge central portion of the slide door <b>3</b>, and a striker <b>15</b> is mounted on a lower rear edge of the opening <b>2</b>. Therefore, when the slide door <b>3</b> is closed, the latch apparatus <b>14</b> and the striker <b>15</b> are engaged with each other, so that a closed state of the slide door <b>3</b> is maintained. Such a structure may be employed that, while a latch apparatus <b>16</b> is mounted on a front edge central portion of the slide door <b>3</b>, a striker <b>17</b> is mounted on a front edge of the opening <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A full open holder <b>18</b> is mounted on a front lower portion of the slide door <b>3</b>, and a full open striker <b>19</b> is mounted on a lower rear edge of the opening <b>2</b>. Therefore, the slide door <b>3</b> is fully opened, the full open holder <b>18</b> and the full open striker <b>19</b> are engaged with each other, so that a fully opened state of the slide door <b>3</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The back door <b>5</b> is for closing an opening <b>4</b> formed in a rear of the vehicle, and it is supported by hinges <b>20</b> mounted on an upper edge of the opening <b>4</b>. Therefore, the back door <b>5</b> can be opened/closed about the hinges <b>20</b> upward and downward.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A latch apparatus <b>21</b> is mounted on a lower edge central portion of the back door <b>5</b>, and a striker <b>22</b> is mounted at a lower edge central portion of the opening <b>4</b>. Therefore, when the back door <b>5</b> is closed, the latch apparatus <b>21</b> and the striker <b>22</b> are engaged with each other, so that a closed state of the back door <b>5</b> is maintained.</p>
