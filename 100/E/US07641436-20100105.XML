<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to implements for transportation of bales. In particular, the present invention is direct to implements for transporting bales for use with skid loader or skid steer loader vehicles having a bucket or similar lift attachment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Small square bales, for example of hay or straw, are typically gathered by hand onto flat-bed wagons or similar vehicles for transportation to the barn or other location. In addition, even when bale thrower devices are utilized, square bales often fall from the wagon and require manual lifting and positioning on the wagon, receiving vehicle or structure. Such operations require significant manual labor wherein such operations are difficult or impossible with a single person.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">What is needed is a device and method that reduces or eliminates the manual labor required for picking up square bales from the ground and loading them to a wagon or truck. Additionally needed is a device and/or method that enables loading of small square bales onto wagons or other vehicles or structures with a single person and/or in locations having terrain typically requiring manual loading.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first aspect of the present inventions includes a bale tote implement for a skid steer vehicle including an elongated body having a plurality of openings. Each opening is configured to receive one or more fasteners and at least one of the openings is configured to receive a fastener to retain the implement in position on a bucket of the skid steer vehicle. The implement also includes a plurality of substantially hollow gathering teeth having a first end and a second end. The first end is substantially flattened and the second end includes a support dowel inserted therein. Slots are configured to receive the second end of the gathering teeth. U-shaped fasteners are positioned adjacent the second end and through at least two of the openings in the elongated body. The U-shaped fasteners apply a retention force on the second end and the support dowel to retain the teeth in position within the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for loading bales onto a vehicle comprising providing a bale tote implement for a skid steer vehicle having an elongated body having a plurality of openings. Each opening is configured to receive one or more fasteners and at least one of the openings is configured to receive a fastener to retain the implement in position on a bucket of the skid steer vehicle. The implement also includes a plurality of substantially hollow gathering teeth having a first end and a second end. The first end is substantially flattened and the second end includes a support dowel inserted therein. Slots are configured to receive the second end of the gathering teeth. U-shaped fasteners are positioned adjacent the second end and through at least two of the openings in the elongated body. The U-shaped fasteners apply a retention force on the second end and the support dowel to retain the teeth in position within the slots. The skid steer vehicle is operated into close proximity to a square bale. The square bale is lifted onto the teeth and the teeth are directed in a direction urging the square bale toward the bucket of the skid steer vehicle. The skid steer vehicle is operated into close proximity to a receiving vehicle. The bucket is raised to a height substantially above the vehicle and the teeth are lowered to permit the bales to move onto the receiving vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One advantage of the present invention includes the ability to load bales with only one or a few people.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another advantage is that the method of the present invention allows for the loading with few personnel in difficult or extreme terrain, such as hilly terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another advantage is that the implement is attachable to a bucket of a skid steer vehicle by a single fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another advantage is that the implement includes easily replaceable and/or serviceable teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another advantage of the present disclosure is that the implement utilizes teeth that are lightweight and easily maneuverable, even in difficult terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another advantage of the present disclosure is that the implement is sufficiently detachable and lightweight to permit shipping by normal couriers or mail systems.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

For example, the implement <b>101</b> may include any desired space of teeth <b>107</b> for loading of various sized bales <b>501</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Further, the implement <b>101</b> may be smaller or larger than the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The implement <b>101</b> is preferably configured to lift and load square bales <b>501</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), including bales of hay or straw. &#x201c;Square bales&#x201d;, as utilized herein, include bales that are configured into a rectangular elongated cube-like geometry. The teeth <b>107</b> are preferably spaced and configured to lift and/or load small square bales.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a bottom view of the bale tote implement <b>101</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The bale tote implement <b>101</b> is engaged with bucket <b>103</b> of a skid steer vehicle <b>100</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In addition to the features visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the implement <b>101</b> includes slots-forming members <b>201</b> arranged along the support body <b>105</b>. The slots-forming members <b>201</b> are not limited to the structures shown and may include any suitable slot structure. Suitable structures include, but are not limited to, plates, or bars or any other protrusion configurable into a slot to receive an end of a tooth <b>107</b>. The teeth <b>107</b> are retained in position by U-shaped fasteners <b>203</b>. The U-shaped fasteners <b>203</b> are fastened to the support body <b>105</b> by openings that pass through the support body <b>105</b>. In addition, the teeth <b>107</b> include a support dowel <b>301</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that are inserted into the substantially hollow tooth <b>107</b> and support the inner diameter of the tooth <b>107</b> reacting to the retention force applied by the U-shaped fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a bottom view of a bale tote implement <b>101</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

A &#x201c;substantially hollow structure&#x201d;, as utilized herein, includes a structure that is hollow (i.e., contains an open space along the cross-section) for at least a portion along the length. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</figref>, the support dowel <b>301</b> is inserted into the tooth <b>107</b> at the end opposite the tip <b>108</b>. In addition, the tooth <b>107</b> is retained by a U-shaped fastener <b>203</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) adjacent to or substantially adjacent to the end of tooth <b>107</b> having support dowel <b>301</b> inserted therein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the flattened tip <b>108</b> is preferably flattened to include a lifting surface <b>401</b> suitable for lifting and support bales <b>501</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bale tote implement requires manipulation by the operator to provide the advantages provided by the bale tote implement <b>101</b>. While transporting the implement <b>101</b>, empty, the teeth <b>107</b> are slightly elevated from horizontal maintaining a distance between the tips <b>108</b> of teeth <b>107</b> above the terrain to avoid any obstacles. The bale tote implement <b>101</b> may be manipulated to tilt bales <b>501</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) onto one of the edges. Certain baling equipment may eliminate the need for a tilting step, but the alignment of the bales provides the positioning of the bale strings and the bale makeup, such that lifting of the bales <b>501</b> does not damage or distort the bales <b>501</b> prior to positioning of the wagon or other structure. Bales <b>501</b> may be approached from the lower side, if on an incline. In order to load the bale <b>501</b>, the bucket <b>103</b> is slightly raised and the tips <b>108</b> of teeth <b>107</b> are lowered to get under the bale <b>501</b>. The teeth <b>107</b> are raised while the operator directs the skid steer vehicle <b>100</b> slowly forward. Upon loading of the bale <b>501</b>, the teeth <b>107</b> are lifted such that the bale <b>501</b> is tossed back or otherwise urged into the bucket, making room for additional bales <b>501</b>. The process may be repeated for multiple bales <b>501</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In certain terrain, particularly hilly operations, at least four (4) bales may be loaded with the implement <b>101</b> without manual labor assistance. Unloading to a wagon bed, truck or other structure is preferably performed downgrade or level from the skid steer vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The implement <b>101</b> of the present invention includes a structure that is easily repaired. For example, teeth <b>107</b>, which are subject to damage, may be easily repaired or replaced. In addition, the implement <b>101</b> may be repaired in the field without the need for specialized or complicated tools. Teeth <b>107</b> may be repaired by simple straightening if bent. In addition, the teeth <b>107</b> may be removed and replaced in the field by loosing of the U-shaped fasteners <b>203</b> and removal and replacement of the teeth <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further still, in one embodiment of the present disclosure the implement is sufficiently detachable and lightweight to permit shipping by normal couriers or mail systems. As such, for example, the implement may be shipped to distributors via routine mail or courier routes for assembly prior to distribution.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An example of a bale tote implement was fabricated using steel. The implement includes a steel bar having the following dimensions 50&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033;&#xd7;&#xbd;&#x2033; with eight 5/16&#x2033; holes drilled to receive 4 5/16&#x2033; U-bolts. In addition, in the center of the steel bar a &#xbd;&#x2033; hole was drilled for mounting to the skid-steer cutting blade bucket. A matching hole was bored in the blade of the skid-steer bucket with a welding torch to match the &#xbd;&#x2033; hole. A &#xbd;&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033; steel fastening bolt was passed through the &#xbd;&#x2033; hole and provided attachment of the implement to the bucket. Eight &#x215c;&#x2033;&#xd7;&#xbd;&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033; steel bar segments were welded to the bottom of the 50&#x2033; bar to provide stability and strength to the attachment of the four gathering teeth. Two &#x215c;&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x2033;&#xd7;3&#x2033; steel plates were welded to the top of the 50&#x2033; steel bar 4&#x2033; from the outside edge of the bar. These plates frictionally engage the skid-steer cutting blade bucket and support the implement. The four gathering teeth consist of light-weight steel tubing 1.160&#x2033; inner diameter 42&#x2033; long that are flattened in a hydraulic press to create an easy entry under the bales as they lay in the field. A 4&#x2033; support dowel was inserted into the non-flattened end of the tooth. The dowel was fabricated from wood, wherein the diameter was maintained to provide a, tight frictional fit within the tooth. U-bolts were tightened over each of the teeth around the end having the support dowel.</p>
