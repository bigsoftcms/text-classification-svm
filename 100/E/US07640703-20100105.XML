<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to canopies, and, more particularly, to a demountable and reusable canopy which may be installed over an area to be protected from the weather, disassembled without leaving any portion of the canopy exposed above the grade level of the ground and then reassembled, if desired, at a later time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Canopies are commonly employed to protect individuals, equipment, vehicles, furniture and other items from rain and other elements. Depending on the area to be protected, canopies can take the form of a covered walkway, a storage shed, a pavilion, a carport, a patio enclosure and a variety of other units for covering a particular area. For example, covered walkways are frequently employed to protect individuals from rain and the like while walking in between buildings or from a parking lot into a building and the like. Sidewalks connecting different buildings on the campus of schools may be protected by covered walkways so that the children can move from class-to-class during the school day while being shielded from the rain. Storage sheds, carports, patio enclosures and similar units with a roof but no side walls are commonly use to afford protection of equipment, vehicles, furniture and other items from rain, leaves, falling branches and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Historically, canopies in the form of a covered walkway comprise a number of pairs of vertical posts wherein one post of each pair is located on one side of a sidewalk or other area to be covered and the other post in such pair is positioned in alignment with the first post on the opposite side of the sidewalk. Adjacent pairs of posts are spaced from one another in the direction the sidewalk extends. One end of each post is embedded in a concrete footer located in the ground in position along the side of the sidewalk. Once the posts are mounted to a concrete footer, they are permanently in place and cannot be moved without digging up the footers which is a time consuming, difficult and expensive proposition. Consequently, once a covered walkway of this type is in place it usually remains there unless damaged and can create an obstruction to the movement of equipment, materials and the like through the area occupied by the walkway.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The posts extend upwardly from the footers to the desired height of the walkway. A beam spans each pair of posts in a direction transverse to the walkway, and decking is attached to adjacent beams to form the &#x201c;roof&#x201d; of the walkway. Typically, each end of the beam is welded to one of the posts it spans. One method currently in use is to weld a bolt plate on the inside of each post and mechanically connect the beam to such bolt plate by fasteners, e.g. bolts, self-tapping screws or the like. Alternatively, a bent or angle is welded to both the post and beam to secure them together. The beams and posts of covered walkways are usually formed of extruded aluminum which is light weight, weather resistant and relatively strong. However, one issue with aluminum is that it is weakened when exposed to the heat required for welding. As such, the connections between the beam and posts in prior designs negatively affects the strength and durability of the walkway.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The same general construction described above is also employed for canopies in the form of pavilions, storage sheds, carports, patio enclosures and the like, except that the posts may not be arranged in pairs. Depending on the size and shape of the area to be covered, and/or the presence of obstructions in or around such area, the posts may be staggered from one another or otherwise arranged in some other non-uniform pattern rather than in pairs. The beams are fitted onto the posts, and the decking is mounted to the beams, in the same manner noted above. Nevertheless, and regardless of whether the canopy forms a covered walkway or other type of enclosure, all known canopies suffer from the problems described above, e.g. the posts remain permanently in place above ground thus preventing the canopy from being taken apart and reused, and, the aluminum forming the posts and beams is weakened as a result of welds at the connection points between the posts and beams.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inability for canopies employed in the prior art to be reused is of great concern to a variety of potential customers such as school systems, companies, municipalities and the like. In many instances a canopy is needed for a one-time event, for an event that is held periodically, for temporary storage or for other situations wherein it is desirable to remove the canopy after it is used and then reuse the canopy for the same purpose or a different purpose at a later date. Canopies employing posts which are embedded within buried footers and remain permanently in place cannot accommodate such needs, and, as a result, are not cost effective for many potential customers. There is therefore a need for a more versatile canopy, which also eliminates weakening of the connection point between beams and posts due to welding.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention is directed to a canopy which is demountable and reusable in the sense that it may be assembled, disassembled except for a portion of the canopy which remains underground below finish grade, and then reassembled, if desired, at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the presently preferred embodiment, a number of vertical supports are provided and arranged according to the size and shape of the area to be covered. Each vertical support comprises an insert tube secured within a footer placed in the ground, and a post having a hollow interior which receives an exposed portion of the insert tube. The insert tube and post of each vertical support are connected together by fasteners such as bolts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The posts are provided with a number of screw cases or bosses which extend along their entire length. The screw cases add rigidity to the posts, and provide structure for mounting a beam at the top of the posts thus eliminating the need for welding an angle or a bolt plate to the post and/or beam. This feature of the present invention avoids weakening of the aluminum which forms the posts and beams, in contrast to prior art designs. Decking sections are secured to the beams in between adjacent vertical supports to complete the canopy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Unlike prior designs, the construction of the canopy of this invention permits it to be assembled, disassembled and then reassembled at a later time. The insert tube of each vertical support is preferably located below the finish grade of the ground and remains permanently in place. If the canopy must be disassembled for any reason, the decking sections and beams are taken apart and removed from the posts, and the posts are disconnected from the insert tubes. Earth is then placed over the insert tubes to cover them up, level with the finish grade of the surrounding ground. In the event it is desired to reconstruct the canopy, the insert tubes are uncovered and reconnected to the posts in the same manner as the original canopy.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The construction of the canopy of this invention allows it to be employed by customers for a recurring use, or a different use, without creating a permanent obstruction of posts protruding from the ground as in prior art canopies. As noted above, the insert tube portion of each vertical support remains below ground when the canopy is disassembled. The canopy may be reassembled at that location by uncovering the insert tubes, or, alternatively, the posts, beams and decking of the canopy may be assembled with new footers and insert tubes at a different location, for the same type of application or a totally different one, at a later date. This multiple use feature of the present invention is highly desirable and a distinct improvement over existing designs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to the Figs., alternative embodiments of canopies according to the teachings of this invention are illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> depict canopies in the form of a covered walkway, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is intended to demonstrate that the canopy of this invention may be employed to cover an area of essentially any size and shape for applications such as storage sheds, pavilions, carports, patio enclosures and the like. Structural elements which are common to all embodiments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative means of connecting vertical elements of the canopy herein, as described in detail below. For purposes of the present discussion, the terms &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and the like used in the following description refer to the orientation of the canopies depicted in the Figs.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Considering initially <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a canopy <b>10</b> in the form of a covered walkway comprises a number of vertical supports <b>12</b>, a number of beams <b>14</b> and a number of decking sections <b>16</b>. For purposes of illustration, the covered walkway <b>10</b> is shown with a cut-away portion of the decking sections <b>16</b> overlying a sidewalk <b>18</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, the vertical supports <b>12</b> are arranged in pairs, one on either side of the sidewalk <b>18</b>, and adjacent pairs of vertical supports <b>12</b> are spaced from one another in the longitudinal direction, e.g. the direction in which the sidewalk <b>18</b> extends. Each vertical support <b>12</b> comprises a footer <b>20</b>, an insert tube <b>22</b> and a post <b>24</b>. The footer <b>20</b> of each vertical support includes a body of concrete <b>26</b> which varies in dimension according to the length of the posts <b>24</b>, the spacing between adjacent posts <b>24</b> and other engineering considerations. Typically, the body of concrete <b>26</b> is no less than 30 inches deep, 30 inches wide and 30 inches long, within which a blockout <b>28</b> is embedded. The blockout <b>28</b> receives the lower portion of the insert tube <b>22</b> and is filled with concrete flush with the top of the remainder of the concrete <b>26</b> forming the footer <b>20</b> to firmly and permanently secure the insert tube <b>22</b> within the footer <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an upper, exposed portion <b>30</b> of the insert tube <b>22</b> protrudes outwardly from the footer <b>20</b>. Preferably, the insert tube <b>22</b> is approximately 24 inches in length, with about half of it embedded within the concrete filling the blockout <b>28</b> and the other half forming the exposed portion <b>30</b>. The footer <b>20</b> is located within the ground <b>32</b> to a depth such that the top of the exposed portion <b>30</b> of the insert tube <b>22</b> remains below the level of the finish grade <b>34</b> of the ground <b>32</b>, e.g. on the order of approximately 2-3 inches below such finish grade <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the insert tube <b>22</b> and post <b>24</b> of each vertical support <b>12</b> are shown in detail. Each insert tube <b>22</b> is preferably formed of aluminum in an extrusion operation with opposed side walls <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> and opposed end walls <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. The side walls <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and end walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are connected to one another by a transition area <b>44</b> at each corner of the insert tube <b>22</b>, forming a hollow interior <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each post <b>24</b> is generally square in shape having an outer wall <b>48</b> defined by opposed side sections <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> connected to opposed end sections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> to form a hollow interior <b>58</b>. Two screw bosses or cases <b>60</b> are located at each of the end sections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> of the posts <b>24</b>. In the presently preferred embodiment, the posts <b>24</b> are fabricated of aluminum in an extrusion operation with the screw cases <b>60</b> being integrally formed along the entire length of the end sections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> of the posts <b>24</b>. The screw cases <b>60</b> are spaced from one another along each end section <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, and are spaced from the side sections <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> forming a cavity <b>61</b> within the hollow interior <b>58</b> of the posts <b>24</b> at each corner. Each screw case <b>60</b> includes a first arm <b>62</b> and a second arm <b>64</b> with a bore <b>66</b> formed between them. The first and second arms <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> gradually curve toward one another as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and their ends are separated by a space <b>68</b>. The screw cases <b>60</b> greatly enhance the structural rigidity of the posts <b>24</b>, thus allowing the posts to have a relatively thin wall thickness, e.g. on the order of 0.125 inches, without sacrificing strength or durability. Additionally, as discussed in detail below, the screw cases <b>60</b> mount the beams <b>14</b> without the need for welding.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the insert tube <b>22</b> of each vertical support <b>12</b> is received within the hollow interior <b>58</b> of a post <b>24</b> such that the transition area <b>44</b> at each of the four corners of the insert tube <b>22</b> is captured within a cavity <b>61</b> at each corner of a post <b>24</b>. The post <b>24</b> covers the entire exposed portion <b>30</b> of the insert tube <b>22</b> and rests against the top of the footer <b>20</b>. Preferably, the post <b>24</b> are connected to the exposed portion <b>30</b> of an insert tube <b>22</b> with bolts, screws or other suitable removable fastener <b>69</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment of the canopy <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, each vertical support <b>12</b> within a pair, located on either side of the sidewalk <b>18</b>, mounts one end of a beam <b>14</b>. As discussed above, the practice of welding a bolt plate or angle employed in prior walkways resulted in a weakening of the beam and/or post. This problem is overcome in the present invention by the provision of the screw cases <b>60</b> in the posts <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a self-tapping screw <b>70</b> passes through the bottom wall <b>72</b> of a beam <b>14</b> and into the bore <b>66</b> of each screw case <b>60</b>. When the screws <b>70</b> are tightened down, the beam <b>14</b> is securely mounted atop the post <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the beams <b>14</b> in place on the vertical supports <b>12</b>, the decking sections <b>16</b> may be added to complete the canopy <b>10</b>. One decking section <b>16</b> extends in the longitudinal direction between two adjacent beams <b>14</b>. Preferably, the decking sections <b>16</b> are mounted by screws, bolts or other removable fasteners <b>74</b> to the top wall <b>76</b> of the beams <b>14</b>. For purposes of illustration, the joint formed by abutting decking sections <b>16</b> along the length of a beam <b>14</b> is shown covered by a rain cap <b>80</b> but the details of same form no part of this invention and are therefore not discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some installations, the canopy of this invention must be positioned along side of a building. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a canopy <b>90</b> is shown wherein only a single vertical support <b>12</b> is employed and the beam <b>14</b> is connected directly to the side <b>92</b> of a building <b>94</b>, represented schematically in the drawing. A sidewalk <b>18</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for purposes of illustration, but it should be understood that the canopy <b>90</b> could cover any other area and function, for example, as a carport or storage area. Details of the construction of the canopy <b>90</b> are otherwise the same as in canopy <b>10</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Still other applications do not permit the use of two vertical supports <b>12</b> mounted side-by-side as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A portion of a building or other obstruction may prevent the installation of one of the vertical supports <b>12</b> within a pair. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, these types of situations call for a canopy <b>96</b> which comprises a single vertical support <b>12</b> and a brace <b>98</b> connected between the post <b>24</b> and beam <b>14</b> so that the beam <b>14</b> is cantilevered with respect to the vertical support <b>12</b>. The brace <b>98</b> is preferably secured to both the post <b>24</b> and beam <b>14</b> with removable fasteners such as bolts (not shown). As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a sidewalk <b>18</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for purposes of illustration but the canopy <b>96</b> could cover any other area. Details of the construction of the canopy <b>96</b> are otherwise the same as in canopies <b>10</b>, and <b>90</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, schematic depictions are provided of alternative canopy constructions according to this invention. Except as described below, such canopies have the same detailed construction as those described above in connection with a discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a canopy <b>100</b> is illustrated which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but wherein the beams <b>14</b> extend in the longitudinal direction in between adjacent vertical supports <b>12</b>, i.e. in the direction of the sidewalk <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rather than in the transverse direction. Consequently, the decking <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> extends at an angle of 90&#xb0; to the direction of the decking <b>16</b> in the canopy <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The vertical supports <b>12</b> are depicted in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is a plan view of the canopy <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is illustrative of a canopy <b>102</b> intended to demonstrate that an area of essentially any size and shape may be covered by the canopy construction of this invention. In this embodiment, the location of vertical supports <b>12</b> and beams <b>14</b>, both shown in phantom lines in this plan view, are dictated by the shape of the area to be covered. The vertical supports <b>12</b> are not arranged in pairs and in some locations are staggered or offset from one another. Beams <b>14</b> connect to the vertical supports <b>12</b>, in the same manner as discussed above, and decking <b>15</b> is affixed atop the beams <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The demountable, reusable canopies <b>10</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> of this invention provide a number of advantages over prior designs. Only the insert tube <b>22</b> is permanently mounted to the footer <b>20</b> because there is a mechanical connection, e.g. bolts, screws or the like, between the insert tube <b>22</b> and post <b>24</b>. As a result, the posts <b>24</b> may be easily removed from the insert tubes <b>22</b> to permit disassembly of the canopies. Because the insert tubes <b>22</b> are located below the finish grade <b>34</b> of the ground <b>32</b>, they may be covered up with earth, level with the finish grade <b>34</b>, and hidden from view when the canopies are disassembled. If it is ever desired to reassemble a canopy, the insert tubes <b>22</b> are uncovered allowing the assembly operation described above to proceed. In addition to the ease of assembly, disassembly and reassembly provided by the canopies of this invention, the screw cases <b>60</b> of the posts <b>24</b> add strength and durability because they eliminate the need for welded connections between the posts <b>24</b> and beams <b>16</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, each of the vertical supports <b>12</b> for use with the canopies <b>10</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> has been described as including an insert tube <b>22</b> and a post <b>24</b> with cross sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is contemplated that an alternative construction of vertical supports <b>104</b> could be employed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the insert tube <b>22</b> and post <b>24</b> of vertical supports <b>12</b> may be replaced by a lower post segment <b>106</b> and an upper post segment <b>108</b> joined together by an insert <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, the lower post segment <b>106</b> is embedded within the footer <b>20</b> in the same manner as insert tube <b>22</b> and extends to a point below the finish grade <b>34</b> of the ground <b>32</b>. The upper post segment <b>108</b> butts against the lower post segment <b>106</b> and these two elements are mounted to one another by the insert <b>110</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the insert <b>110</b> extends within the interior of both the lower and upper post segments <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and is connected to them by bolts <b>112</b>. Other types of coupling elements besides the insert <b>110</b> may be employed to connect the two post segments <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> together, e.g. a collar (not shown) extending around the outside surfaces of both segments <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and spanning the butt joint between the two, and the insert <b>110</b> or other coupling element may be secured to the post segments <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> by other suitable means instead of bolts <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
