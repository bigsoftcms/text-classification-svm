<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A guide piece, for connecting the fixing region of a guide rail to the door frame of a vehicle door, whereby the guide piece may be fixed in the external skin thereof, houses a fixing means and the fixing region of the guide rail which may be adjusted in the direction of the vehicle transverse axis (Y-axis) within the guide piece. The guide piece with fixing clips in slots in the external skin can be adjusted in the direction of the vehicle longitudinal axis (X-axis) as required, relative to the external skin of the door frame and may be pre-positioned on the fixing region of the guide rail with a positive fit. The guide piece is embodied in two pieces and comprises a cover which may be connected to a baseplate, between which a part of the fixing means is positively fitted and a part of the fixing region of the guide rail is adjustably arranged perpendicular to the plane of the vehicle door (Y-axis).</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Phase Patent Application of International Application Number PCT/DE2003/003674, filed on Oct. 29, 2003, which claims priority of German Patent Application Number 102 50 998.0, filed on Oct. 30, 2002 and of German Utility Model Number 202 19 264.4, filed on Dec. 6, 2002.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a device for connecting the fixing region of a guide rail to the door body of a vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From the German Patent Application No. 196 11 074 A1 a frameless vehicle door is known having a cable window lifter which can be adjusted transversely to the plane of the window pane and whose guide rails are connected by their upper fixing region to the door body wherein this region is designed sufficiently elastic so that the adjusting region can be readily compensated by a few angular degrees. The lower fixing region of the guide rail is provided with an adjusting and fixing angle which has an oblong hole which defines the adjusting region of the guide rail transversely to the plane of the window pane. Once it has been adjusted the position of the guide rail is fixed by means of a screw connection. The holding angle is thereby drawn firmly against the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the event however that a gap exists between the fixing angle of the guide rail and the associated fixing point on the side of the door body the curved guide rail is correspondingly stretched so that the pull-down radius for the window pane is increased. On the other hand if the fixing angle under tension stands out on the fixing point on the door body side this then results in a more marked curvature of the guide rail which reduces the pull-down radius. In both cases unacceptable changes to the running of the window pane occur which leads in particular to increased friction during movement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disadvantages described can indeed be overcome by avoiding the manufacturing and assembly tolerances but this considerably increases the production costs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the European Patent Application No. 0 626 283 A1 a vehicle door is known having a door body in which at least a guide rail is mounted which is connected at one end to a fixing angle and is held in position on the door body. The fixing angle interacts with a retaining block fixed on the door body and with a securing plate which holds a foot section of the fixing angle above secured against rotation and is guided displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle on a support face of the retaining block underneath. Two longitudinally extending downwardly aligned guide webs are provided on the securing plate spaced from each other to interact with lateral edge sections of the contact bearing face of the retaining block and fix the securing plate in the transverse direction of the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Adjusting and fixing the guide rail in the X and Y directions is carried out by means of a nut provided on the foot section of the fixing angle and in which the fixing screw can be turned from below whereby recesses on the retaining block and the securing plate are made substantially larger than the outer diameter of the fixing screw. The movably mounted fixing screw is however difficult to find from the outside surface area of the door body since it is disposed in an area which cannot be seen. Furthermore it is necessary to provide a retaining block in the door body which increases the assembly costs and requires further tolerances to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">From the U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,942 a window lifter is known whose guide rail is able to pivot about a rotational axis mounted in the region of the door sill and is adjustable in the direction of the vehicle transverse axis or Y-axis by means of an adjusting device which is mounted in the region of the door body and is accessible from outside of the door body so that the fully extended window pane adjoins flush against an upper door or body seal. With the adjusting device known from the International Patent Application Publication number 98/16709 the adjustment in the direction of the Y-axis is additionally restricted by an oblong hole which runs transversely to the plane of the window pane.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An adjusting device known from the German Patent Application No. 44 35 008 A1 has a guide rail of the window lifter assembly running inside the door body and able to pivot about an upper rotational point in the transverse direction of the vehicle where it can be locked by means of the adjusting device engaging in the lower region of the guide rail in such a position that the edge region of the door window pane bears against an adjoining sealing body under pretension. In order to adjust the door window pane without dismantling the door inside trim the guide rail can be moved by its lower end in a transverse direction to the door window pane in a displacement guide and can be fixed by means of fixing elements which are accessible from the underneath side of the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object of the present invention is to provide a device of the kind mentioned at the beginning which guarantees a simple tension-free fitting of the guide rail in the door body of a vehicle door even taking into consideration large tolerances with the adjustment accessible from outside of the door body and fixing of the guide rail, which enables universal use for different models of vehicles and which requires no additional parts which have to be permanently connected to the door body of a vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This is achieved in a first variation according to the invention through a guide part which can be inserted in the external surface area of the door body, can be connected to the latter and holds the fixing means and the fixing region of the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This first variation of the solution ensures a simple fitting of the guide rail in the door body of a vehicle door with an adjustment and fixing of the guide rail accessible from outside of the door body without additional parts which are to be permanently connected to the door body of a vehicle door, a tension-free fitting of the guide rail even when taking into consideration great tolerances and universal use for different vehicle models.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This first variation enables a pre-fitting of the fixing region of the guide rail with a guide part which serves for the connection between the guide rail and the door body of the vehicle door and thus enables the provision of an assembly unit which enables a quick and easy fitting at the site of the connection of the guide rail to the door body of a vehicle door. This connection of the fixing region of the guide rail to the outer surface area of the door body provides the pre-requirement and basis for a self-adjustment of the guide rail without torsion or tensioning forces acting on the guide rail and thus a tension-free connection of the guide rail to the door body of the vehicle door. This tension-free connection is also obtained during actuation of the fixing means to fix the guide rail on the door body since the guide part is intended and designed to divert the tensioning forces and any torque which may arise directly into the door body without the guide rail thereby becoming strained.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order that the guide rail can be adjusted in the Y-direction of the vehicle the fixing region of the guide rail can be displaced in the direction of the vehicle transverse axis (Y-axis) inside the guide part.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Where necessary and depending on the useful site of the guide part the guide part can be displaced in the direction of the vehicle longitudinal axis (X-axis) opposite the outer surface area of the door body and thus can enable a compensation in the direction of the X-axis or form a fixed stop in the X-direction whereby the guide part can be pre-positioned, preferably with positive engagement, on the fixing region of the guide rail and holds at least a part of the fixing means with positive locking engagement so that a simple assembly is possible during manufacture of the pre-assembly unit of guide rail and guide part which enables a suitable pre-adjustment or a basic adjustment such that a sufficient tolerance compensation is guaranteed both in the direction of the X-axis and in the direction of the Y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The in particular positive-locking hold of at least a part of the fixing means ensures that the fixing means for fixing the guide rail on the door body of a vehicle door are arranged secured against rotation and secured against loss. The need for welding a fixing means onto the fixing region of a guide rail or onto the door body no longer applies.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The guide part which is formed as a moulded plastics part in the manner of a cassette is preferably in two parts and has a cover which can be connected to a base plate which are connected together through a hinge, preferably a film hinge, and between which a part of the fixing means is mounted with positive locking engagement and a part of the fixing region of the guide rail is mounted adjustable perpendicular to the plane of the vehicle door (Y-axis).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Through the two-part design of the guide part with a cover connected to a base plate through a hinge, preferably through a film hinge, between which a part of the fixing means is mounted with positive locking engagement and a part of the fixing region of the guide rail is mounted displaceable perpendicular to the plane of the vehicle door (Y-axis) the guide part adopts the form of a cassette which guides the guide rail over its adjusting path so that the guide can be set up exactly relative to the rotational point of the rail. The design of the guide part as a moulded plastics part enables a simple manufacture for example through injection moulding and a simple pre- and final assembly since the fixing means and the fixing region of the guide rail have only to be inserted into the opened guide part and the guide part to be closed by connecting the cover to the base plate so that it can be prefitted in this state on the fixing region of the guide rail and supplied as such for final assembly in a vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment the guide part has a convex stop directed to a side edge of the fixing region of the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The arrangement of a convex stop on the guide part enables the fixing region of the guide rail to automatically assume a position in which no torque acts on the guide rail, i.e. no twisting of the guide rail can take place.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The connection between the base plate and cover of the guide part preferably takes place through positive locking and connecting elements whereby a positive locking element protrudes from a raised surface of the cover and when the guide part is closed engages in an opening in the base plate matching the cross-sectional shape of the positive locking element whilst a connecting element has a closing clip protruding towards the inside of the cover to engage when the guide part is closed in a closing opening of the base plate of the guide part to connect the cover and base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to be able to position the guide rail in a nominal position without aids the guide part has a pre-adjusting element which can be positively connected to the fixing region of the guide rail and which consists of a detent element which is connected to the cover or to the base plate of the guide part and which is connected with positive engagement to a counter detent element of the fixing region of the guide rail. The special configuration of the pre-adjusting element ensures easy release of the connection between the guide part and the fixing region of the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to connect the guide part to the outer surface area of the door body fixing clips protrude from the base plate of the guide part to engage in slots which run parallel to the X-axis and have a length corresponding to the adjustment in the direction of the X-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fixing clips enable positioning and temporary fixing of the guide part on the outer surface area of the door body and thus ensure an anti-rotational lock of the guide rail when torque is exerted on the fixing means since torque is introduced directly through the guide part and fixing clips into the door body thereby preventing twisting of the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore the length of the slots provided in the outer surface area to receive the fixing clips can be varied and thus either cause the guide part to be fixed in the direction of the X-axis or enable a compensation in the X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">More particularly the fixing means can consist of a fixing screw connected to the guide part and of a fixing nut which can be screwed onto the thread of the fixing screw from outside of the outer surface area of the door body, whereby the head of the fixing screw is inserted with positive locking engagement into a screw head socket of the cover of the guide part.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The guide part thus supports the fixing screw secured against loss in the preassembled position and ensures an anti-rotational lock of the fixing screw when the fixing means is tightened for example by screwing a fixing nut onto the fixing screw, without the fixing screw having to be secured in some other way, for example by welding on the screw head. This enables a simple insertion of the fixing screw in the guide part without additional fixing measures.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For an easy adjustment of the guide rail an adjusting lever is provided which protrudes from the fixing region of the guide rail, engages through an opening provided in the outer surface area of the door body and can be operated from outside the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The guide rail or the fixing region of the guide rail or a fixing element connected to the guide rail together with the guide part with the fixing means inserted therein preferably form one pre-assembled unit which can be supplied to the assembly site and inserted there into a vehicle door and then connected easily to the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a second variation the problem underlying the invention is solved according to the invention through a guide part which is prefitted on the fixing region of the guide rail and is connectable to the door body and receives a first part of the multi-part fixing means, through a device for aligning the fixing region of the guide rail relative to the guide part and to the door body at least in the direction of the vehicle transverse axis (Y-axis), and a second part of the fixing means for producing a clamping connection between the fixing region of the guide rail and the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">This variation also ensures a simple tension-free assembly of the guide rail in the door body of a vehicle door even taking into account greater tolerances with an adjustment and fixing of the guide rail which is accessible from outside the door body and is both reproducible and variable in the transverse direction of the vehicle, enables a universal use for different models of vehicles and requires no additional parts which have to be permanently connected to the door body of a vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Through the ability to pre-fit the guide part on the fixing region of the guide rail the guide part can be attached secured against loss together with a part of the fixing means to the guide rail and can thus be supplied together with the window lifter as one unit to the assembly site. During assembly the guide part which is prefitted on the fixing region of the guide rail serves both as an adjusting gauge and positioning aid as well as for holding of a part of the fixing means secured against loss so that the adjusting of the guide rail can be changed and reproduced at any time in the transverse direction of the vehicle to ensure an exact lowering of the window pane, and the fixing means which can be inserted through the door body and thus through a region which is not directly in the line of sight ensures an easy and secure fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the guide part which is prefitted on the fixing region of the guide rail can be connected to the door body the connecting forces which arise during connection between the fixing region of the guide rail and the door body are not transferred to the guide rail but are introduced directly into the door body and thus into the vehicle door and thus produce a secure clamp-fit connection between the guide rail and the door body after the guide rail has been aligned in the transverse direction of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For further simplification of the manufacture and assembly of the guide part the guide part is formed in one piece and is connected on the side of the fixing region of the guide rail remote from the door body to the fixing region of the guide rail with positive locking engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The one-piece design of the guide part requires that the guide part can be made from any material, preferably however from plastics, and needs no connecting elements for example in the form of film hinges or the like as in the case of a multi-part guide part. Thus there is also a greater freedom in design so that the guide part can be provided where required with a glass fibre reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The positive locking connection between the guide part and the fixing region of the guide rail on the side of the fixing region of the guide rail remote from the door body ensures that the clamping faces of the fixing region and the door body rest on each other directly and thus in particular without any intermediate adhesive layer on the guide part, and are thus connected together with force-locking engagement. The one-piece design of the guide part and its positive locking connection with the fixing region of the guide rail in fact enables the guide part to be manufactured for different shapes and thicknesses of guide rails and their fixing regions since the positive locking hold can be provided with a larger play because this play does not have any effect on the connection of the guide rail to the door body of the vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An advantageous development of the solution according to the invention is characterised in that a part of the fixing means is pushed through a slot opening in the fixing region of the guide rail running in the direction of the vehicle transverse axis or Y-axis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The slot opening provided in the fixing region enables in simple manner adjustment of the guide rail in the vehicle transverse direction or Y-direction of the vehicle whereby the pre-positioning of the guide part on the fixing region of the guide rail and its connection to the door body enables easy insertion of the fixing means. The part of the multi-part fixing means mounted secured against loss in the guide part can thereby be pushed through the slot opening of the fixing region and through a corresponding opening in the door body or can be pushed from outside the door body through the opening in the door body and the slot opening in the fixing region of the guide rail and connected to the part of the multi-part fixing means mounted in the guide part.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fixing region of the guide rail preferably has a contact bearing face and edge zones angled from the contact bearing face and running parallel to the slot opening in order to engage round the clip-like studs of the guide part which can be inserted in positioning openings in the door body.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The edge zones of the fixing region of the guide rail which are angled from the contact bearing face and run parallel to the slot opening enable simple displacement of the fixing region relative to the guide part and thus an easy alignment of the guide rail for a tension-free lowering of the window pane. The clip-like studs of the guide part which can be inserted in positioning openings of the door body and engage round the angled edge zones ensure on the one hand the positive locking connection between the guide part and fixing region of the guide rail and on the other hand a positive locking connection between the guide part and the door body of the vehicle door before aligning the guide rail with subsequent force-locking connection of the fixing region of the guide rail with the door body of the vehicle door. The clip-like studs of the guide part which engage with positive locking connection in the door openings of the door body ensure an anti-rotational lock of the guide part during actuation of the fixing means for the force-locking connection of the fixing region of the guide rail with the door body of the vehicle door as well as for the pre-positioning and pre-fixing of the guide rail on the door body of the vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With a double-strand window lifter an automatic X-compensation in the assembly phase is guaranteed. The clip-like studs of the guide part connected to the one guide rail thereby engage with positive locking connection in the positioning openings of the door body whilst the clip-like studs of the guide part connected to the other guide rail of the double-strand cable window lifter engage with play in the positioning openings of the door body which widen out at least in the X-direction so that an automatic tolerance compensation in the vehicle longitudinal direction or X-direction is guaranteed in conjunction with a slot opening in the fixing region of the guide rail which is wider than the part of the fixing means inserted through the slot opening.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To simplify the adjustment of the guide rail in the Y-direction of the vehicle after pre-assembly of the guide part on the door body, an angled edge zone of the fixing region of the guide rail has positive locking elements which can be brought into engagement with counter positive locking elements of a tool which can be inserted into a pot-shaped opening of the clip-like stud of the guide part associated with the relevant edge zone, this opening being open to the door body for guiding the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The adjustment of the guide rail relative to the door body of the vehicle door can thus be undertaken from outside of the door body whereby the pot-shaped opening in the one clip-like side profile of the guide part ensures a secure guide of the tool which is designed for example as a Torx screw driver. Since the opening provided in the door body aligns with the pot-shaped opening of the one clip-shaped side profile of the guide part which (opening) opens towards the door body, the number of apertures required in the vehicle door is also reduced. By turning the tool and connecting the positive locking elements in the angled edge zone of the fixing region of the guide rail with the counter positive locking elements of the tool an easy and secure adjustment of the guide rail is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition in the other clip-shaped side profile of the guide part there is a contact bearing bead which adjoins the outer edge of the angled edge zone of the fixing region of the guide rail whereby during adjustment of the guide rail in the Y-direction of the vehicle the fixing region of the guide rail is able to tilt about the contact bearing bead so that on the one hand a corresponding movement compensation of the guide rail is ensured and on the other hand the play between the positive locking elements on the angled edge zone of the fixing region of the guide rail and the counter positive locking elements of the tool is reduced. At the same time it is ensured that the rotational forces during actuation of the fixing means do not flow over the guide rails which unlike the prior art need not therefore be secured against rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A further advantageous development of the solution according to the invention is characterised by a detent catch connection which engages in a nominal position of the guide part relative to the fixing region of the guide rail so that the guide rail can be positioned in this nominal position without any other aids.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The detent connection consists of an opening provided in an angled edge zone of the fixing region of the guide rail and of a detent catch engaging in the opening and consisting in particular of a ball head which engages in the opening of the fixing region of the guide rail. This detent connection can according to a further feature be released and engaged again for the purposes of adjustment on the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The adjusting path through the slot opening in the fixing region of the guide rail as well as the detent opening for the nominal adjustment are defined on the guide rail and not on the guide part so that the guide part is not specific to the vehicle but can therefore be used for different vehicle models.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The fixing means preferably consists of the connection of a fixing screw with a fixing nut whereby the guide part holds the fixing screw or fixing nut secured both in the rotational direction and in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The hold of a part of the fixing means secured against loss in the guide part is thus guaranteed and a counter bearing when tightening the fixing means ensures the force locking connection between the fixing region of the guide rail and the door body of the vehicle door.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The connecting region between the fixing region <b>10</b> of a guide rail <b>1</b> and an outer surface area <b>20</b>, by way of example a door sill or door body, of a door body <b>2</b>, is shown in different views partly in section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> which each show additionally the alignment of the parts which are to be connected by means of a guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>producing the connection in relation to the axes of a vehicle of which the X-axis corresponds to the vehicle longitudinal direction, the Y-axis to the vehicle transverse direction and the Z-axis to the vehicle vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross-section through the connecting region with a door body <b>20</b> of a door body <b>2</b> designed as a door inside panel and on which the fixing region <b>10</b> of a guide rail <b>1</b> is fixed, but is connected to the door body <b>20</b> displaceable in the Y-direction. The positions A and B show the different end positions of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> which consists of a fixing angle connected to the guide rail or of an angled end of the guide rail <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The connection between the fixing region <b>10</b> and the door body <b>20</b> is by means of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>which is shown in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> and which is assembled from a base plate <b>4</b> which is arranged in the fitted state between the fixing region <b>10</b> and the door body <b>20</b>, and of a cover <b>5</b> which is connected to the base plate <b>4</b> and which bears with its inside face against the fixing region <b>10</b>. The cover <b>5</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>has a screw head socket <b>50</b> which holds the fixing screw head <b>63</b> secured against loss and rotation through positive locking engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>holds the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> between its base plate <b>4</b> and its cover <b>5</b> and is prefitted on the door body <b>20</b> through fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b>. After the automatic alignment of the guide rail or after the additional manual alignment of the guide rail <b>1</b> by means of an adjusting lever <b>17</b> which is angled away from the fixing region <b>10</b> and which projects through an opening in the door body <b>20</b> where it can then be operated from outside of the door body <b>2</b>, the final connection is made between the guide rail <b>1</b> and door body <b>2</b> through a fixing means <b>6</b> which is pushed through an oblong hole <b>18</b> in the fixing region <b>10</b>, a corresponding opening in the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and an opening in the door body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The fixing means <b>6</b> consists according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of a fixing screw <b>60</b> whose fixing screw head <b>63</b> is fixed secured against loss and rotation in the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and whose screw thread <b>64</b> is screwed to a fixing nut <b>61</b> which is fitted on from outside of the door body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>is exposed to slight surface area pressure since the contact pressure force produced through the fixing means <b>6</b> is transferred through the fixing screw head <b>63</b> to the metal fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b>, through the base plate <b>4</b> to the door body <b>20</b>. It is thereby possible to make the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>which is composed of the cover <b>5</b> and base plate <b>4</b> from plastics in a single moulding process. Alternatively the cover <b>5</b> can form a continuous surface area on which the fixing screw head <b>63</b> of the fixing means <b>6</b> rests so that the fixing means <b>6</b> is incorporated fully into the guide part <b>3</b>. In this embodiment is it advantageous if the contact area of the fixing screw head <b>63</b>, where necessary also the entire cover <b>5</b>, is provided with a glass fibre reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a longitudinal sectional view through the connecting region with a lower part of the guide rail <b>1</b> and its fixing region <b>10</b> connected to the door body <b>20</b> through the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and shows the connection of the base plate <b>4</b> to the cover <b>5</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>through a positive locking element <b>56</b> as well as a closing clip <b>55</b> which engages through an opening in the fixing region <b>10</b> and locks with the base plate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A detent element <b>51</b> which engages in a recess or opening <b>19</b> in the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> serves to pre-position the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>on the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b>. The guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>provides by means of the detent element <b>51</b> a standard position which serves for the pre-adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a plan view of the connecting region with the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b>, the cover <b>5</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>as well as the openings or slots <b>21</b> to <b>25</b> provided in the door body <b>20</b> and shows the adjustability of the guide rail <b>1</b> in the Y direction through the arrangement of an oblong hole <b>18</b> in the fixing region <b>10</b> as well as an opening <b>25</b> in the door body through which the adjusting lever <b>17</b> is pushed. The fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> which protrude from the outside of the base plate <b>4</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>are inserted into slots <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> in the door body <b>20</b> of which two slots, namely the slots <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are longer than the width of the associated fixing clips <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> so that an X-compensation is possible. On the other hand the fixing clips <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are inserted into slots <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> whose length corresponds to the width of the fixing clips <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> so that these fixing clips <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are fixed in the X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Transfer of torque to the guide rail <b>1</b> during tightening of the fixing means <b>6</b> is prevented through the fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> inserted in the slots <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> since the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pre-fixed on the door body <b>20</b> through the fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> and torque occurring when securing the fixing means <b>6</b> is diverted into the door body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The illustration of the fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> and slots <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is easy to understand since either slots <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> are provided adapted to the width of the fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> and thus enable no X-compensation or slots <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> are provided whose length is greater than the width of the associated fixing clips <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> so that X-compensation is possible. This means however that the insert part is suitable for the use of a guide rail in the region of the A-pillar and also a guide rail in the region of the B-pillar of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Through this type of connection of guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>with the outer surface area <b>20</b> of the door body <b>2</b> it is ensured that the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the case of a double-strand cable window lifter with two guide rails can be used both for fixing the guide rail associated with the A-pillar and for fixing the guide rail associated with the B-pillar. The orientation of the fixing clips enables an X-compensation in the case of the guide rail which is associated with the A-pillar in that the associated slots are wider than the fixing clips. On the other hand through a width of the slot which is adapted to the width of the fixing clips a securing of the guide part is effected which serves to fix the guide rail which is associated with the B-pillar.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The X-compensation of the guide rail associated with the A-pillar is very important for a parallel lowering of the window pane guided over the guide rails so that sluggish action in the window lifter system is avoided. This X-compensation is then possible if the window pane is also moved downwards without the fixing means already being tightened and thus the relevant guide rail fixed on the door body. Thus the guide rail can automatically be positioned in the X and Y directions prior to actuating the fixing element whereby the fixing clips ensure that when tightening the fixing means after the automatic pre-positioning of the guide rail no torque is exerted on the guide rail with the resulting twisting of the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A convex contact bearing face <b>52</b> provided on the cover <b>5</b> and illustrated by dotted lines adjoins one side edge of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail and by rotating the fixing region <b>10</b> around the Z axis enables automatic positioning of the fixing region <b>10</b> so that there is no twisting of the guide rail <b>1</b> during pre-fitting or tightening of the fixing means <b>6</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The base plate <b>4</b> and the cover <b>5</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>a </i>are connected together for swivel movement through a hinge designed as a film hinge <b>36</b>. The four fixing clips <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> are arranged in the corner regions of the base plate <b>4</b> and can be pushed through the slots <b>21</b> to <b>25</b> in the door body <b>20</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to adjoin with their contact bearing edges in the fitted state against the outside of the door body <b>20</b>. Furthermore the base plate <b>4</b> has a bore <b>40</b> through which the fixing means <b>6</b> are pushed. Further recesses in the form of oblong holes <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> serve to hold a closing clip <b>55</b> and a positive locking element <b>56</b> in the cover <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The cover <b>5</b> has the closing clip <b>55</b> and the positive locking element <b>56</b> which is designed as a web and which is mounted on a raised surface <b>54</b> whose height corresponds roughly to the thickness of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> arranged between the base plate <b>4</b> and cover <b>5</b>. Furthermore the cover <b>5</b> contains a profiled screw head socket <b>50</b> which is adapted to a hexagonal screw head. The screw head socket <b>50</b> supports the part of the fixing means <b>6</b> designed as a fixing screw <b>60</b> secured against loss in the prefitted state and ensures an anti-rotational lock when screwing on a part of the fixing means <b>6</b> designed as a fixing nut <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore a detent element <b>51</b> is provided which consists of a ball head and a spring tongue so that it can engage with positive locking action in the corresponding counter detent element in the form of a recess or bore of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A convex stop <b>52</b> of the cover <b>5</b> formed on the raised surface <b>54</b> adjoins a side edge of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> in the fitted state and enables a movement compensation of the fixing region <b>10</b> about the vehicle vertical axis (Z-axis) so that the guide rail <b>1</b> can automatically seek a suitable position without torque being exerted on same.</p>

Through the fixing means opening <b>26</b> of the door body <b>2</b> is pushed the fixing screw shaft <b>62</b> of a fixing screw <b>60</b> which is screwed with a fixing nut <b>61</b> which is held in the fixing means socket <b>33</b> secured in the rotational direction and in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The stud <b>32</b> has the pot shaped opening <b>35</b> which is open towards the door body <b>2</b> to receive the tool (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>) which engages by its toothed region into the undulating toothed region <b>15</b> of the angled edge zone <b>14</b> of the fixing region <b>10</b>. In the opposite angled edge zone <b>13</b> is provided the detent opening <b>16</b> to hold a detent catch <b>37</b> which is designed as part of a clip <b>34</b> and which on engagement in the detent opening <b>16</b> secures the nominal position of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>in relation to the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b>. The detent catch <b>37</b> is formed as a plastics head which in the nominal position of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>engages in the detent opening <b>16</b> in the angled edge zone <b>13</b> of the fixing region <b>10</b>. This detent connection can be released for adjusting the guide rail <b>1</b> in the Y-direction and can be engaged again for pre-fitting the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>secured against loss on the connecting region <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As can be seen from the perspective view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>transfer the screwing forces which arise when screwing on the fixing screw <b>60</b> and fixing nut <b>61</b> directly to the door body <b>2</b> so that the screwing forces are not guided through the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b> but are diverted directly into the vehicle door. The studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> thus serve to secure the guide rail <b>1</b> against rotation during their force locking connection with the door body <b>2</b> of the vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore the positioning openings <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> in the door body <b>2</b> in conjunction with the studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> serve to pre-position and pre-fix the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>on the door body <b>2</b> of the vehicle door.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show in a perspective view from different aspects the connecting device during the adjustment of the guide rail <b>1</b> in the Y-direction of the vehicle by means of a tool <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show the tool <b>8</b> pushed through the opening <b>22</b> in the door base of the door body <b>2</b> in the form of a Torx screw driver which is guided in the pot-shaped opening <b>35</b> provided in the stud <b>32</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>and which engages in the undulating toothed region <b>15</b> of the angled edge zone <b>14</b> of the fixing region <b>10</b>. By turning the tool <b>8</b> in one or other direction of rotation the fixing region <b>10</b> is guided through the slot opening <b>12</b> in one or other direction in the Y-direction of the vehicle and the guide rail <b>1</b> is thus aligned in relation to the door body <b>2</b>. After aligning the guide rail <b>1</b> the fixing means <b>6</b> is tightened and thus a force locking connection is produced between the bearing face <b>11</b> of the fixing region <b>10</b> and the door body <b>2</b>. The studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> which are inserted into the positioning openings <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> of the door body <b>2</b> thereby divert the screwing forces directly into the door body <b>2</b> so that no rotation of the fixing region <b>10</b> can be caused by the screwing forces through the guide part <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows in a perspective view from below the connection the holding of the tool <b>8</b> in the pot-shaped opening <b>35</b> of the stud <b>32</b> which like the opposite stud <b>31</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>engages round the angled edge zone <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the fixing region <b>10</b> of the guide rail <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When connecting the two guide rails of a double-strand cable window lifter the one guide rail as already described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref> is connected to the door body <b>2</b> whilst the other guide rail for automatic compensation in the direction of the vehicle longitudinal axis or X-direction is connected to a guide part which is prefitted on the fixing region of this guide rail and which engages in the moulded holes of the door body <b>2</b> which are formed as oblong holes in the X-direction so that the studs of the guide part can execute a movement compensation in the X-direction. In the same way the slot opening <b>12</b> in the fixing region of this guide rail is wider than the fixing screw shaft so that the fixing region can also execute a compensation movement in the X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">By inserting the guide parts which are prefitted on the fixing regions of the two guide rails into the moulded holes or moulded holes extended in the X-direction of the door body, the tolerances are automatically compensated in the X-direction whilst the fine adjustment in the Y-direction is carried out in the manner described above by means of a tool <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>can therefore be used both for a guide rail mounted on the A-pillar and also for a guide rail mounted on the B-pillar. The orientation of the clip-like studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b </i>enables an X-compensation with for example the guide rail associated with the A-pillar when the positioning openings <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> in the door body <b>2</b> in the X-direction are wider than the clip-shaped studs <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the guide part <b>3</b><i>b</i>. This X-compensation is very important and leads to an exact parallel alignment of the two guide rails of a double-strand cable window lifter so that sluggish action is prevented in any window lifter system. The X-compensation is then possible if the window pane is moved downwards without the fixing means on the guide rail associated with the A- pillar having produced a fixed connection between the fixing region of the guide rail and the door body of the vehicle door. The guide rail is thus automatically positioned in the X and Y directions of the vehicle.</p>
