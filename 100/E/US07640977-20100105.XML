<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present document is based on and claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/597,402, filed Nov. 29, 2005.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many types of wells, e.g. oil and gas wells, are completed in multiple stages. A lower stage of the completion is moved downhole on a running string and may comprise either a stand-alone screen or a screen with a gravel pack in the annulus between the screen and the open hole or casing. After the lower completion running string is retrieved, an upper stage of the completion is deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many applications, it is desirable to instrument the lower completion with electrical or optical sensors or to provide for transmission of fluids to devices in the lower completion. For example, a fiber optic cable can be placed in the annulus between the screen and the open or cased hole. To enable communication of signals between the sensor in the lower completion and the surface or seabed, a wet-mate connection is needed between the upper and lower completion equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical, electrical and fluid wet-mate connectors typically are designed as discrete stand-alone components. The stand-alone connectors are mated in a downhole environment that can be full of debris and contaminants. For instance, the mating can take place after an open hole gravel pack which creates a high probability for substantial amounts of debris and contaminants in the wellbore at the vicinity of the connectors during the mating sequence. Existing discrete optical, electrical and fluid wet-mate connectors have proven to be very susceptible to contamination by debris during the mating process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, the discrete nature of the connectors results in an unfavorable geometry that can be difficult to integrate into the completion equipment. The outer diameter of the completion equipment must fit within the inner casing diameter. A centralized, large diameter inner port also is needed to provide access for service equipment into the lower completion and to provide a large flow area for production or injection of fluids. The remaining annular space is not well suited to the typical circular cross section of discrete connectors. This limitation compromises the overall design of the completion equipment and also limits the total number of channels that can be accommodated within a given envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The geometry of the discrete connectors also increases the difficulty of adequate flushing and debris removal from within and around the connectors prior to and during the mating sequence. Attempts to protect the connectors from debris and/or to provide adequate flushing have lead to completion equipment designs that have great complexity with an undesirable number of failure modes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, the present invention provides a system and method for coupling control line connectors during engagement of multiple stage completions. A first completion stage has a communication line protected from debris and other contaminants. Similarly, a subsequent completion stage has a communication line protected from debris and other contaminants. Following deployment of the first completion stage to a downhole location, the subsequent completion stage is moved into engagement with the first completion stage. During the engagement process, the communication lines are coupled.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention relates to a system and methodology for connecting multiple stage completions in a wellbore environment. The system and methodology enable protection of communication line connectors during deployment and engagement of completion stages. The communication line connectors associated with each completion stage are enclosed for protection from debris and other contaminants that can occur during certain wellbore procedures, e.g. gravel packing procedures. Protecting the communication line connectors facilitates coupling of the connectors upon the engagement of the separate stages at a downhole location. Additionally, the design of the stages and communication line connectors provides a desirable geometry that does not interfere with or limit operation of the completion equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the system enables the deployment of a lower assembly in a wellbore and the subsequent engagement of an upper assembly and one or more control lines. In one embodiment, the system is capable of deploying and connecting a fixed fiber optic sensor network in a two-stage completion. In this embodiment, once the connection is established, a continuous optical path is established from a surface location to the bottom of an open hole formation and back to the surface location to complete an optical loop. The connection also may be established for other control lines, such as electrical control lines or fluid control lines in various combinations. The control line connections may be established, broken and reestablished repeatedly. This type of system may be used for land applications, offshore platform applications, or subsea deployments in a variety of environments and with a variety of downhole components. By way of example, the system may utilize fiber sensing systems and the deployment of fiber optic sensors in sand control components, perforating components, formation fracturing components, flow control components, or other components used in various well operations including well drilling operations, completion operations, maintenance operations, and/or production operations. The system also may be used to connect fiber-optic lines, electric lines and/or fluid communication lines below an electric submersible pump to control flow control valves or other devices while allowing the electric submersible pump to be removed from the wellbore and replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other embodiments, the system may comprise a well operations system for installation in a well in two or more stages. The well operations system may comprise a lower assembly, an upper assembly, and a connector for connecting a control line in the upper assembly to a corresponding control line in the lower assembly. This type of connection system and methodology can be used to connect a variety of downhole control lines, including communication lines, power lines, electrical lines, fiber optic lines, hydraulic conduits, fluid communication lines, and other control lines. Additionally, the upper and lower assemblies may comprise a variety of components and assemblies for multistage well operations, including completion assemblies, drilling assemblies, well testing assemblies, well intervention assemblies, production assemblies and other assemblies used in various well operations. The upper and lower assemblies also may comprise a variety of components depending on the application, including tubing, casing, liner hangers, formation isolation valves, safety valves, other well flow/control valves, perforating and other formation fracturing tools, well sealing elements, e.g. packers, polish bore receptacles, sand control components, e.g. sand screens and gravel packing tools, artificial lift mechanisms, e.g. electric submersible pumps or other pumps/gas lift valves and related accessories, drilling tools, bottom hole assemblies, diverter tools, running tools and other downhole components.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It also should be noted that within this description, the term &#x201c;lower&#x201d; also can refer to the first or lead equipment/assembly moved downhole. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;upper&#x201d; can refer to the second or later equipment/assembly moved downhole into engagement with the lower unit. In a horizontal wellbore, for example, the lower equipment/assembly is run downhole first prior to the upper equipment/assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of a wellbore <b>20</b> is illustrated between a wellbore wall <b>22</b> and a wellbore centerline <b>24</b>. A completion <b>26</b> is illustrated in cross-sectional profile as having a first or lower completion stage <b>28</b> and a second or upper completion stage <b>30</b>. The lower completion stage generally is the stage deployed first into either a vertical or deviated wellbore. Also, the lower completion stage <b>28</b> and the upper completion stage <b>30</b> may comprise a variety of completion types depending on the specific wellbore application for which the multiple stage completion is designed. For example, the lower stage completion may be designed with sand screens or screens with gravel pack components. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower completion stage <b>28</b> has been moved to a desired downhole location with a service tool or with other deployment or running equipment, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Once lower completion stage <b>28</b> is positioned in the wellbore and the deployment equipment is retrieved, the next completion stage <b>30</b> can be moved downhole toward engagement with the lower completion stage, as illustrated, to ultimately form a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lower completion stage <b>28</b> comprises a housing <b>32</b> that forms a receptacle <b>34</b> which is run into the wellbore and remains in the wellbore with lower completion stage <b>28</b> when the service tool is removed. Housing <b>32</b> comprises a lower body section <b>35</b> and a shroud <b>36</b>, e.g. a helical shroud or muleshoe, having an alignment slot <b>38</b> and a flush port <b>40</b>. Lower completion stage <b>28</b> also comprises a passageway <b>42</b> through housing <b>32</b> for routing of a communication line <b>44</b> to a communication line connector <b>46</b> integrated with the lower completion stage. Communication line <b>44</b> may comprise, for example, a fiber optic line, an electric line, an auxiliary conduit or control line for transmitting hydraulic or other fluids, or a tubing for receiving a fiber optic line. Correspondingly, communication line connector <b>46</b> may comprise a fiber optic connector, an electric line connector, a hydraulic connector, or a tubing connector through which a fiber optic line is deployed. By way of specific example, communication line connector <b>46</b> comprises a fiber optic ferrule receptacle; communication line <b>44</b> comprises an optical fiber disposed within a flexible protected tube; and passageway <b>42</b> comprises an optical fluid chamber. The optical fluid chamber can be compensated to equal or near hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore, or the chamber can be at atmospheric pressure or another pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this embodiment, the lower completion stage <b>28</b> further comprises a displaceable member <b>48</b> movably disposed along a surface of receptacle <b>34</b> to enclose communication line connector <b>46</b>. Enclosing communication line connector <b>46</b> protects the connector from wellbore debris and other contaminants prior to completing engagement of upper completion stage <b>30</b> with the lower completion stage. In the embodiment illustrated, displaceable member <b>48</b> is a sleeve, such as a spring loaded sleeve biased toward a position enclosing communication line connector <b>46</b>. Displaceable member, e.g. sleeve, <b>48</b> may be sealed to housing <b>32</b> via at least one lower seal <b>50</b> and at least one upper seal <b>52</b>. As illustrated, sleeve <b>48</b> also may comprise one or more debris exclusion slots <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The upper completion stage <b>30</b> comprises an upper completion housing <b>56</b> that forms a stinger <b>58</b> designed for insertion into and engagement with receptacle <b>34</b>. Housing <b>56</b> may comprise an inner tubing <b>60</b>, a surrounding upper body portion <b>62</b>, and an alignment key <b>64</b>. The inner tubing <b>60</b> has any interior <b>66</b> for conducting fluid flow and one or more radial flush ports <b>68</b> through which a flushing fluid can be conducted from interior <b>66</b> to the exterior of stinger <b>58</b>. The surrounding upper body portion <b>62</b> may comprise a passageway <b>70</b> for routing of a communication line <b>72</b> to a communication line connector <b>74</b> integrated with the upper completion stage. As with lower completion stage <b>28</b>, the communication line may comprise, for example, a fiber optic line, an electric line, an auxiliary conduit or control line for transmitting hydraulic or other fluids, or a tubing for receiving a fiber optic line. Correspondingly, communication line connector <b>74</b> may comprise a fiber optic connector, an electric line connector, a hydraulic connector, or a tubing connector through which a fiber optic line is deployed. By way of specific example, communication line connector <b>74</b> comprises a fiber optic ferrule plug or receptacle; communication line <b>72</b> comprises an optical fiber disposed within a flexible, protected tube that is extensible; and passageway <b>70</b> comprises an optical fluid chamber. The optical fluid chamber can be compensated to equal or near hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore, or the chamber can be at atmospheric pressure or another pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The upper completion stage <b>30</b> further comprises an upper completion displaceable member <b>76</b> movably disposed along an outer surface of housing <b>56</b> to enclose communication line connector <b>74</b>. Enclosing communication line connector <b>74</b> protects the connector from wellbore debris and other contaminants prior to completing engagement of upper completion stage <b>30</b> with the lower completion stage <b>28</b>. Similar to displaceable member <b>48</b>, upper completion displaceable member <b>76</b> may be formed as a movable sleeve, such as a spring loaded sleeve biased toward a position enclosing communication line connector <b>74</b>. Displaceable member, e.g. sleeve, <b>76</b> may be sealed to housing <b>56</b> via at least one lower seal <b>78</b> and at least one upper seal <b>80</b>. As illustrated, sleeve <b>76</b> also may comprise one or more debris exclusion slots <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As stinger <b>58</b> is moved into receptacle <b>34</b>, alignment key <b>64</b> engages alignment slot <b>38</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As the stinger continues to move into receptacle <b>34</b>, alignment key <b>64</b> and alignment slot <b>38</b> cooperate to orient the upper completion stage <b>30</b> with respect to the lower completion stage <b>28</b> such that the lower communication line connector <b>46</b> and upper communication line connector <b>74</b> are properly aligned when the upper and lower completion stages are fully landed, i.e. engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the upper completion stage <b>30</b> is lowered into the wellbore and into engagement with lower completion stage <b>28</b>, a flushing fluid is circulated continuously from the interior <b>66</b> of tubing <b>60</b> through a bottom opening <b>84</b> of tubing <b>60</b> and through radial flush ports <b>68</b>. From radial flush ports <b>68</b>, the fluid can circulate outwardly through flush ports <b>40</b> of lower completion stage <b>28</b> along a flushing flow path <b>86</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The fluid velocity and flushing effectiveness increases as the gap narrows between upper completion stage <b>30</b> and lower completion stage <b>28</b>. The completion may be designed such that seals on the upper completion stage <b>30</b> engage the lower completion stage <b>28</b> in a manner that blocks further flow through bottom opening <b>84</b>. This forces all of the flushing fluid flow through radial flush ports <b>68</b> and <b>40</b> to further increase the flushing effectiveness in the vicinity of communication line connectors <b>46</b> and <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the upper completion stage <b>30</b> is continually lowered, the upper sleeve <b>76</b> contacts the lower sleeve <b>48</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The contact between sleeve <b>76</b> and sleeve <b>48</b> blocks further flow of flushing fluid from port <b>68</b> to port <b>40</b>. The upper completion stage <b>30</b> is then allowed to move further into lower completion stage <b>28</b>. This movement causes the upper sleeve <b>76</b> to retract and seals <b>78</b> to engage and move along the lower sleeve <b>48</b> until the upper body portion <b>62</b> reaches a mechanical stop <b>88</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further movement of the upper completion stage <b>30</b> causes the lower sleeve <b>48</b> to retract, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It should be noted that in the embodiment illustrated, displaceable members <b>48</b> and <b>76</b> are being described as spring biased sleeves that are biased in a direction toward enclosing the communication line connector ends in a sealed environment. The retraction of lower sleeve <b>48</b> enables the upper sleeve <b>76</b> to continually move downward, creating a seal against lower body <b>35</b> in receptacle <b>34</b>, until a mechanical stop <b>90</b> is reached. At this point, the upper completion stage <b>30</b> has become sealingly engaged with the lower completion stage <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mechanical stops <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> determine the relative locations between upper body portion <b>62</b> and lower sleeve <b>48</b> and between upper sleeve <b>76</b> and lower body portion <b>35</b>. Those relative locations remain fixed throughout the remainder of the landing/engagement sequence. Relative spring rates on spring biased sleeves <b>48</b>, <b>76</b> can be used to control the opening sequence by determining which of the two sleeves retracts first.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the insertion of upper completion stage <b>30</b> into lower completion stage <b>28</b> continues, lower sleeve <b>48</b> and upper sleeve <b>76</b> continue to retract, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The continued retraction of the lower and upper sleeve creates a communication line connection chamber <b>92</b> that is sealed between upper body portion <b>62</b>, lower body portion <b>35</b>, upper sleeve <b>76</b> and lower sleeve <b>48</b>. Continued insertion of upper completion stage <b>30</b> into lower completion stage <b>28</b> expands the size of chamber <b>92</b> until communication line connectors <b>46</b> and <b>74</b> are exposed to communication line connector chamber <b>92</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">One or both of the communication line connectors can be moved into chamber <b>92</b> for coupling with the other connector. In the embodiment illustrated, however, communication line connector <b>74</b> is moved into and through chamber <b>92</b>. In this embodiment, upper body portion <b>62</b> is formed as a telescoping body having a first component <b>96</b> and a second component <b>98</b> that can be moved together to force communication line <b>72</b> through passageway <b>70</b> of first component <b>96</b>. The movement of communication line <b>72</b> pushes communication line connector <b>74</b> into chamber <b>92</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Ultimately, the telescoping movement of upper body portion <b>62</b> pushes connector <b>74</b> into full engagement with connector <b>46</b>, e.g. into full engagement of a ferrule plug with a ferrule receptacle. The coupling of connectors is accomplished without exposing either of the communication line connectors to detrimental debris or contaminants from the surrounding environment. Also, a telescoping spring (not shown) can be used to hold telescoping body <b>62</b> in an open position to ensure that sleeves <b>48</b> and <b>76</b> are retracted and chamber <b>92</b> is fully opened before the telescoping process begins. Relative spring rates between the telescoping spring and the spring biased sleeves can be used to control this mating sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Telescoping body <b>62</b> can be designed in a variety of configurations. For example, the telescoping body <b>62</b> can be attached to upper completion stage <b>30</b> such that allowing the upper completion stage to move further downhole automatically compresses a telescoping spring and cause movement of second component <b>98</b> toward first component <b>96</b>. In another configuration, a piston chamber can be ported to the interior of tubing <b>60</b> on one side and to annulus pressure on the other side. A piston within the piston chamber can be used to compress a telescoping spring by increasing tubing pressure above annulus pressure. In another configuration, the piston chamber can be ported to a control line extending to the surface instead of to the interior of tubing <b>60</b>. Pressure within the control line can be increased above annulus pressure to compress the telescoping spring. Alternatively, both sides of the piston chamber can be ported to control lines run to a surface location. Increasing control line pressure in one control line and taking returns with the other control line can be used to again compress the telescoping spring and move second component <b>98</b> toward first component <b>96</b>. These and other configurations can be used to move one or both of the control line connectors into and through chamber <b>92</b> in forming a control line coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The geometry of lower completion stage <b>28</b> and upper completion stage <b>30</b> enables efficient and thorough flushing and cleaning of the area around and between the communication line connection components prior to initiating the mating of the two completion stages. Additionally, the communication line connectors and communication lines are fully sealed from wellbore fluids during running of the lower completion stage and the upper completion stage in hole, during the mating sequence, and after the wet-mate connection has been established. The seals used, e.g. seals <b>52</b> and <b>78</b>, can be high-pressure seals that are durable in downhole applications. The sleeve members <b>48</b> and <b>76</b> and other members forming chamber <b>92</b> can be correspondingly sized to withstand high pressures, e.g. the maximum hydrostatic pressure plus injection pressure expected in the wellbore, while the sealed chamber remains at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an alternate embodiment of the connection assembly is illustrated. The cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is taken at to different levels to show a plurality of integrated lower stage communication lines <b>44</b>, e.g. control lines, coupled with a plurality of upper completion stage communication lines <b>72</b>, e.g. control lines. This approach accommodates multiple communication channels along the completion. In the embodiment illustrated, the plurality of communication channels formed by corresponding communication lines <b>44</b>, <b>72</b> are spaced circumferentially around completion <b>26</b>, although the communication channels can be located or spaced differently depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref>, additional alternate embodiments of the connection assembly are illustrated. In these embodiments, the communication line connectors also are integrated into the completion stages and thereby protected from debris and other contaminants to improve the connections formed. The connections may be formed by bringing the appropriate components, e.g. ferrules, contacts or ports, into alignment with each other axially and radially. The connection does not require lateral travel of the ferrules or other components. To form such a connection, each of the communication lines, e.g. hydraulic ports, is sealed individually and isolated from each other in addition to the circumferential sleeve seals used to isolate ports from the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, one alternate configuration is illustrated that is suitable for hydraulic connections but can also be used for optical or electrical connections. In this embodiment, a plurality of communication lines <b>44</b>, e.g. hydraulic ports, is provided and the ports are disposed sequentially in an axial direction along lower completion stage <b>28</b>. The communication lines <b>44</b> are integrated with the lower completion stage and are coupled with communication line connectors <b>46</b>. Similarly, a plurality of communication lines <b>72</b>, e.g. hydraulic ports, is provided and the ports are located sequentially in an axial direction along upper completion stage <b>30</b>. The communication lines <b>72</b> are integrated with the upper completion stage and comprise communication line connectors <b>74</b> that engage connectors <b>46</b>. The sequential ports are hydraulically isolated by circumferential sleeve seals <b>102</b>. Generally, the communication lines/ports are not located in the same axial plane but are spaced from each other. Once the connection is made and each set of integrated ports is aligned, optical fiber can be pumped through the connection system in applications utilizing optical fibers. Additionally, this embodiment as well as other illustrated embodiments can utilize a combination alignment system in which key <b>64</b> and alignment groove <b>38</b> provide for coarse alignment. However, a separate fine alignment key <b>104</b> and corresponding fine alignment slot <b>106</b> can be used to provide fine alignment of the lower and upper completion stages.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another alternate embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In this embodiment, the connection system has integrated control line connectors <b>46</b>/<b>74</b> that do not require rotational alignment. The communication line connections are accomplished by features that extend around the circumference of stinger <b>58</b> and receptacle <b>34</b>. For example, the communication lines <b>72</b> are coupled to circumferential features <b>108</b> that engage with corresponding circumferential features <b>110</b> coupled to communication lines <b>44</b>. Because the features are circumferential, the rotational position of the upper completion stage can vary relative to the lower completion stage. To form a hydraulic connection, for example, circumferential features <b>108</b> and corresponding circumferential features <b>110</b> may be formed as grooves on the outside of the stinger body and the inside of the receptacle body, respectively, to create flow paths for fluids. To form other types of connections, such as electrical connections, the circumferential features can comprise conductors or other suitable elements extending circumferentially to enable the communication of appropriate signals.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, the connection assembly comprises a compensation system <b>112</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Compensation system <b>112</b> can be used to prevent wellbore fluids from being transmitted to the internal components and connectors in the overall system while still allowing the internal components and connectors to be referenced to hydrostatic pressure. This approach reduces the pressure differential to which the seals are subjected without exposing the components and connectors to debris or other corrosive or harmful effects of the wellbore fluids. The compensation system comprises a compensator piston <b>114</b> that is sealed within and moves within a chamber <b>116</b>, e.g. a bore. On one side of compensator piston <b>114</b>, chamber <b>116</b> contains uncontaminated fluid <b>118</b> in fluid communication with, for example, fluid communication lines <b>72</b>. On the other side of piston <b>114</b>, chamber <b>116</b> is referenced to the surrounding wellbore by an external port <b>119</b> that extends either to the annulus or the tubing. Optionally, a spring <b>120</b> can be used on either side of compensator piston <b>114</b> to keep fluid <b>118</b> at a pressure significantly or slightly above or below the hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. The compensator piston <b>114</b> moves back and forth in chamber <b>116</b> to accommodate changes in wellbore pressure as well as the expansion and compression of internal fluids due to temperature changes. A relief valve <b>122</b> also can be utilized to limit the maximum pressure differential. In the embodiment illustrated, a single compensation system <b>112</b> is located in a running tool and connected to a plurality of hydraulic ports or passageways to equalize pressure acting on the communication lines in receptacle <b>34</b> and the lower completion assembly during installation. Alternatively, separate compensation systems <b>112</b> can be connected to individual communication line passageways. Additional flexibility can be added by providing single or multiple lines connected from the running tool to the surface to allow pressure inside the lines/passageways to be actively controlled either collectively or individually from a surface location during installation of receptacle <b>34</b>. The compensation system can be combined with the various connector assembly embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The various multiple stage connection assemblies described herein can be used with many types of completion systems depending on the specific wellbore application for which a given completion system is designed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, one example of a completion system <b>124</b> utilizing a multiple stage connection assembly <b>126</b> is illustrated. It should be noted that the multiple stage connection assembly <b>126</b> is representative of the several embodiments described above. Additionally, the completion system <b>124</b> is representative of a variety of completion systems, and the components and arrangement of components can vary substantially from one well application to another.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the embodiment illustrated, completion system <b>124</b> comprises a wellbore assembly <b>128</b> deployed in a wellbore <b>130</b> extending downwardly from a wellhead <b>132</b>. By way of example, wellbore assembly <b>128</b> may comprise an upper completion assembly or stage, e.g. stage <b>30</b>, having a ported production packer <b>133</b> and a contraction joint <b>132</b>. A communication line, e.g. communication line <b>72</b>, in the form of a cable, conduit or other suitable communication line extends downwardly to the multiple stage connection assembly. The wellbore assembly <b>128</b> also comprises a lower completion assembly or stage, e.g. stage <b>28</b>, having a variety of components. In one example, the lower completion assembly comprises a gravel pack packer <b>134</b>, a gravel pack circulation housing <b>136</b>, a formation isolation valve <b>138</b>, one or more gravel pack screens <b>140</b>, and a turnaround loop <b>142</b>. Additionally, a communication line, e.g. communication line <b>44</b>, may be in the form of a cable, conduit or other suitable communication line that extends below the multiple stage connection assembly <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted that multiple stage connection assembly <b>126</b> can be utilized in many other locations within completion system <b>124</b> and with other types of completion systems. For example, the multiple stage connection assembly can be placed above or below gravel pack packer <b>134</b>. Additionally, the multiple stage connection assembly <b>126</b> can be used for connecting many types of communication lines, including fluid lines, electrical lines, optical lines and other types of communication lines. Furthermore, the multiple stage connection assembly can be used to form communication line connections utilized in controlling the operation of flow control components incorporated into completion system <b>124</b> or located within wellbore <b>130</b> at locations separate from the completion system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In general, the multiple stage completions have been described in terms of connecting previously installed electric, fiber optic, fluid, or other communication lines. These communication lines or cables can be used for variety of purposes including communication of data. The lines themselves also can be used as sensors or for other purposes. The communication line connectors can be designed for connecting a blank control line in the lower completion stage with a blank control line in the upper completion stage. This control line can then be used to control valves or other devices located in the lower completion. It can also be used to transmit fluids for release into the lower completion in chemical injection or scale inhibitor applications. An optical fiber or other communication line can then be pumped through the coupled blank control line to form a continuous communication line through the multiple stage completion. In other applications, the mating sequence may be adjusted to form the communication line coupling prior to completing the landing of the upper completion stage in the lower completion stage. Other adjustments also can be made to the mating sequence depending on the specific well application. Furthermore, a variety of additional or alternate components can be incorporated into the lower completion stage and/or the upper completion stage to accommodate various well procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this invention. Accordingly, such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims.</p>
