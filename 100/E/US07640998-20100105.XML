<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An excavation apparatus having a mast, a sled slidably mounted thereon, a sled driving system for downcrowding and upcrowding the sled along the mast, and non-rotatable but extendable kelly sections that prevent slippage of the sled on the mast. An outer kelly section is attached to the sled, and an inner kelly section is extendable therefrom and retractable therein. A bushing maintains slidable alignment of the kelly sections on the mast. The inner kelly section is automatically powered into and out of the outer kelly section a distance proportional to the distance that the sled is downcrowded or upcrowded along the mast while preventing slippage. A rotary motor, attached to the sled, rotates a telescopic shaft housed within the kelly sections. A transmission secured to the lower end of the inner kelly section increases downhole torque. A boom connector downcrowds and upcrowds the mast for additional drilling depth capability.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Non-rotating kelly sections are shown in a drilling device in U.S. Pat. No. 1,971,922. The weight of the device, which does not have a power downcrowding mechanism, forces the auger into the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 3,426,857 shows a drilling device with a single kelly bar supported from the end of a boom of a track type vehicle. The single kelly bar slides through a housing of a rotatable guide which rotates the kelly bar. The rotatable guide is supported frame attached to the lower portion of the boom. No means of downcrowding is provided. Another rig with telescoping kelly sections is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,753,468. The outer kelly section slides axially within a guidance sleeve supported at its top end by the free end of the boom and at its bottom end by a hydraulic cylinder attached to the track type vehicle. Telescopic sections and control are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,969.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 4,137,974 shows telescoping kelly sections driven by a rotary table. The housing of the rotary table is mounted at the lower end of relatively tall derrick. The kelly sections when retracted are surrounded by the derrick structure. Downcrowding is achieved by a mechanism which includes a drum having two cables wound in opposite senses thereon. The drum is hydraulically driven. A pulley system is mounted on the top of the derrick and another pulley system is mounted on the top of the outer kelly section. The pulley systems and the derrick would make it difficult to interchange the kelly sections since free access to the top of the kelly sections is not possible in such a rig.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,499 shows a drilling device supported on the end of a boom of a track type vehicle. The drilling device is of the drill mast type with a single kelly bar which slides through a housing of a final drive unit. The axis of the mast and kelly bar appear to be the same. Because the mast is directly over the kelly bar a relatively high overhead or ceiling is required for drilling vertical holes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A more useful downcrowdable augering apparatus having kelly sections is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,091. The apparatus of U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,091 is very useful in sites having low overhead or ceiling. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,091 the kelly rotating means is bolted directly to the outer kelly section and as a consequence the outer kelly section is not permitted to slide through the kelly rotating means. Since the top of the kelly assembly is closed changing and/or replacing the kelly sections is more difficult than if the top of the outer kelly section were open.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another useful downcrowdable augering apparatus having kelly sections is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,277 which is concerned with making such apparatus and rigs readily adaptable to mounting on a wide variety of vehicles ranging from light truck beds a to large track type vehicles including caterpillar type machines. The invention facilitates maintenance and changing of kelly assemblies by its unobstructed access to the top of the kelly assembly. For example the top of the kelly assembly is free of rotary drive mechanisms and pulleys associated therewith. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,877,091 and 5,746,277 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,725,946 discloses an excavation apparatus which can be adapted to a variety of vehicles including smaller excavating machines such as backhoes and small trucks. The excavation apparatus can be quickly and easily connected and disconnected to vehicles by a one or two persons with a minimum of tools thereby allowing such vehicles to be converted as needed. For example, the smaller rear bucket on backhoes can quickly removed and the excavation apparatus installed in place of the rear bucket in about twenty minutes including the required hydraulic lines. The excavation apparatus of U.S. Pat. No. 6,725,946 does not require a winch for letting out and retracting the cable. Nor does it require a reel for storing the retracted cable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Application Pub. No. 2003/0051888 discloses a hydraulic drilling rig having a leader on a side that has means for downcrowding on a boom. The boom is telescopic but the leader is not. An auger motor, which is mounted on the opposite side of the leader from the boom, powers a drill string. The auger motor is fixed to the leader and does not move relative to the leader. The rig does not have telescopic shaft means but rather a drill string that can be lengthened by adding drill string sections. There is no lower bearing for the drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,105,684 for a roof bolter or roof bolt installation apparatus for use in mines discloses reelless extension apparatus that can also be used for drilling holes or coring purposes without installation of roof bolts. The invention supports a mine roof while holes are drilled in the roof and roof bolts are set. A drilling unit is slidably mounted on rods. The drilling unit includes a hydraulic motor that can be fitted to a drill rod, a roof bolt or a nut.</p>

The outer kelly section of the kelly section system is attached to a sled that is slidably attached to the mast. The outer kelly section is offset a small distance from the mast. In preferred embodiment, the axes of the outer and inner kelly section coincide and are parallel to the axis of the mast.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sled and extendable kelly section system are downcrowded relative to the mast by a sled driving means. The sled driving means comprises a hydraulically powered rotary motor, which is mounted at the top of the mast, that drives a flexible connection system attached to the sled.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A kelly extension system extends and retracts the inner kelly section relative to the outer kelly section such that the distance and direction that the inner kelly section moves relative to the outer kelly section is equal to and in the same direction that the sled moves relative to the mast. Thus, the movement of the inner kelly section is dictated by the movement of the sled.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The kelly extension system comprises sheaves rotatably mounted inside and near each end of the outer kelly section and upcrowd cables and downcrowd cables. One end of each upcrowd and downcrowd cable is anchored to the outside and near the upper end of the inner kelly section. The other end of each upcrowd cable is anchored to a lower end of the mast or an attachment thereto. The other end of each upcrowd cable is anchored to an upper end of the mast or an attachment thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another or second hydraulically powered rotary motor mounted on the sled drives a telescopic shaft means to which a rotary excavation tool is attached. The telescopic shaft means comprises an upper kelly bar shaft attached to the shaft of the second rotary motor, and a lower kelly bar shaft that is slidably connected to the upper kelly bar shaft. The lower kelly bar shaft is rotatably supported by a bushing attached to the lower end of the non-rotating inner kelly section.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the inner kelly section is non-rotating, other devices can be connected to the lower end of the telescopic shaft means and the rotary excavation tool then connected to such other device. An example of such other device is a torque converter unit or transmission for increasing the torque applied to the excavation tool. The torque converter unit if used would replace the lower bushing assembly between the inner kelly section and the telescopic shaft. The torque converter unit or transmission sacrifices RPM for an increase in torque. Therefore, on embodiment of this invention further comprises a means for increasing the torque attached to the lower end of the telescopic shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment the torque converter is a one speed transmission that can increase the torque applied to the output shaft of the transmission by up to about three times that of the torque applied to the input shaft of the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment the torque converter is a two speed transmission that when drilling or excavating can also increase the transmission output torque up to about three times that of the transmission input shaft torque. However, when the kelly sections are fully retracted the transmission is automatically shifted into direct drive thereby increasing the transmission output shaft speed or RPM so that it equals that of the transmission input shaft speed or RPM, and thereby decreasing the time required to discharge soil from the auger.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this invention slippage between the outer kelly section and the inner kelly section is prevented by the kelly section extension system of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this invention slippage of outer and inner kelly sections relative to the mast is also prevented by the kelly section extension system of this invention in combination with the sled driving means of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One improvement of the kelly section extension system of this invention is that it does not require a reel for the collection and storage of cable or chain to downcrowd or upcrowd the inner kelly section relative to the outer kelly section, or to downcrowd or upcrowd the sled and outer kelly section relative to the mast.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A rotary motor mounted on the sled, a telescopic shaft means connected to the rotary motor and inside the non-rotating kelly extension system for connecting to a rotary tool, wherein the rotary motor does not at any time go down the excavated hole.</p>

Inner kelly section <b>330</b> is axially centered in outer kelly section <b>270</b> the details of which will be disclosed later below.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0195">The kelly section extension system comprises upper sheaves <b>360</b> and <b>361</b> independently rotatably mounted inside outer kelly section <b>270</b> but on opposite walls thereof proximate an upper end <b>271</b> thereof. A small portion of each upper sheaves <b>360</b> and <b>361</b> protrudes through small openings <b>362</b> and <b>363</b>, respectively in the fore face <b>278</b> of outer kelly section <b>270</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0195" num="0202">As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the kelly section extension system forces the inner kelly section <b>330</b> to downcrowd two inches relative to mast <b>160</b> for every one inch that sled <b>180</b> is downcrowded relative to mast <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0203">Likewise, as can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the kelly section extension system forces the inner kelly section <b>330</b> to upcrowd two inches relative to mast <b>160</b> for every one inch that sled <b>180</b> is upcrowded relative to mast <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0204">It can also be appreciated that slippage between outer kelly section <b>270</b> and inner kelly section <b>330</b> is prevented by the kelly section extension system of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0205">It can further be appreciated that slippage of outer and inner kelly sections relative to mast <b>160</b> is prevented by the kelly section extension system of this invention in combination with the sled driving means of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0206">One improvement of the kelly section extension system of this invention is that it does not require a reel for the collection and storage of cable or chain to downcrowd or upcrowd the inner kelly section relative to the outer kelly section, or to downcrowd or upcrowd the sled and outer kelly section relative to the mast.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0207">Upper sheaves <b>360</b> and <b>361</b> are independently rotatably mounted between the inside of outer kelly section <b>270</b> and internal housing members <b>280</b> and <b>281</b>, respectively, as illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0202" num="0209">The lower end of inner kelly section <b>330</b>, when fully upcrowded relative to outer kelly section <b>270</b>, extends slightly below outer kelly section <b>270</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0210">In one embodiment of this invention tie-down block <b>366</b> also serves as tie-down block <b>376</b> for downcrowd cable <b>372</b>, and tie-down block <b>367</b> also serves as tie-down block <b>377</b> for downcrowd cable <b>373</b>.

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Telescopic Shaft Means</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 30</figref> also illustrate one embodiment of the telescopic shaft means <b>420</b> of this invention. In this embodiment rotary motor <b>390</b> has a shaft <b>391</b> that has a square cross section. The telescopic shaft means <b>420</b> comprises a shaft adapter <b>423</b> with a square cross section coupled to shaft <b>391</b> with a pin <b>424</b>. Shaft adapter <b>423</b>, which is relatively short compared to inner kelly section <b>330</b>, is coupled to a smaller inner and upper kelly bar shaft <b>425</b> having a square cross section with a pin <b>426</b>. Upper kelly bar shaft <b>425</b> has a lower end <b>427</b> that extends to nearly the lower end <b>279</b> of outer kelly section <b>270</b>. The coupled length of adapter <b>423</b> and upper shaft <b>425</b> is about the same length as inner kelly section <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0214">A larger outer and lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b> with a square cross section is slidably mounted over smaller kelly bar shaft <b>425</b>. An upper end <b>432</b> of lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b>, when sled <b>180</b> is fully upcrowded, is preferably a fraction of an inch below a lower end <b>429</b> of shaft adapter <b>423</b>. A lower end <b>430</b> of lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b> is welded to a tool receiver bar <b>431</b>. The end of tool receiver bar <b>431</b> is the lower end <b>422</b> of the telescopic shaft means <b>420</b> in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Lower Shaft Alignment Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0215">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, tool receiver <b>431</b> is rotatably mounted in and supported by a lower shaft alignment assembly <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0216">Lower shaft alignment assembly <b>440</b> comprises an inner kelly section foot plate <b>332</b> welded to the lower end of inner kelly section <b>330</b>, a plurality of radially extending gusset members <b>333</b> welded to kelly foot plate <b>332</b> and to the lower end of inner kelly section <b>330</b>, and a disk bearing <b>441</b> welded to tool receiver bar <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0217">Lower shaft alignment assembly <b>440</b> further comprises annular members <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> and <b>444</b> made of low friction materials, and a confinement member <b>445</b> all of which are in axial alignment with inner kelly section <b>330</b>, which is in axial alignment with shaft <b>391</b> of rotary motor <b>390</b>. A series of fasteners <b>446</b> compresses members <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b> and <b>445</b> together against kelly foot plate <b>332</b>. Thus, disk bearing <b>441</b> is constrained to axial rotation along the axis of inner kelly section <b>330</b> and shaft <b>391</b> at a fixed distance from kelly foot plate <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0218">Accordingly, as inner kelly section <b>330</b> is downcrowded and upcrowded a distance relative to outer kelly section <b>270</b>, lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b> and tool receiver bar <b>431</b> are also downcrowded and upcrowded the same distance relative to upper kelly bar <b>425</b> shaft while at the same time kelly bar shafts <b>425</b> and <b>428</b> may, or may not, be rotating. This is possible in this invention because outer kelly bar shaft <b>428</b> is not coupled to inner kelly bar shaft <b>425</b> but only slidable mounted thereto. In this invention since outer kelly section <b>270</b> and inner kelly section <b>330</b> are non-rotating, a large upper or lower bearing for outer kelly section <b>270</b> or inner kelly section <b>330</b> is not required thereby greatly simplifying the excavation apparatus and eliminating the servicing of such bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0219">A plurality of spaced apart holes <b>378</b> through the wall of the lower end of inner kelly section <b>330</b> permits any debris that may be present to be spun out of inner kelly section <b>330</b> during unloading of excavated material from auger.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0220">An annular member <b>447</b> for preventing debris from working into bushing assembly <b>440</b> is fitted to tool receiving bar <b>431</b> before installation of lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b> into upper kelly bar shaft <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0221">Preferably the members <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b> and <b>447</b> are made from high abrasion resistant and low friction plastics such as a fluoropolymer. The clearances between disk bearing <b>441</b> and low friction members <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> and <b>444</b> are preferably about 0.060 of an inch.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Alternative Telescopic Shaft Means Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0222">An alternative embodiment of the telescopic shaft means is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. In this embodiment rotary motor <b>390</b> has an output shaft <b>391</b> that is square shaped. Output shaft <b>391</b> drives outer and upper kelly bar shaft <b>460</b> which is prevented from separating from shaft <b>391</b> by pin <b>424</b>. Kelly bar shaft <b>460</b> is about the same length as inner kelly section <b>330</b> and has a lower end <b>461</b> that extends to about the lower end <b>279</b> of outer kelly section <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0223">A inner and lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> with a square cross section is slidably mounted into larger kelly bar <b>460</b>. An upper end <b>463</b> of lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b>, when the sled <b>180</b> is fully upcrowded relative to mast <b>160</b>, is preferably a fraction of an inch below a lower end <b>392</b> of shaft <b>391</b> of rotary motor <b>390</b>. A lower end <b>464</b> of lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> is welded to a tool receiver bar <b>465</b>. The end of tool receiver bar <b>465</b> is the lower end <b>422</b> of the telescopic shaft means <b>420</b> in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0224">This embodiment of the telescopic shaft means is preferred over the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 30</figref> because it does not require a shaft adapter such as adapter <b>423</b> and because lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> can be closer to shaft <b>391</b> of rotary motor <b>390</b> and therefore can be longer than lower kelly bar shaft <b>428</b>, thereby permitting greater overlap of the lower kelly bar with the upper kelly bar for all extensions.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Upper Shaft Alignment Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0225">In a further embodiment of this invention an upper shaft alignment assembly is provided if needed to prevent misalignment of the telescopic shaft means with rotary motor <b>390</b>.

<p id="p-0220" num="0227">Lower retainer ring <b>341</b> and bushing housing <b>343</b> are preferably welded to the inner kelly section.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0228">Gaskets <b>342</b> and <b>345</b> are made from a resilient material and have a square shaped central opening that fits snugly around upper kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> and a circular outside diameter that rotates freely within assembly <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0229">Upper retainer ring <b>346</b> attached to bushing housing with a plurality of small bolts <b>347</b>. Retainer rings <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> have a central circular opening that allows square shaped upper kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> to rotate freely therein.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0230">Bushing <b>344</b> has a square-shape central opening that fits around outer squared-shaped shaft <b>462</b> and a cylindrical outside diameter. Housing <b>343</b> has a cylindrical axial cavity that allows bushing <b>344</b> to rotate freely therein while maintaining shaft <b>462</b> in axial alignment with rotary motor <b>390</b>. A grease fitting <b>348</b> permits lubrication of the cylindrical surfaces between housing <b>343</b> and bushing <b>344</b> through an access port <b>284</b> in outer kelly section <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0231">Preferably bushing <b>344</b> is made from high abrasion resistant and low friction plastics such as a fluoropolymer. The clearance between bushing housing <b>343</b> and bushing <b>344</b> is preferably about 0.060 of an inch.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0232">Bushing assembly <b>340</b> can be attached to inner kelly section <b>330</b> at any point that permits assembly <b>340</b> to fit around outer kelly bar shaft <b>460</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0257" num="0264">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 32</figref>, in one embodiment of this invention a one speed transmission is attached to the inner kelly section foot plate <b>332</b> instead of the lower shaft alignment assembly <b>440</b>. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> bearing elements <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b> and <b>445</b> are not used and lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> is modified, in part by omitting the tool receiver bar <b>465</b> extension of shaft <b>462</b>, for connection to a one speed transmission <b>600</b> shown in schematic <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0265">Drive shaft coupler <b>622</b> is pinned to a modified lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b>. Then the one speed transmission <b>600</b> is bolted to inner kelly section foot plate <b>332</b> and transmission input shaft <b>624</b> is pinned to coupler <b>622</b>. Common axis <b>620</b> of transmission <b>600</b> is in alignment with the axis of shaft <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0266">One speed transmission <b>600</b> and most of its rotating components have a common axis <b>620</b>. An exception is the six axes of the planet gears <b>632</b>. The input shaft <b>624</b> has mounted thereon a sun gear <b>628</b> causing it to rotate at the RPM of input shaft <b>624</b>, i.e. at the input RPM to the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0267">Sun gear <b>628</b> engages the twelve planet gears <b>632</b>, which are arranged in two rows of six gears each, causing the planet gears to rotate about their six respective pins or spindles <b>636</b>.

<p id="p-0261" num="0268">The two rows of planet gears <b>32</b> engage two stationary ring gears <b>648</b>, respectively, that are fixed to transmission case <b>652</b> with plug welds <b>653</b>. The rotation of planet gears <b>632</b> causes their pins <b>636</b> to orbit about the common axis <b>620</b>, thereby causing housing <b>640</b> to rotate which then drives output shaft <b>644</b> at a RPM which is lower than the input RPM to shaft <b>624</b>. A preferred ratio of input RPM to output RPM is about 3/1. The output RPM depends on the ratio of the number of gear teeth on sun gear <b>628</b> and ring gears <b>648</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0268" num="0275">In another embodiment of this invention a two speed transmission is attached to the inner kelly section foot plate <b>332</b> instead of the lower shaft alignment assembly <b>440</b> seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 32</figref>. As in the case of the one speed transmission <b>600</b>, bearing elements <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b> and <b>445</b> are not used and lower kelly bar shaft <b>462</b> is modified, in part by omitting the tool receiver bar <b>465</b> extension of shaft <b>462</b>, for connection to a two speed transmission <b>700</b> shown in schematic <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0276"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref> illustrate a two speed transmission <b>700</b> with the transmission in low gear. When in low gear the two speed transmission <b>700</b> functions in a similar manner as one speed transmission <b>600</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0272" num="0279">Two speed transmission <b>700</b> and most of its rotating components have a common axis <b>720</b>. An exception is the six axes of the planet gears <b>732</b>. The input shaft <b>724</b> has mounted thereon a sun gear <b>728</b> causing it to rotate at the RPM of input shaft <b>724</b>, i.e. at the input RPM to the transmission. Sun gear <b>728</b> is inside of carrier housing <b>741</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> illustrates the internal configuration of the two speed transmission <b>700</b> when shifter rods <b>760</b> are fully extended thereby enabling the transmission to be in low gear and accordingly operable for delivering increased torque to the transmission output shaft <b>744</b>. As mentioned before, when in low gear two speed transmission <b>700</b> operates like one speed transmission <b>600</b> described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0281">Briefly, sun gear <b>728</b> engages the twelve planet gears <b>732</b>, which are arranged in two rows of six gears each, causing the planet gears to rotate about their six respective pins or spindles <b>736</b>. Pins <b>736</b>, which are spaced 60&#xb0; apart and are mounted in carrier housing <b>741</b>. Carrier housing <b>741</b> is mounted on and drives output shaft <b>744</b>.

<p id="p-0275" num="0282">As in the case of the one speed transmission of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, the two rows of planet gears <b>732</b> also engage two stationary ring gears <b>748</b> that are fixed to transmission case <b>752</b> with plug welds. The rotation of planet gears <b>732</b> causes their pins <b>736</b> to orbit about common axis <b>720</b>, thereby causing housing <b>741</b> to rotate which then drives output shaft <b>744</b> at a RPM which is lower than the input RPM of input shaft <b>724</b>. A preferred ratio of input RPM to output RPM is about 3/1. The output RPM depends on the ratio of the number of gear teeth on sun gear <b>728</b> and ring gears <b>748</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0277" num="0284">As in the case of one speed transmission <b>600</b>, two speed transmission <b>700</b> is self lubricating and requires no external hoses for pumping transmission fluid to and from the transmission. Oil pump driver gear <b>784</b>, which is driven by output shaft <b>744</b>, powers oil pump driven gear <b>786</b> and causes pump <b>787</b> to pump transmission fluid up through oil delivery tube <b>788</b> to the top innermost part of the transmission for lubricating all gears and bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0285">The amount of transmission fluid should be sufficient to lubricate the entire transmission. Thus transmission <b>700</b> is a sealed unit that requires no transmission fluid to be pumped externally into and out of the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0286">An upper bearing housing <b>791</b> is secured to an upper bearing plate <b>792</b> which is bolted to an upper plate housing <b>793</b> and an upper flange of transmission case <b>752</b>. An upper Timken&#xae; tapered roller bearing is provided in housing <b>791</b> for input shaft <b>724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0287">As in the case of one speed transmission <b>600</b>, two speed transmission <b>700</b> includes a Timken&#xae; taper roller bearing, a bearing housing, a seal, and a lower thrust flange for output shaft <b>744</b>, all of which are supported by and secured to a lower plate housing <b>795</b>, which is secured to transmission case <b>752</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0288">The transmission is automatically shifted into direct drive when inner kelly section <b>330</b> is fully retracted into the outer kelly section <b>270</b>. In such case-transmission shifter rods <b>760</b> will engage shifter rods abutments <b>295</b> that extend radially outwardly from outer kelly section <b>270</b> causing the shifter rods to be depressed downwardly into associated shifter rod guides <b>761</b> and causing the shifter rods to overpower drive plate standoff spring <b>764</b> and to engage associated shifter rollers <b>762</b>, which engage upper direct drive plate <b>768</b>. Direct drive plate <b>768</b> has upper engagement dogs <b>776</b> which are then forced downward and engage lower engagement dogs <b>780</b> which in turn causes carrier housing <b>741</b> to rotate at the same RPM as upper direct drive plate <b>768</b> thereby causing transmission output shaft <b>744</b> to rotate at the same RPM as the transmission input shaft <b>724</b>. In such configuration transmission <b>700</b> is in high gear or direct drive and the result produced would be the same as if the transmission were not present but in a configuration equivalent to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Thus the two speed transmission has the advantage of providing greater torque for drilling and greater output shaft RPM for spin-off or discharge of excavated soil with the added advantage that both speeds are automatically shifted and without having to pump transmission fluid into and out of the downhole transmission.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Other Features</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0289">The excavation apparatus preferably has a service winch system <b>480</b> comprising a hydraulic powered winch with reel <b>481</b>, a bridge <b>482</b> with sheaves <b>483</b> and <b>484</b> for deployment of a service cable <b>485</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.
