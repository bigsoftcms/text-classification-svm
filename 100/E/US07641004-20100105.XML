<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the general field of drilling, and is particularly concerned with a drill bit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the geological exploration, mining and construction industries, among others, drill bits are used to drill through rock, concrete and other materials. Typically, these bits include a crown made of a mixture of metal and diamonds. This crown is the portion of the bit that erodes the material through which a bore is drilled.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some bits include a central passageway through which water is injected. To let water and debris flow out of the drill's way, the crown typically includes a plurality of segments separated by openings.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The crown material used to manufacture the crowns of the bits is typically substantially harder than the material through which drilling is performed. However, this crown material is typically relatively brittle. Accordingly, the dimensions of the openings between the segments in the crown are limited by the brittleness of the material used to manufacture these crowns.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Indeed, if these openings extend too deep within the crown, there is a risk that a segment will be broken while drilling. In this case, there is a need to remove the bit from the drilling apparatus and to use a new bit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since these drill bits are relatively expensive, the size of the segments are typically limited in currently existing bits, as shallower openings between the segments render the latter typically less prone to being ruptured or otherwise damaged. This shallowness of openings is a desired characteristic as breaking a segment typically means that the whole bit must be discarded. In addition, the time required to remove the drill bit and to position the new bit inside the bore that was being bored is typically relatively long as the bit and drilling apparatus need to be removed entirely from this bore in order to replace the damaged bit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, bits including relatively shallow openings will be worn from drilling in a relatively short amount of time. Therefore, once more, there is a need to take time to remove the bit from the bore to drill at relatively short time intervals to replace the worn out drill bit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,416 issued on May 31, 1994 to Kim describes a drill bit that attempts to alleviate this disadvantage of previously known drill bits. In this patent, a drill bit including a tool body having an open upper end and an annular diamond blade portion is described. The diamond blade portion includes an upper circumferential edge and a lower circumferential edge, the diamond blade portion being attached at the lower circumferential edge to the open upper end of the tool body. A plurality of upper cuts each extends downwardly from the upper circumferential edge of the diamond blade portion. The upper cuts terminate at a depth of the diamond blade portion above the lower circumferential edge. A plurality of lower slots each extends upwardly from the lower circumferential edge of the diamond blade portion and terminate at a height below the upper circumferential edge. The lower slots are positioned under and between the upper cuts and extend higher than the bottom of the upper cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the configuration of this drill bit is not suitable for use in wet drilling wherein water is injected inside the drill bit during the drilling process. Indeed, the configuration of the cuts in this drill bit does not allow the water to flow radially outwardly towards the outside of the drill bit as no longitudinal passageways are present that would allow the water to move away from the crown of the drill bit after it exits the crown.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another problem that sometimes occurs in prior art drill bit is that the drilling process may produce a radially uneven abrasion of the crown. In cases wherein this phenomenon occurs, the efficiency of the drilling process is reduced relatively to cases wherein the crown is abraded substantially uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Against this background, there exists a need in the industry to provide an improved drill bit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved drill bit.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a broad aspect, the invention provides a bit for drilling a hole. The bit includes:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">a support member, the support member defining a support member proximal end and a substantially longitudinally opposed support member distal end, the support member having a passageway extending substantially longitudinally therethrough;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">a substantially annular crown defining a crown distal end and an opposed crown proximal end, a radially inwardly located crown inner surface and a radially outwardly located crown outer surface, a crown inner diameter and a crown outer diameter, the crown extending from the support member such that the crown proximal end is located substantially adjacent the support member distal end;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">a slot extending between the crown inner and outer surfaces from the crown distal end substantially longitudinally towards the crown proximal end, the slot defining a slot first side wall, a substantially circumferentially opposed slot second side wall and a slot proximal wall extending therebetween substantially opposed the crown distal end; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">a reinforcing member extending substantially circumferentially across the slot between the slot first and second side walls;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0019">wherein the slot includes a slot proximal segment extending between the reinforcing member and the slot proximal wall and a slot distal segment extending between the reinforcing member and the crown distal end.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">In a variant, the bit includes a plurality of slots each having a reinforcing member extending substantially circumferentially thereacross. The slots define a plurality of drilling segments, the reinforcing members interconnecting the segments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">Advantageously, the reinforcing members increase the robustness of the segments. Accordingly; such segments can extend longitudinally away from the support over a greater distance than in drill bits wherein reinforcing members are not provided. These segments are relatively less prone to failure than non-reinforced segments and allow for manufacturing drill bits having a relatively longer useful life because of the presence of the reinforcing members.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">In addition, in some embodiments of the invention, the reinforcing members allow for the correction of an uneven abrasion of the segments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">The bit is relatively easy to manufacture and is typically compatible with existing drilling equipments and methods. In some embodiments of the invention, the manufacturing method used to manufacture the crown causes deviations in the shape of the crown from a perfectly annular shape to be relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">In another broad aspect, the invention provides a bit for drilling a hole. The bit includes:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0025">a support member, the support member defining a support member proximal end and a substantially longitudinally opposed support member distal end, the support member having a passageway extending substantially longitudinally therethrough;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0026">a substantially annular crown defining a crown distal end and an opposed crown proximal end, a radially inwardly located crown inner surface and a radially outwardly located crown outer surface, a crown inner diameter and a crown outer diameter, the crown having a crown radial thickness equal to a difference between the crown outer and inner diameters, the crown extending from the support member such that the crown proximal end is located substantially adjacent the support member distal end;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0027">a slot extending between the crown inner and outer surfaces from the crown distal end substantially longitudinally towards the crown proximal end, the slot defining a slot first side wall, a substantially circumferentially opposed slot second side wall and a slot proximal wall extending therebetween substantially opposed the crown distal end; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0028">a reinforcing member extending substantially circumferentially across the slot between the slot first and second side walls, the reinforcing member extending substantially radially within the slot over a reinforcing member radial extension, the reinforcing member radial extension being substantially smaller than the crown radial thickness.</li>

<p id="p-0041" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a bit <b>10</b> for drilling a hole (not shown in the drawings). The bit <b>10</b> includes a support member <b>12</b> and a crown <b>14</b> extending from the support member <b>12</b>. A plurality of slots <b>16</b> is formed into the crown <b>14</b> and defines a plurality of drilling segments <b>18</b>. The bit <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of reinforcing members <b>20</b>, each reinforcing member <b>20</b> extending between adjacent segments <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">The reinforcing members <b>20</b> improve the structural integrity of the crown <b>14</b>. Therefore, the crown <b>14</b> may extend longitudinally from the support member <b>12</b> over a distance that is larger than distances that would be achievable using prior art crown configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">Although the crown <b>14</b> shown in the drawings includes 5 slots, it is within the scope of the invention to have crowns that include fewer or more slots. Furthermore, in some embodiments of the invention, only one slot is formed into a crown of a bit.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">The support member <b>12</b> defines a support member proximal end <b>22</b> and a substantially longitudinally opposed support member distal end <b>24</b>. The support member <b>12</b> has a passageway <b>26</b> extending substantially longitudinally therethrough. In some embodiments of the invention, the support member <b>12</b> is substantially tubular and cylindrical. In these embodiments, the support member <b>12</b> defines support member internal and external diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">The crown <b>14</b> is substantially annular and defines a crown distal end <b>28</b> and an opposed crown proximal end <b>30</b>, a crown distal surface <b>29</b> at the crown distal end <b>28</b>, a radially inwardly located crown inner surface <b>32</b> and a radially outwardly located crown outer surface <b>34</b>, a crown inner diameter and a crown outer diameter. The crown <b>14</b> has a crown radial thickness equal to a difference between the crown outer and inner diameters. The crown <b>14</b> extends from the support member <b>12</b> such that the crown proximal end <b>30</b> is located substantially adjacent the support member distal end <b>24</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0055">In some embodiments of the invention, the crown distal surface <b>29</b> is substantially perpendicular to the crown inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. Also, while not necessarily present in all embodiments of the invention, two substantially annular circumferential grooves <b>35</b> are formed into the crown distal surface <b>29</b>. The grooves <b>35</b> have a substantially V-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">In some embodiments of the invention, as better seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the crown outer diameter is substantially larger than the support member outer diameter and the crown inner diameter is substantially smaller than the support member inner diameter. In these embodiments, the slots <b>16</b> allow the passage of water from the passageway <b>26</b>, into the slots <b>16</b> and outside of the support member <b>12</b>. However, in other embodiments of the invention no water is used for drilling and the crown <b>14</b> may then have radial dimensions substantially similar to the radial dimensions of the support member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">The slots <b>16</b> extend between the crown inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> from the crown distal end <b>28</b> substantially longitudinally towards the crown proximal end <b>30</b>. As better seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the slots <b>16</b> each define a slot first side wall <b>36</b>, a substantially circumferentially opposed slot second side wall <b>38</b> and a slot proximal wall <b>40</b> extending therebetween substantially opposed the crown distal end <b>28</b>. The slot first and second side walls <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> extend substantially radially. In some embodiments of the invention, the slot proximal wall <b>40</b> is defined by the support member <b>12</b>. However, in other embodiments of the invention, the slot proximal wall <b>40</b> is formed by the crown <b>14</b> (this embodiment not being shown in the drawings)</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, the reinforcing members <b>20</b> extend substantially circumferentially across the slots <b>16</b> between the slot first and second side walls <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. One, two or more reinforcing members <b>20</b> extend across at least some of the slots <b>16</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of the invention wherein two reinforcing members <b>20</b> are substantially longitudinally spaced apart relative to each other within each slot <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> shows an embodiment of the invention wherein two reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>e </i>are substantially radially spaced apart relative to each other within each slot <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D</figref>, <b>5</b>F, <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>H show embodiments of the invention wherein only one reinforcing member <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>and <b>20</b><i>h </i>extends within each slot <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">The reinforcing members <b>20</b> are substantially cylindrical. However, as described in further details hereinbelow, the reinforcing members <b>20</b> may have other suitable shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">As seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, the reinforcing members <b>20</b> are spaced apart from the slot proximal wall <b>40</b> and from the crown distal end <b>28</b>. In these embodiments, the slots <b>16</b> each include a slot proximal segment <b>42</b> extending between the reinforcing member <b>20</b> and the slot proximal wall <b>40</b> and a slot distal segment <b>44</b> extending between the reinforcing member <b>20</b> and the crown distal end <b>28</b>. The reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the slot distal and proximal segments <b>44</b> and <b>42</b> have been defined with respect with one of the reinforcing members <b>20</b> extending across one of the slots <b>16</b>. However, slot segments may be defined relatively to other reinforcing member <b>20</b> extending across this slot <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">The reinforcing members <b>20</b> extend substantially radially within each slot <b>16</b> over a reinforcing member radial extension, the reinforcing member radial extension being substantially smaller than the crown radial thickness. Typically, the reinforcing member radial extension is from about 1 percent to about 90 percents of the crown radial thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">Indeed, if the reinforcing members <b>20</b> had a reinforcing member radial extension substantially equal to the crown radial thickness, there would be a moment during the wearing out of the crown <b>14</b> at which the whole circumference of the crown <b>14</b> would be in contact with the material through which a hole is drilled. Typically, this situation would result in relatively inefficient drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">In some embodiments of the invention, the reinforcing member radial extension is selected such that it is as small as possible while providing a suitable degree of reinforcement of the crown <b>14</b>. For example, and non-limitingly, it has been found that reinforcing member radial extensions of from about 20 percents to about 50 percents of the crown radial thickness produce good results. In terms of absolute dimensions, and non-limitingly, it has been found that reinforcing member radial extensions of from about 1.5 mm to about 5 mm produce good results.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">In some embodiments the reinforcing member longitudinal dimension must be sufficiently small to allow water and drilling debris to flow radially within the slots <b>16</b> at a sufficient rate. For example, and non-limitingly, it has been found that reinforcing members <b>20</b> extending substantially longitudinally within the slots <b>16</b> over a reinforcing member longitudinal dimension smaller than about 25 percent of a distance between the crown distal end <b>28</b> and the slot proximal wall <b>40</b> produce good results in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">Typically, the bit <b>10</b> is manufactured using graphite molds. For example, such a mold is substantially annular. Within the mold, inserts are provided at locations corresponding to the slots <b>16</b>. Then, a mixture of metal and diamonds in a powder form is inserted within the mold and pressure is applied onto the mixture to squeeze the particles forming the powder together.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">After the powder has been tightened, the segments are infiltrated with a compatible brazing alloy at a predetermined temperature. This infiltration process confers solidity to the crown <b>14</b>, as the brazing alloy acts as a binder for the metal and diamonds particles. In addition, the brazing alloy also reinforces a link between the crown <b>14</b> and the support member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">The reinforcing members <b>20</b> are formed by using inserts shaped substantially similarly to the slots <b>16</b>, each insert including one or more bores having a shape substantially similar to the shape of a reinforcing member <b>20</b>. Then, when pressure is applied onto the powder, the mixture of diamonds and metal flows into the bores and forms the reinforcing members <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the bores of the inserts are filled with the mixture that forms the reinforcing members <b>20</b>. Then, filling the sections of the molds corresponding to the segments <b>18</b> produces the crown <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">In yet another manner of manufacturing the bit <b>10</b>, the segments <b>18</b> are manufactured separately and simply positioned within a mold with inserts including the reinforcing members <b>20</b>. Subsequently, the powder is squeezed and brazing is performed as described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">In yet another manner of manufacturing the bit <b>10</b>, the segments <b>18</b> and the reinforcing members <b>20</b> are manufactured separately. The reinforcing members <b>20</b> are either manufactured using the same materials as those used in manufacturing the segments <b>18</b>, or they are simply manufactured using a metal. Thereafter, the reinforcing members <b>20</b> are brazed, welded, soldered or otherwise secured to the segments <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">Other steps performed in manufacturing the bit <b>10</b> are well known in the art and will therefore not be described in further details.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">In addition to diamonds dispersed in a metal matrix, the crown <b>14</b> may be manufactured using any other suitable abrasive dispersed in a suitable matrix. For example, so-called artificial diamonds might be used. Also, in some embodiments of the invention, the matrix includes a composite material, such as for example carbon fibers in a suitable resin.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">In use, the bit <b>10</b> is inserted at the end of a drilling apparatus and used to drill through rock, concrete or any other material. If required, water is forced through the passageway <b>26</b>. The water lubricates the contact between the bit <b>10</b> and the material being drilled and carries the debris produced by the drilling process away from the bit <b>10</b>. To that effect, the at least part of the debris and the water passes through the slots <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">The reinforcing members <b>20</b> improve the solidity of the drill bit <b>10</b>. when the bit <b>10</b> is used, the segments <b>18</b> are progressively worn. When the segments <b>18</b> are worn up to a point wherein the crown distal surface <b>29</b> reaches the reinforcing members <b>20</b>, the reinforcing members <b>20</b> are eroded along with the segments <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">After the reinforcing members <b>20</b> have been worn out, the segments <b>18</b> extend away from the support member <b>12</b> over a distance small enough that the risk of breaking the segments <b>18</b> by the drilling process is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">In a specific example of implementation, it was possible to manufacture bits similar to the bit <b>10</b> with slots <b>16</b> that were 16 mm deep. These bit were at least as strong and at least as resistant to accidental damage to the segments <b>18</b> as a bit that did not include reinforcing members <b>20</b> but that had slots of a depth of only 12 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref> illustrate an example of wearing out of the bit <b>10</b> wherein uneven wear is produces. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the bit <b>10</b> has not been used. After some use, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the bit <b>10</b> is worn out so that a crown distal surface <b>29</b><i>b </i>is convex between the crown inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. This convex shape is undesirable as it affects the drilling performance of the bit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0078">It has been observed that when the crown distal surface <b>29</b><i>b </i>reaches the reinforcing member <b>20</b>, further use of the drill accelerates the wear of the portion of the crown <b>14</b> located at the radial location of the reinforcing member <b>20</b>. After the reinforcing member has been abraded, a crown distal surface <b>29</b><i>c </i>is convex between the crown inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Further use of the bit <b>10</b> results in an increase in wear adjacent the crown inner and outer surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, which produces a substantially flat crown distal surface <b>29</b><i>d</i>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079">It is hypothesized that this evening out of the wear of the crown in a radial direction is produced by an increase in the heat produced in the crown by the reinforcing member <b>20</b>. However, other mechanisms may be involved in the production of this result.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C through 5H</figref> illustrate the cross-section of alternative reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>20</b><i>h</i>. The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>20</b><i>h </i>are all substantially elongated and of substantially uniform cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0081">The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>c </i>are of a substantially rectangular cross-section. The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>f </i>are of a substantially square cross-section. The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>d </i>are substantially plate-shaped and extend at an angle relatively to a longitudinal axis of the bit <b>10</b>. The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>e </i>are substantially plate-shaped and extend substantially longitudinally. The reinforcing members <b>20</b><i>h </i>are of a substantially star-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0082">The reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the examples of reinforcing members <b>20</b> and <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>20</b><i>h </i>are only examples and that many other suitable reinforcing members are within the scope of the invention. For example, reinforcing members having alternative uniform cross-sections and reinforcing members having non-uniform cross-sections are also within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C illustrate alternative slots <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>and alternative segments <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>of alternative bits <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>c</i>. The slots <b>16</b><i>a </i>do not extend perfectly radially. Instead, the slots <b>16</b><i>a </i>are angled relatively to radiuses of the bit <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The slots <b>16</b><i>b </i>are similar to the slots <b>16</b>. The slots <b>16</b><i>c </i>are tapered in a radially outwardly directed orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0084">The segments <b>18</b><i>a </i>have a shape different than the segments <b>18</b> because of difference in shape between the slots <b>16</b> and <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The segments <b>18</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>each have a radially outwardly located outer groove <b>19</b> and <b>19</b>&#x2032; formed longitudinally thereinto.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0085">The illustrated slot and segments shapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C are well-known in the art and will therefore not be described in further details. Also, the segments and slots may take any other alternative shapes in alternative embodiments of the invention.</p>
