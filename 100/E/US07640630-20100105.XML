<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2007-51567, filed on May 28, 2007, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly to an assembling structure between a door which opens and closes a storage compartment of a refrigerator and a handle extended in shaft form in a length direction of the door and mounted on a front of the door, where the assembling structure provides simple and convenient attachment of the handle to the door.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, refrigerators are used to preserve contents stored in a storage compartment in a cold or frozen state, by refrigerating the storage compartment formed inside a main body thereof using cool air generated by an evaporator of a refrigeration cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The storage compartment is provided in the main body, as opened toward the front, and the main body has a door at the front thereof to open and close the storage compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The door is hinged upon the main body and opens and closes the storage compartment by pivoting. A handle is formed on the front of the door for a user to conveniently open and close the door.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, the storage compartment is partitioned into a refrigerating compartment and a freezing compartment. Accordingly, a door for the refrigerating compartment and a door for the freezing compartment are separately provided for independent opening and closing between the compartments. Recently, the trend is toward a side-by-side refrigerator in which the refrigerating compartment and the freezing compartment are divided left and right, and the refrigerating compartment door and the freezing compartment door are mounted to the both front sides of the main body in a length direction of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some of the above-type refrigerators, the handle for opening and closing the door has a long shaft form extended lengthwise in a vertical direction of the door such that even a child of small stature or a person who is sitting is able to easily hold and operate the door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">More specifically, since the handle is extended lengthwise in a vertical direction corresponding to the length of the door, the handle is mounted by at least two fastening units for a stable connection, keeping a predetermined distance from the door along the length direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In general, the fastening units each comprise a first fastening member fixed to the door, a second fastening member fixed to the handle, and a third fastening member fixing the first and second fastening members to each other. The first and second fastening members may be fixed directly to the door and the handle, or through a dedicated screw. The third fastening member usually has the screw form.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the conventional mounting structure for the refrigerator handle, however, the first and second fastening members are fixed to each other by the third fastening member after being respectively fixed to the door and the handle. Therefore, processes for fastening the third fastening unit are increased according to the number of the fastening units. Furthermore, some operators have to hold the handle and the door while the others are fastening the third fastening member until the plurality of fastening units are all fastened. That is, several operators are required to fasten the handle to the door by the conventional fastening process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure has been made in order to solve the above problems. It is an aspect of the disclosure to provide a refrigerator capable of saving time and human labor in connecting a handle to a door thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional aspects and/or advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.</p>

Here, by rotating the first fastening member <b>60</b>, the connection part <b>61</b> having the screw thread thereon is screw-connected with screw holes <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> respectively formed on the fronts of the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the state where the first fastening member <b>60</b> of each fastening unit <b>50</b> is fixed to the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, the receiving member <b>80</b> mounted with the second fastening member <b>90</b> is inserted in the cap member <b>70</b> of the fastening unit <b>50</b>. The second fastening member <b>90</b> is fixedly mounted to the outer circumference of the receiving member <b>80</b> such that the supporting part <b>93</b> is received in the recess <b>83</b> and the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> and the bending parts <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> can enter the receiving member <b>80</b> through the cut part <b>82</b>. In this state, the cap member <b>70</b> along with the receiving member <b>80</b> received therein is fixed to the handle <b>40</b> by the screw <b>100</b> engaged with the first and second fastening holes <b>71</b> and <b>81</b> within the receiving member <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in each fastening unit <b>50</b>, the first fastening member <b>60</b> of the fastening unit <b>50</b> is fixed to the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, and the cap member <b>70</b> including the second fastening member <b>90</b> and the receiving member <b>80</b> therein are fixed to the handle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an operator fits the first fastening member <b>60</b> of the fastening unit <b>50</b> corresponding to the receiving member <b>80</b> received in the cap member <b>70</b> in a horizontal direction, and then pushes a handle <b>40</b> toward each of the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the refrigerator according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, as described above, the first fastening member <b>60</b> and the second fastening member <b>70</b> of the respective four fastening units <b>50</b> can be engaged with each other simply by pushing handle <b>40</b> toward each of the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, thereby mounting handle <b>40</b> to each of the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To be more specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, by pushing handle <b>40</b>, the front end part <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the insertion part <b>62</b> of the first fastening member <b>60</b> is brought into contact with the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> of the second fastening member <b>90</b> which is inserted in the receiving member <b>80</b> through the cut part <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During this, the front end part <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the tapered insertion part <b>62</b> widens the gap between the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>, thereby gradually entering the receiving member <b>80</b>. After the front end part <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the insertion part <b>62</b> penetrates the second fastening member <b>90</b>, the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> are restored to the initial position. Accordingly, the second fastening member <b>90</b> within the cut part <b>82</b> is locked and supported by the locking groove <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the insertion part <b>62</b>. As a result, the first fastening member <b>60</b> and the second fastening member <b>90</b> are engaged with each other and by this, the handle <b>40</b> fixed with the second fastening member <b>90</b> is connected to the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> fixed with the first fastening member <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since such connection between the first and second fastening members <b>60</b> and <b>90</b> can be simultaneously performed at the respective four fastening units <b>50</b> by the simple operation of pushing the handle <b>40</b> toward the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, there is no need to fasten the plurality of fastening units <b>50</b> individually when mounting the handle <b>40</b> to the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the handle <b>40</b> can be mounted with less time. Furthermore, the mounting of the handle <b>40</b> requires just one operator for pushing the handle <b>40</b> toward the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, thereby greatly saving the human labor involved in mounting the handle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In each fastening unit <b>50</b>, additionally, the cap member <b>70</b> includes a tool insertion hole <b>72</b> at a position corresponding to the gap between the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> of the second fastening member <b>90</b> in order to permit inserting a tool <b>200</b>, such as a screwdriver, into the cap member <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a tool insertion hole <b>72</b> is provided to insert the tool <b>200</b>, such as a screwdriver, in the gap between the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> of the second fastening member <b>90</b> within the cap member <b>70</b>. In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the operator rotates the tool <b>200</b>, the gap between the first and second ends <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> is widened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, thereby releasing the first fastening member <b>60</b> from the second fastening member <b>90</b>. Then, by being pulled forward from the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, the handle <b>40</b> can be separated from the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> with ease. That is, in the refrigerator according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, separation of the handle <b>40</b> from the doors <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> is also convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, in the refrigerator according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, both the cap member <b>70</b> and the receiving member <b>80</b> of the fastening unit <b>50</b> are formed by injection molding. Therefore, although a leakage current may occur at the main body <b>10</b> and flow to the doors <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> and the first fastening member <b>60</b>, the injection-molded receiving member <b>80</b> and cap member <b>70</b> are able to stop the leakage current from flowing to the handle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As can be appreciated from the above description, owing to the plurality of fastening units provided to the refrigerator according to the present disclosure, mounting of a handle to a door can be performed simply by pushing the handle toward the door. Therefore, the present disclosure provides for a saving in human labor as well as time for mounting the handle.</p>
