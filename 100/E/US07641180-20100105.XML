<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to handrails or top rails, balustrades, balcony barrier assemblies and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Barrier assemblies are provided for balconies, stairways, pathing, plazas, pool surrounds and many domestic, commercial and industrial applications. Many barrier constructions include a top rail, and if at an appropriate height, the rail is in the form of a handrail. A wide variety of post and rail designs, with and without infill panels are known. Existing designs suffer from a range of problems. For instance, with commonly used welded stainless steel handrails, the butt welds between lengths of stainless steel handrail require considerable on site work in order to provide an aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound continuous handrail. Some designs use unsightly bolts or other fixings. Other problems with existing designs include complexity of on site assembly, finger entrapment cavities and sharp edges. Where top rails, including handrails, are required to deviate from simple straight and right angle bend layouts, there is often a need for prefabrication to occur off site.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to provide an assembly that overcomes at least some of the above-identified problems.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0025" num="0039">Referring to the drawings, in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a handrail and supported panel assembly <b>10</b> according to the invention is shown. The handrail and supported panel assembly <b>10</b> comprises first and second handrail portions <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, a panel <b>25</b> supported at a top of the edge thereof, a post <b>40</b>, and a handrail-to-post connection assembly <b>50</b> located between the post <b>40</b> and the first and second handrails <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. The handrail portions <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> each have a constant cross-section, the constant cross-section defining an elongate recessed channel <b>22</b> on the underside. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show how the assembly can extend to any length and can be used for barriers having complex shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the handrail-to-post connection assembly <b>50</b> has a pair of partially overlapping arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b>. Each arm fits within respective recess channels <b>22</b> and <b>32</b> as is most clearly illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A primary fastener in the form of a hex-headed bolt having a shaft <b>62</b> passes through holes <b>53</b> and <b>58</b> within an overlapping portion of each of the arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> thereby providing a pivot about which the arms can be adjusted. The shaft <b>62</b> extends into an insert <b>70</b> within the post <b>40</b> to provide a pivot about which the arms can be adjusted. A spacer is provided between arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> and the insert <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0041">A feature of the handrail-to-post connection assembly is that the two arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> are identical. This simplifies construction and manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0042">Secondary fasteners in the form of rivets <b>24</b> and <b>34</b> are provided to secure the arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> within respective channels <b>22</b> and <b>32</b> as is clearly shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>. In some applications, it may be appropriate to use fasteners other than rivets. For instance, screws may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0043">The insert <b>70</b> comprises a shaped washer <b>73</b>, an upper portion <b>71</b> and a lower portion <b>76</b>. The insert <b>70</b> is arranged to grip the internal walls <b>44</b> of the post <b>40</b>. More specifically, upper portion <b>71</b> defines a through hole <b>74</b> and lower portion <b>76</b> defines a threaded hole <b>79</b> (this may be a blind hole or a through hole). The upper and lower portions <b>71</b> and <b>76</b> join at inclined engaging faces that slide relative to each other when forced together by tightening of the hex-headed bolt <b>60</b>. This sliding movement causes the insert <b>70</b> to grip the internal walls <b>44</b> of the post. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where the lower portion <b>76</b> has moved laterally to the right relative to the upper portion <b>71</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, the upper portion <b>71</b> and washer <b>73</b> may be combined into a single component.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an underside perspective view of the assembly <b>10</b>, it can be seen that the elongate recessed channel <b>22</b> has two important functions. Firstly it securely holds the upper edge of the panels in position and secondly it retains and recesses the arms of the handrail-to-post connection assembly. It can also be seen that, even from the underside, there are no finger entrapment points or untidy surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0045">Referring to the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that any desired handrail joining angle can be achieved above each post. Where architectural requirements dictate a pair of spaced apart posts adjacent a corner as illustrated at <b>200</b>, this can readily be achieved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a detailed plan view of the corner <b>200</b>. The handrail portions are held together and correctly aligned by a pair of arms <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>. These arms are the same arms as arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fastener <b>113</b> differs from the fastener <b>60</b> in that it comprises a short male portion that screws into a compact female portion thereby ensuring that there is little or no projection below the underside of the handrail portions (shown in dotted out-line). The handrail-to-post connection assembly between the posts adjacent the corner and the handrail portions are similar to the assembly <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except that only one arm <b>51</b> is used. With the corner detail assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the distance between posts <b>340</b> and <b>440</b> can be kept well below 100 millmetres in line with safety requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0046">Construction of a handrail and supported panel assembly <b>10</b> will now be described. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, posts <b>140</b>,<b>40</b>,<b>240</b>,<b>340</b> and <b>440</b> are fixed to the ground <b>5</b>. Fixing may be by way of a spigot or any other convenient attachment means. Once the posts are in place, handrail portions can be cut to length for assembly. For instance, handrail portion <b>20</b> spanning from the wall <b>7</b> over post <b>140</b> to post <b>40</b> can be cut to length. Once a special bracket such as the bracket shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has been attached to the wall <b>7</b>, the handrail portion <b>20</b> can be installed into position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Arm <b>51</b> is aligned to fit within the channel <b>22</b> of the handrail <b>20</b>. The next portion of handrail <b>30</b> can now be cut allowing for the correct abutment angle to the next piece <b>130</b>. Subsequent handrail portions <b>130</b>, and <b>140</b> etc can then be cut and fitted loosely over respective posts. Once the handrail portions have been cut to length and the correct alignment angles for each of the arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) have been determined, the arms <b>51</b> and <b>56</b> can be locked in position by tightening of the hex-headed fastener <b>60</b>. Tightening of the fastener <b>60</b> also firmly locks the handrail-to-post connection assembly <b>50</b> to the post <b>40</b>. Once all of the handrail-to-post connection assemblies have been set in this way, the panels <b>125</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>135</b> and <b>140</b> can progressively be installed as corresponding handrail portions <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are lowered onto their support posts. Finally, rivets such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as <b>22</b> and <b>32</b> can be installed to secure the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">With the assembly as so far described, the top edges of the panels are securely held in place within the channels that form part of the underside of the handrail portions. The lower edges of the panels must also be secured. This can be achieved in a number of ways. For instance, prior to assembly, U-shape channels may be fixed to the ground <b>5</b> in positions ready to receive the panel edges.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048">The preferred material for the assembly <b>10</b> is anodized aluminium. This material has excellent erosion resistance and appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0049">While the embodiment of the invention described above includes a handrail, other top rails that are not shaped as hand rails may be used, for instance, where the height of the top rail is not generally at a typical handrail height.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0050">While the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment in order to facilitate better understanding of the invention, it should be appreciated that various modifications can be made without departing from the principles of the invention. Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all such modifications within the scope.</p>
