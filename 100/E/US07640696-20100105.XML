<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a product server for holding and displaying products, and more particularly to a product server having a moveable panel for controlling access to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One such application for this invention is the storage and display of hot and cold food products. However, it is contemplated that other types of products may be stored and displayed in the product server. Existing product servers are common in restaurants where sandwiches or other food items are prepared by food service employees in the presence of a customer. Existing product servers are arranged to store hot and cold food products in pans on one side of the server that is readily accessible by the food server employees. These product servers allow employees to prepare a finished product (e.g., sandwich) on a counter of the server by using the different ingredients stored in the product server. Frequently, the sandwich or other food item will be made at the direction of the customer while the customer observes the food preparation process. It is important to the quality of the finished product that the ingredients held and displayed in the server remain fresh.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During extended periods of non-use, the food pans holding the different ingredients (e.g., meats, cheeses, vegetables or other condiments) must be individually covered so that the ingredients remain fresh. Some existing food server designs have a stainless steel cover that may be moved to cover the food pans. Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,168,719 and 5,182,924, incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, for additional background information on food servers having such a cover. Other existing food servers have a fixed hood that restricts access to the food pans from the back of the server and acts as a breath guard that protects items in the food pan from contamination. Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,340, incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, for additional background information on food servers of this type. A need exists for a product server that allows visual inspection of the products held in the server from the customer side and is easily closeable to protect the products from contamination.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the several objects of this invention may be noted the provision of a product server which displays products held in the server in a way which is pleasing to customers; the provision of such a server which allows access from the employee side of the server; the provision of such a server which protects products in the server from contamination from customers; the provision of such a server which allows viewing of products within the server; the provision of such as server which preserves products held within the server; and the provision of such a server which is attractive in appearance and which is easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a product server of the present invention holds and displays products. The product server has a front customer side, a rear employee side and a breath guard. The breath guard comprises a panel attached to the product server and moveable between a lowered position preventing access to products held by the product server and a raised position allowing access to the products. The panel is sufficiently transparent to allow viewing of the products held in the product server.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect of the invention, the product server has a breath guard comprising a panel attached to the product server for pivotal movement between a lowered position preventing access to products held by the product server and a raised position allowing access to products. At least one power assist device is connected to the product server and the panel for assisting the pivotal movement of the panel between its lowered position and its raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another aspect of the invention, the product server comprises a front customer side, a rear employee side, and a breath guard attached to the product server generally near the front customer side of the product server for pivotal movement between a lowered substantially horizontal position for covering food products held by the product server and a raised position in which the breath guard is configured to provide a barrier to contamination of the food products by customers on the customer side of the server while allowing access to the food products from the employee side of the breath guard. The breath guard is sufficiently transparent to allow viewing of the food products held in the food product server. The product server includes a first extensible and retractable power assist device biased toward a position for applying a lifting force to the breath guard to assist in moving it toward its raised position, and a second extensible and retractable power assist device not biased toward a position but operable to resist movement of the breath guard from its raised position to its lowered position thereby providing controlled downward movement of the breath guard.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a product server of the present invention is designated in its entirety by the reference numeral <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the product server <b>1</b> has a lower cabinet, generally designated <b>5</b>, and an upper frame, generally designated <b>9</b>, mounted on the cabinet. The server <b>1</b> has a front customer side <b>13</b>, a rear employee side <b>17</b> and a breath guard, generally designated <b>21</b>, that is moveably mounted on the server. The cabinet <b>5</b> has a recess <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) toward the front <b>13</b> of the cabinet that, in one embodiment, is adapted to support a plurality of food serving pans <b>27</b> within the cabinet. The breath guard <b>21</b> is generally moveable between a lowered position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in which the recess <b>23</b> is covered and a raised position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) allowing access to the food pans <b>27</b> held in the recess of the cabinet <b>5</b>. The cabinet has a counter top surface <b>31</b> toward the rear <b>17</b> of the server <b>1</b> that can be used to prepare a finished food product (e.g., sandwich) using the ingredients stored in the food pans <b>27</b>. It will be understood that the server <b>1</b> may have a refrigeration system and/or a heating system housed in the cabinet <b>5</b> that regulates the temperature of the food pans <b>27</b>. The product server <b>1</b> of the present invention is particularly useful in storing hot or cold food products that can be used by food service employees to prepare a food order on the counter top <b>31</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment, the support frame <b>9</b> comprises a pair of upright frame members <b>39</b>, <b>41</b> extending up from the cabinet <b>5</b> adjacent each side of the product server <b>1</b>. One frame member <b>39</b> of each pair is located near the rear <b>17</b> of the product server <b>1</b> and the other frame member <b>41</b> of each pair is located near the front <b>13</b> of the server. In one embodiment, each of the two rear frame members <b>39</b> is generally an upright frame member that extends vertically from the top surface <b>31</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b>. Each of the front frame members <b>41</b> has a short vertical lower section <b>45</b> that extends upward from the top surface <b>31</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b> and an angled upper section <b>47</b> that slopes up toward the rear <b>17</b> of the cabinet. The frame <b>9</b> has a top shelf <b>51</b> spaced above the cabinet <b>5</b> that is supported by the frame members <b>39</b>, <b>41</b> and affixed thereto. It will be understood that the top shelf <b>51</b> may be made of suitable metal (e.g., stainless steel or galvanized steel) and affixed to the frame members <b>39</b>, <b>41</b> via any conventional fasteners such as threaded fasteners, rivets, or welded connections. The top shelf <b>51</b> is particularly useful in supporting a menu board (not shown) or other item(s) displaying information regarding the products held within the server <b>1</b>. It will be understood that the product server <b>1</b> could include one or more side panels (not shown) affixed to the frame members <b>39</b>, <b>41</b> at each side of the server. These side panels may be made from the same material as the top shelf <b>51</b> or may have one or more transparent windows for viewing products within the server <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the breath guard <b>21</b> comprises a panel <b>61</b> that, in the illustrated embodiment, is a rectangular panel moveably mounted on the product server <b>1</b>. The panel <b>61</b> is preferably sufficiently transparent to allow viewing of at least some of the products held within the server <b>1</b>. For example, the panel <b>61</b> may be of acrylic or glass. The panel <b>61</b> is generally moveable between a lowered position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, preventing access to the food pans <b>27</b> held in the cabinet <b>5</b> and a raised position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, allowing access to the food pans from the employee side <b>17</b> of the server <b>1</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the panel <b>61</b> is supported by a metal (e.g., stainless steel) frame <b>65</b> around the periphery of the panel. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a handle <b>69</b> on the top side of the panel <b>61</b> extends up from the frame <b>65</b> for grasping by an operator. The panel <b>61</b> has a seal <b>73</b> made of resilient material (e.g., rubber) around the periphery of the bottom side of the panel <b>61</b> for sealing contact with the top surface <b>31</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b> when the panel is in the lowered position. The seal <b>73</b> allows the food products held within the food pans <b>27</b> to remain fresh when the panel <b>61</b> is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the panel <b>61</b> is pivotably attached to the cabinet <b>5</b> by two hinge connections, generally designated <b>81</b>, on the top of the cabinet adjacent opposite sides of the cabinet generally near the front <b>13</b> of the server <b>1</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each hinge connection <b>81</b> comprises a hinge block <b>85</b> secured to the top <b>31</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b> and a hinge pin <b>87</b> affixed to the frame <b>65</b> of the panel <b>61</b> and rotatable in a hole <b>89</b> in the block. Preferably, the hinge pins <b>87</b> are constructed from durable material with a low coefficient of friction (e.g., hard rubber) to allow the panel <b>61</b> to freely pivot with respect to the hinge block <b>85</b> affixed to the cabinet. In the illustrated embodiment, each hinge block <b>85</b> is constructed from a solid piece of steel (e.g., cold rolled or stainless steel) with a machined hole <b>89</b> for receiving a respective hinge pin <b>87</b>, but it will be understood that the hinge pins and hinge blocks could be constructed of other materials and have different configurations without departing from the scope of this invention. The pivoting action of the panel <b>61</b> allows the breath guard <b>21</b> to be positioned at any angular position between its lowered position in which the panel seals the food pans <b>27</b> held in the recess <b>23</b> of the cabinet <b>5</b> and its raised position in which the panel is position substantially parallel to the angled section <b>47</b> of the front frame members <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The product server <b>1</b> of the present invention also comprises two pairs of power assist devices <b>95</b>, <b>97</b> located on top of the cabinet <b>5</b> and operatively attached to the breath guard <b>21</b> adjacent opposite sides of the product server. In one embodiment, each pair of power assist devices at a respective side of the breath guard <b>21</b> comprises a gas spring <b>95</b> toward the rear <b>17</b> of the server <b>1</b> and a damper <b>97</b> toward the front <b>13</b> of the server. Each gas spring <b>95</b> is pivotably attached at one end to the top surface <b>31</b> of the counter <b>5</b> and at its other end to the metal frame <b>65</b> of the breath guard panel <b>61</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each gas spring <b>95</b> comprises a nitrogen gas spring of conventional construction such as the type that is commercially available from H.A. Guden Company of Ronkonkoma, N.Y. It will be understood that other types of power assist devices (e.g., pneumatic or hydraulic operated cylinders) are within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each gas spring <b>95</b> generally comprises a cylinder <b>105</b> having a closed end fitting <b>109</b> for connection to the product server <b>1</b> and a piston assembly including a piston <b>113</b> that is moveable within the cylinder and a piston rod <b>115</b> extending from the rod end of the cylinder. A rod end fitting <b>119</b> similar to the closed end fitting <b>109</b> is attached to the end of the piston rod <b>115</b> for attachment of the gas spring <b>95</b> to the glass panel <b>61</b>. The rod end fitting <b>119</b> on the piston rod <b>115</b> is moveable with the rod as the piston <b>113</b> moves inside the cylinder <b>105</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b>. In one embodiment, the cylinder <b>105</b> of each gas spring <b>95</b> contains pressurized nitrogen gas that exerts a force against the piston <b>113</b> that moves it toward the rod end of the cylinder, thus extending the piston rod <b>115</b> from the cylinder. It will be understood that the amount of output force exerted by the gas spring <b>95</b> is directly proportional to the force exerted by the gas in the cylinder <b>105</b> on the piston <b>113</b> and the size of the piston rod <b>115</b> affixed to the piston. As a result, the force exerted by the gas spring <b>95</b> will vary between a maximum value when the piston <b>113</b> is fully retracted into the cylinder <b>105</b> at the beginning of its stroke and a minimum value when the piston rod <b>115</b> is fully extended at the end of its stroke. Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,194,731 and 5,797,593, incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, for additional background information relating to gas springs and their internal components.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each rod end fitting <b>119</b> and closed end fitting <b>109</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b> comprises a socket connector attached to the corresponding rod <b>115</b> of the gas spring or the closed end of the cylinder <b>105</b>. Each socket connector <b>109</b>, <b>119</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b> receives a respective ball connector <b>125</b>, <b>127</b> affixed to a corresponding bracket <b>129</b>, <b>131</b> on the product server <b>1</b> and on the panel <b>61</b> to form a snap-on ball and socket attachment that allows the cylinder <b>105</b> to pivot as the panel is raised and lowered. The ball and socket connection formed by the socket connector <b>109</b> and the ball connector <b>125</b> at the closed end of the cylinder <b>105</b> allows the gas spring <b>95</b> to pivot about a fixed point on the product server <b>1</b> as the panel <b>61</b> is moved. The ball and socket connection formed by the socket connector <b>119</b> and the ball connector <b>127</b> at the rod end of the gas spring <b>95</b> allows the panel <b>61</b> to pivot with respect to the gas spring. The gas springs <b>95</b> may be connected to the cabinet <b>5</b> and panel <b>61</b> in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each gas spring <b>95</b> applies an axial force tending to extend the piston rod <b>115</b> away from the closed end of the cylinder <b>105</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the gas spring <b>95</b> is positioned so that when the panel <b>61</b> is raised by a manual lifting force, each cylinder <b>105</b> pivots so that the vertical component of the extension force of the gas spring increases to assist in raising the panel. It will be understood that the size, location and amount of extension force required of the gas spring <b>95</b> will depend on the size and weight of the glass panel <b>61</b>, the friction forces in the hinge connection <b>81</b> of the panel, and the amount of lifting force that is desired to assist in raising the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment, the second power assist device <b>97</b> comprises a damper that provides a dampening force to restrain movement of the panel <b>61</b> from its raised to its lowered position. The purpose of the damper <b>97</b> is to slow the downward movement of the glass panel <b>61</b> so the panel is not damaged by rapid uncontrolled movement from its raised to its lowered position. In the illustrated embodiment, the damper <b>97</b> is of the type commercially available from H.A. Guden Company of Ronkonkoma, N.Y. The damper <b>97</b> is similar in appearance and construction as the gas spring <b>95</b> but does not have a nitrogen gas charge causing a force to be exerted on the panel <b>61</b>. Rather the damper <b>97</b> is a force-absorbing device that is configured so that the piston rod <b>135</b> can only be extended from the cylinder <b>137</b> at a controlled speed. For example, the damper <b>97</b> may comprise a cylinder <b>137</b> filled with hydraulic fluid, and a piston <b>139</b> with a small orifice (not shown) for passing the fluid as the piston reciprocates in the cylinder, thus controlling the speed of stroke of the piston in the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each damper <b>97</b> has similar mounting components as the gas springs <b>95</b> and is affixed to the panel <b>61</b> and the cabinet <b>5</b> of the food server <b>1</b> with a snap-on ball and socket connection at each end of the damper. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, each damper <b>97</b> has a closed end fitting <b>145</b> comprising a socket connector attached to the cylinder <b>137</b> and pivotably attached to a ball connector <b>147</b> affixed to a bracket <b>151</b> mounted to the angled upper section <b>47</b> of the front frame member <b>41</b>. Each damper <b>97</b> also has a rod end fitting <b>155</b> comprising a socket connector attached to the piston rod <b>135</b> extending from the cylinder <b>137</b> and pivotably attached to a ball connector <b>159</b> affixed to a bracket <b>161</b> secured to the frame <b>65</b> of the panel <b>61</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the damper <b>97</b> is attached to the panel <b>61</b> at a point forward of the bracket <b>131</b> connecting the gas spring <b>95</b> to the panel <b>61</b>, but it will be understood that the damper could be otherwise located. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the ball and socket connection formed by the socket connector <b>145</b> and ball connector <b>147</b> connecting the damper <b>97</b> to the frame <b>9</b> allows the damper to pivot around a fixed point on the angled upper section <b>47</b> of the frame when the panel <b>61</b> is moved. The ball and socket connection formed by the socket connector <b>155</b> and the ball connector <b>159</b> connecting the damper <b>97</b> to the panel <b>61</b> allows the panel to pivot with respect to the damper. The damper <b>97</b> may be connected to the frame <b>9</b> and panel <b>61</b> in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one exemplary embodiment, the gas spring <b>95</b> and the damper <b>97</b> each have a stroke of about 3 inches, an extended length of about 10 inches, a retracted length of about 7 inches, a piston rod diameter of about &#xbc; inch, and a cylinder inner diameter of about 0.6 inch. In one embodiment, the output force of the gas spring <b>95</b> at full retraction is approximately 20 lbs. It will be understood that the gas spring <b>95</b> and damper <b>97</b> described above can have other dimensions and can be otherwise arranged without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, the breath guard <b>21</b> mounted on the server <b>1</b> of the present invention is pivotable between the lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3A</figref> and the raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>C, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The lowered position of the breath guard <b>21</b> allows the panel <b>61</b> to effectively seal the food pans <b>27</b> held in the temperature controlled cabinet <b>5</b> of the server <b>1</b>. The raised position of the breath guard <b>21</b> allows access to the products held within the server <b>1</b> from the employee side <b>17</b> and also protects the products from airborne contaminates originating from the customer side <b>13</b> of the server.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, each gas spring <b>95</b> is positioned to be substantially parallel with the glass panel <b>61</b> when the panel is in its lowered position so that the vertical component of the spring force is minimal. In the lowered position, the vertical component of the spring force of the gas spring <b>95</b> does not overcome the weight of the panel <b>61</b>. To raise the panel <b>61</b> from the lowered position an upward force is applied to the handle <b>69</b> of the panel to pivot the panel toward its raised position. As the panel <b>61</b> swings up, the piston rod <b>115</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b> extends from the cylinder <b>105</b> of the gas spring and the gas spring pivots, increasing the vertical component of the spring force. When the panel <b>61</b> is in an intermediate position (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the vertical component of the spring force balances the downward force of the panel due to the weight of the panel. In this intermediate position, the panel <b>61</b> is positioned at the self-rise angle S<b>1</b> of the breath guard <b>21</b> which is the position in which no additional lifting force is required to raise the panel to its raised position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The self-rise angle S<b>1</b> is typically between about 10 degrees and about 40 degrees with respect to the top counter <b>31</b> of the product server <b>1</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the self-rise angle S<b>1</b> is about 30 degrees and it will be understood that the magnitude of this angle will vary dependent on the size of the glass panel <b>61</b>, the size, location, and output force of the gas springs <b>95</b>, and the friction losses in the hinge connections <b>81</b> and the gas spring connections. At the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the panel <b>61</b> is raised to its most near-vertical position allowed by the configuration of the breath guard <b>21</b>. In this raised position, the panel <b>61</b> is positioned to allow full access to the products held within the product server <b>1</b> and to provide a barrier to contamination from the customer side <b>13</b> of the server. In the illustrated embodiment, the angle of incline at the raised position is approximately 70 degrees but it will be understood that this angle may vary between approximately 45 degrees and approximately 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dampers <b>97</b> are configured to resist downward movement of the panel <b>61</b> so that the panel is lowered from the raised position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> to the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> by controlled movement that prevents damage to the panel. In the intermediate position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the panel <b>61</b> is also positioned at the self-close angle S<b>1</b> of the breath guard, which is the angle at which the panel will close without the application of downward force by the operator. At the self-close angle, the downward force from the weight of the panel <b>61</b> is sufficient to overcome the vertical component of the gas spring force so that no supplemental closing force is needed. It will be understood that the breath guard <b>21</b> may be configured so that the self-close angle is more or less than 30 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The self-close angle may vary depending on the positioning of the gas springs <b>95</b> and the friction forces of the hinge connections <b>81</b> on the server.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> thru <b>3</b>C, the rod end fitting <b>119</b> of each gas spring <b>95</b> travels along the arc designated A<b>1</b> when the panel is moved between its lowered and raised positions. The arc A<b>1</b> of the gas spring extends between the minimum extension radius R<b>1</b> of the spring and the maximum extension radius R<b>2</b> of the spring. Similarly, the rod end fitting <b>155</b> of each damper <b>97</b> travels along the arc designated A<b>2</b> when the panel is moved between its lowered and raised positions. The arc A<b>2</b> of the damper extends between the minimum extension radius of the damper R<b>3</b> and the maximum extension radius R<b>4</b> of the damper. The distance between respective minimum extension radii R<b>1</b>, R<b>3</b> and respective maximum extension radii R<b>2</b>, R<b>4</b> of the spring <b>95</b> and the damper <b>97</b> is equal to the stroke length of each respective power assist device. In the illustrated embodiment, the stroke length of both the gas spring <b>95</b> and the damper <b>97</b> is approximately 3 inches, but the spring and the damper could be otherwise configured so that the stroke length may vary without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the product server, generally designated <b>185</b>, having a breath guard <b>191</b> which is substantially similar to the breath guard <b>21</b> of the previous embodiment except the gas spring <b>95</b> is mounted on the breath guard in an inverted position. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the gas spring <b>95</b> is positioned so that rod end fitting <b>119</b> is attached to the bracket <b>129</b> mounted on the counter top <b>31</b> of the product server <b>1</b>. The closed end fitting <b>109</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b> is attached to the bracket <b>131</b> mounted to the glass panel <b>61</b>. In the operation of the breath guard <b>191</b>, the cylinder <b>105</b> of the gas spring <b>95</b> moves with the panel <b>61</b> so that as the panel is raised and lowered, the cylinder axially telescopes with respect to the piston <b>113</b> and piston rod <b>115</b> attached to the server <b>185</b> by the pivot connection between the rod end fitting <b>119</b> and the bracket <b>129</b>. The force exerted by the gas spring <b>95</b> tends to move the cylinder <b>105</b> away from the rod end fitting <b>119</b> to assist in moving the panel <b>61</b> to the raised position of the breath guard <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention are achieved and other advantageous results attained. For example, the product server <b>1</b> with the generally transparent moveable panel <b>61</b> of the breath guard <b>21</b> allows products held in the server to be displayed to customers from the customer side <b>13</b> of the server. The panel <b>61</b> is pivotable to allow access to the products from the employee side <b>17</b> of the server <b>1</b>. The panel <b>61</b> has a seal <b>73</b> that contacts the top of the server <b>1</b> when the panel <b>61</b> is in its lowered position to protect products in the server from contamination. When the panel <b>61</b> is raised, the breath guard <b>21</b> presents a barrier that prevents contamination of the products from the customer side <b>13</b> of the server. The product server has power assist devices in the form of gas springs <b>95</b>, for example, that assist in the pivotal movement of the panel <b>61</b> to its raised position and dampers <b>97</b> that provide for controlled downward movement of the panel to its lower position.</p>

For example, the shape and construction of the support frame <b>9</b> of the breath guard <b>21</b> may vary. Further, the type, size, number, and location of the power assist devices <b>95</b>, <b>97</b> may vary. The product server <b>1</b> could comprise a breath guard <b>21</b> that has only dampers <b>97</b> and no gas springs <b>95</b> or a breath guard that has only gas springs <b>95</b> and no dampers <b>97</b>. The number of dampers <b>97</b> and/or gas springs <b>95</b> can vary. The relative sizes of the moveable panel <b>61</b> of the breath guard <b>21</b> and the product storage section of the server <b>1</b> may also vary. Selected walls of the product server <b>1</b> may be used to display advertising, if desired.</p>
