<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a board embedding an electronic component (referred to as an electronic component embedded board) and its manufacturing method, and more particularly to an electronic component embedded board embedding an electronic component in a substrate having a multilayered wiring structure and its manufacturing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, high density of an electronic component such as a semiconductor chip has greatly advanced, thereby downsizing the electronic component. Correspondingly, there has been proposed an electronic component embedded board embedding an electronic component in a substrate having a multilayered wiring structure in which a plurality of insulating layers, wirings and vias are stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a sectional view of a related-art electronic component embedded board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an electronic component embedded board <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>101</b> and an electronic component <b>113</b>. The substrate <b>101</b> has a core substrate <b>102</b>, wirings <b>104</b> provided on the core substrate <b>102</b> and a multilayered wiring structure <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The multilayered wiring structure <b>103</b> is formed on the core substrate <b>102</b> with the wirings <b>104</b>. The multilayered wiring structure <b>103</b> includes insulating layers <b>106</b> to <b>108</b> stacked on the core substrate <b>102</b>, wirings <b>109</b> to <b>111</b> formed on the insulating layers <b>106</b> to <b>108</b>, respectively, and vias (not shown) made in the insulating layers and electrically connecting these wirings <b>109</b> to <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electronic component <b>113</b> is formed on the wirings <b>104</b> and connected thereto. The electronic component <b>113</b> is covered with the insulating layers <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the electronic component embedded board <b>100</b> having such a configuration, after the wirings <b>104</b> have been formed on the core substrate <b>102</b>, the electronic component <b>113</b> is connected onto the wirings <b>104</b>. Thereafter, the insulating layers <b>106</b> to <b>108</b>, wirings <b>109</b> to <b>111</b> and vias (not shown), which constitute the multilayered wiring structure <b>103</b>, are formed (for example, see Patent Reference 1: Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 11-274734).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in a related-art electronic component embedded board <b>100</b>, after the electronic component <b>113</b> has been connected to the wirings <b>104</b>, the multiple-layer structure <b>103</b> is formed. Therefore, even where there is no problem in electric connection between the electronic component <b>113</b> and the wirings <b>104</b>, if a malfunction (e.g. opening of the vias, or short-circuiting of the wirings) occurs in the wirings <b>109</b> to <b>111</b> and vias (not shown), the problem of reduction in the yield of the electronic component embedded board <b>100</b> was presented.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The conductive member <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> is formed in the through hole <b>56</b>-<b>2</b> and electrically communicates the wiring <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> with the connecting area <b>47</b>A-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, also in the electronic component embedded board <b>70</b> in which three substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> are stacked so that the electronic components <b>13</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>13</b>-<b>2</b> are arranged between the substrates adjacent to each other in a vertical direction (in this embodiment, between the first substrate <b>11</b> and the second substrate <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> and between the second substrate <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> and the second substrate <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>) and the substrates adjacent to each other in the vertical direction are bonded by the photosensitive resins <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b> having adhesion, the same effect as in the electronic component embedded board <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this embodiment, the case where the three substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> are stacked was adopted. However, also in the electronic component embedded board in which three or more substrates are stacked so that the electronic components <b>13</b> are arranged between the substrates adjacent in the vertical direction and the substrates adjacent in the vertical direction are bonded by the photosensitive resins <b>14</b> having adhesion, the same effect as in the electronic component embedded board <b>10</b> can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, in this embodiment, the photosensitive resin having adhesion was explained as an example of the resin sealing the electric component and bonding the first substrate and the second substrate to each other. However, in place of the photosensitive resin having adhesion, NCF, NCP, ACF, ACP or underfill resin can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, the electronic component embedded board <b>70</b> can be manufactured in the same method as the method for manufacturing the electronic component embedded board <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Hitherto, the preferred embodiments of this invention have been explained in detail, However, this invention should not be limited to these specific embodiments but may be modified or changed in various manners within a scope of the spirit of this invention described in claims.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">This invention is applicable to the electronic component embedded board and its manufacturing method capable of the yield.</p>
