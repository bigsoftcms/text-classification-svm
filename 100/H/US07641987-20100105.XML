<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an organic electroluminescent device (hereinafter abbreviated as &#x201c;OELD&#x201d;) capable of converting electrical energy into light to emit light. The OELD of the invention is suited for use in the fields of display devices, displays, backlights, light sources for illumination, recording, exposure or reading, signs or signboards, interior decorations, optical communications, and so forth.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">OELDs have been actively studied and developed because of their capabilities of emitting light of high brightness at a low driving voltage. An OELD generally comprises a pair of opposing electrodes having therebetween a light emitting layer or a plurality of organic layers including a light emitting layer. With an electric field applied to the opposing electrodes, electrons and positive holes are injected from the cathode and the anode, respectively, into the light emitting layer, where they are recombined to form excitons, which emit light. Otherwise, energy is transferred from the excitons to create excitons of other molecules, which emit light. The light thus emitted from the light emitting layer is utilized to display an image.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the purpose of improving driving durability of OELDs, it has been proposed to use a metal complex as a host material in the light emitting layer as disclosed, e.g., in JP-A-2002-305083. There still has been room for further improvement on efficiency and durability.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide an OELD exhibiting high luminance, high luminescence efficiency, and satisfactory durability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the invention is accomplished by an OELD comprising a pair of electrodes and at least one organic compound layer including a light emitting layer provided in between the electrodes, the light emitting layer containing at least one host material and at least one luminescent material, wherein the host material is a compound represented by formula (I):</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Comparative Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">N,N&#x2032;-Diphenyl-N,N&#x2032;-di(m-tolyl)benzidine (TPD) was deposited on a cleaned ITO substrate by vacuum evaporation to a thickness of 50 nm. Compound B shown below (compound H-12 described in JP-A-2002-305083) and compound (12-1) were vacuum co-deposited on the TPD layer at a weight ratio of 34:2 to a deposition thickness of 36 nm. Compound A shown below was vacuum deposited thereon to a thickness of 36 nm. A pattern mask (having a pattern giving a light-emitting area of 4 mm by 5 mm) was put on the thus formed organic thin film, and cathodic deposition was made (lithium fluoride was vacuum deposited to a thickness of about 1 nm, and aluminum was then vacuum deposited to a thickness of about 200 nm) to complete a device. On applying a constant DC voltage to the resulting OLED by use of Source-Measure Unit Model 2400 supplied by Toyo Corp., blue light emission was obtained. The luminance of the blue light emission was measured with a luminance meter BM-8 supplied by Topcon. As a result, EL<sub>max </sub>was 489 nm, and the external quantum efficiency was 2.5%.</p>
