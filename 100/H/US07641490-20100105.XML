<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a liquid-cooled inverter and, more particularly, to a liquid-cooled inverter assembly of the type employed in an electric or hybrid vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Inverter assemblies are commonly employed in hybrid and electric vehicles to provide three phase operating power to an electric drive motor. In general, such inverter assemblies include a plurality of inverter switches mounted on a substrate. The inverter switches are electrically coupled between a direct current (DC) power source, such as a battery, and the electric drive motor by way of a bus bar. A capacitor may be electrically coupled between the bus bar and the DC power source to regulate fluctuations in voltage; however, depending upon the proximity of the capacitor to the switches, the capacitor may potentially induce voltage overshoots in the system. The inverter switches oscillate between open and closed positions to convert the direct current into alternating current (e.g., three phase alternating current) suitable for driving the vehicle's electric drive motor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During operation of the inverter assembly, the inverter switches, the bus bar, and the capacitor generate heat and may consequently require thermal regulation to ensure proper functioning. For this reason, the inverter assembly may be provided with a liquid-cooling system, which actively circulates a dielectric coolant fluid over the active switches. However, the dielectric fluid may not contact and cool the bus bar, which is spatially offset from the substrate and the inverter switches. As a result, the liquid-cooling system may not achieve optimal cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It should thus be appreciated that it would be desirable to provide a liquid-cooled inverter assembly having a substrate with an integrated bus bar wherein the cooling system directs coolant over the inverter switches, the substrate, and the integrated bus bar to thereby cool the inverter assembly in a more efficient manner. It would also be desirable if the liquid-cooled inverter assembly included a capacitor and a means for the cooling thereof (e.g., a heat sink). Preferably, the liquid-cooled inverter assembly would be configured such that the capacitor resides proximate the substrate and inverter switches so as to minimize inductive interference. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An inverter assembly includes a housing and a substrate disposed in the housing.

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary, or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified functional view of an electric drive system <b>10</b> employing a liquid-cooled inverter assembly <b>11</b> in accordance with a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Inverter assembly <b>11</b> is coupled between a direct current (DC) power source <b>12</b> (e.g., one or more batteries and/or fuel cells) and an electric motor <b>14</b> of the type deployed on an electric or hybrid vehicle (e.g., a three phase motor). Inverter assembly <b>11</b> converts direct current supplied by battery <b>12</b> into an alternating current (AC) suitable for driving electric motor <b>14</b>. In particular, inverter assembly <b>11</b> may provide three phase operating power to electric motor <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Inverter assembly <b>11</b> includes a multi-layer substrate <b>16</b>, which supports a plurality of power semiconductor devices (e.g., inverter switches) <b>18</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, substrate <b>16</b> includes three layers: a top conductive layer <b>20</b> (e.g., copper), a middle insulative layer <b>22</b> (e.g., a ceramic, such as aluminum oxide or silicon nitride), and a bottom conductive layer <b>24</b> (e.g., copper). Switches <b>18</b> are preferably soldered to top conductive layer <b>20</b>, although it should be appreciated that other attachment means may be utilized. A current-carrying bus bar is integrated into at least one layer of multi-layer substrate <b>16</b>. For example, top conductive layer <b>20</b> may be patterned to include a bus bar, which carries current to and from inverter switches <b>18</b>. More specifically, top conductive layer <b>20</b> may be patterned to include at least two current paths; i.e., a DC path <b>26</b> and an AC path <b>28</b>. If desired, top conductive layer <b>20</b> may also be patterned to include a control signal path <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, DC path <b>26</b> may be coupled to battery <b>12</b> via electrical connections <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, and AC path <b>28</b> may be coupled to electric motor <b>14</b> via electrical connection <b>37</b>. A third electrical connection <b>38</b> may further couple control signal path <b>30</b> to control circuitry <b>40</b> mounted on, for example, a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>42</b> (e.g., a gate driver board). In one option, control circuitry <b>40</b> and PCB <b>42</b> are combined into a single circuit card. During the operation of inverter assembly <b>11</b>, control circuitry <b>40</b> sends control signals over connection <b>38</b> and path <b>30</b>, which command switches <b>18</b> to alternate between open and closed positions so as to convert the direct current received from battery <b>12</b> into alternating current suitable for driving electric motor <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A capacitor bank <b>32</b> may be electrically coupled between battery <b>12</b> and DC path <b>26</b> of conductive layer <b>20</b> to regulate voltage fluctuations (e.g., smooth out any voltage spikes) that may be produced by battery <b>12</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, battery <b>12</b> is coupled to capacitor bank <b>32</b> by way of a first electrical connection <b>34</b>, and capacitor bank <b>32</b> is coupled to DC path <b>26</b> by way of a second electrical connection <b>36</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, capacitor bank <b>32</b> may be combined with the other components of inverter assembly <b>11</b> into a single module. In this case, capacitor bank <b>32</b> is preferably positioned proximate substrate <b>16</b> and inverter switches <b>18</b>. For example, capacitor bank <b>32</b> may be positioned such that its upper surface resides adjacent, and possibly contacts, a surface of substrate <b>16</b> (e.g., the lower surface of lower conductive layer <b>24</b>). By positioning capacitor bank <b>32</b> near substrate <b>16</b> and inverter switches <b>18</b> in this manner, inductive interference may be minimized. This example notwithstanding, it should be appreciated that capacitor bank <b>32</b> may be positioned at other locations within the inverter module or, alternatively, capacitor bank <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">During operation of inverter assembly <b>11</b>, heat is generated by active inverter switches <b>18</b>. In addition, heat may be produced in substrate <b>16</b> and capacitor bank <b>32</b>. To dissipate this heat, substrate <b>16</b> may be placed in physical contact with another body. For example, lower conductive layer <b>24</b> may be mounted to the vehicle's chassis. In this manner, the temperature of inverter switches <b>18</b> and patterned upper conductive layer <b>20</b> may be regulated as heat conductively travels from conductive layer <b>20</b>, through insulative layer <b>22</b> and lower conductive layer <b>24</b>, and into the vehicle's chassis (or other such body). In addition, capacitor bank <b>32</b> may also be placed in physical contact with substrate <b>16</b> (e.g., lower conductive layer <b>24</b>) so that the heat generated thereby may be dissipated in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To further increase heat dissipation, inverter assembly <b>11</b> may be equipped with a liquid-cooling system <b>46</b>. Liquid-cooling system <b>46</b> is configured to circulate a coolant fluid over active inverter switches <b>18</b> to convectively cool switches <b>18</b>. This coolant fluid may also contact, and thus convectively cool, patterned conductive layer <b>20</b> of multi-layer substrate <b>16</b>. The coolant fluid circulated by liquid-cooling system <b>46</b> is preferably a dielectric liquid (e.g., fluorocarbon, silicone oil, or polyalphaolephin), although it will be appreciated that the particular coolant fluid selected will depend upon device chemistry and application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Liquid-cooling system <b>46</b> includes an outlet array <b>48</b>, a pump <b>50</b>, a cooling device <b>52</b>, and a flow passage <b>54</b> including an inlet or fluid pick-up <b>56</b>. Outlet array <b>48</b> may be formed from a variety of materials, including, but not limited to, various metals (e.g., aluminum, copper, etc.), alloys, and plastics (e.g., an injection-molded plastic). Outlet array <b>48</b> includes an internal conduit <b>58</b> and a plurality of impingement outlets <b>60</b> each fluidly coupled to conduit <b>58</b>. In one arrangement, outlet array <b>48</b> is disposed beneath PCB <b>42</b> and over switches <b>18</b> and substrate <b>16</b>. Impingement outlets <b>60</b> are positioned so as to direct circulating coolant fluid onto the top surfaces of active inverter switches <b>18</b> and/or patterned conductive layer <b>20</b> of substrate <b>16</b>; e.g., each of outlets <b>60</b> may be disposed substantially above a different one of inverter switches <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Impingement outlets <b>60</b> may assume any form suitable for directing circulating coolant fluid onto switches <b>18</b> and/or substrate <b>16</b>. For example, impingement outlets <b>60</b> may each take the form of one or more holes created through the underside of outlet array <b>48</b>. However, impingement outlets <b>60</b> each preferably comprise a fluid flow jet configured to create a stream of coolant fluid, or a spray nozzle configured to produce a fine or atomized mist. Embodiments of outlet array <b>48</b> may employ fluid flow jets, spray nozzles, or a combination of jets and nozzles depending upon desired performance characteristics. Spray nozzles tend to provide more efficient thermal cooling, while fluid flow jets help to preserve coolant fluid quality and may permit pump <b>50</b> to be of the low pressure variety thereby reducing cost and increasing system reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When pump <b>50</b> is energized, coolant fluid flows through flow passage <b>54</b>, into outlet array <b>48</b>, and over inverter switches <b>18</b> and substrate <b>16</b>. As the coolant fluid contacts switches <b>18</b> and substrate <b>16</b>, heat is convectively transferred from the active inverter switches <b>18</b> and upper conductive layer <b>20</b> to the coolant fluid. The heated fluid is then collected at fluid pick-up <b>56</b> and drawn through flow passage <b>54</b> by pump <b>50</b>. Cooling device <b>52</b> cools the heated coolant fluid as it flows through flow passage <b>54</b>. Cooling device <b>52</b> may comprise any device suitable for this purpose, including, but not limited to, various types of heat exchangers and heat sinks. Next, the cooled coolant fluid enters the inlet port of outlet array <b>48</b>. The coolant fluid flows along conduit <b>58</b> to impingement outlets <b>60</b>, which then direct the coolant fluid over the active inverter switches <b>18</b> and substrate <b>16</b>. This cycle is repeated to continually regulate the temperature of switches <b>18</b> and substrate <b>16</b>. By integrating the bus bar into substrate <b>16</b>, inverter assembly <b>11</b> permits liquid-cooling system <b>46</b> to simultaneously cool inverter switches <b>18</b> and current-carrying components of inverter assembly <b>11</b>, which increases the effectiveness of liquid-cooling system <b>46</b> and consequently the overall performance of inverter assembly <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Depending upon the temperature of inverter switches <b>18</b> and the characteristics of the chosen coolant fluid, some portion of the circulated coolant fluid may vaporize upon contacting inverter switches <b>18</b>. In this case, inverter assembly <b>11</b> may be provided with a condenser (not shown), which condenses the vaporized coolant fluid. The condensed coolant fluid then returns to the coolant fluid reservoir and is recirculated in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are isometric and exploded views, respectively, of a liquid-cooled inverter assembly <b>70</b> in accordance with a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Inverter assembly <b>70</b> includes a housing <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which may plastic or another suitable material. As shown in FIG. <b>3</b>, liquid-cooled inverter assembly <b>70</b> may include a capacitor bank <b>74</b> including a cover <b>75</b>, a conductive mount plate <b>76</b>, a plurality of inverter devices <b>78</b>, an annular outlet array (e.g., a spray array) <b>80</b>, and a gate driver board <b>82</b>, which may be disposed within housing <b>72</b> in a stacked configuration as described (housing <b>72</b> and a pie-shaped section of gate driver board <b>82</b> and of spray array <b>80</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for clarity).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Inverter devices <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) each include a multi-layer substrate <b>84</b>, which supports a plurality of power semiconductor devices (e.g., switches <b>85</b>). As was the case previously, each substrate <b>84</b> includes a bus bar integrally formed thereon, which includes an AC path, a DC path, and a control signal path. The AC path includes an AC terminal <b>86</b>, which may reside on an inner tab of substrate <b>84</b> in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The DC path includes first and second DC terminals <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> having opposite polarities (e.g., DC terminals <b>88</b> may be positive, and DC terminals <b>90</b> may be negative). In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, each DC terminal <b>88</b> resides on an outer tab of substrate <b>84</b>, and each DC terminal <b>90</b> resides on conductive mount plate <b>76</b>, which functions as a current carrying bus-structure electrically coupled to substrate <b>84</b>. This example notwithstanding, DC terminal <b>90</b> may be incorporated directly into substrate <b>84</b> and mount plate <b>76</b> may be removed from inverter assembly <b>70</b> in alternative embodiments. In this case, each substrate <b>84</b> may be placed in direct physical contact with cover <b>75</b> to heat sink capacitor bank <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an isometric view of inverter devices <b>78</b>, substrates <b>84</b>, mount plate <b>76</b>, and capacitor bank <b>74</b> in an assembled state. As can be seen, inverter devices <b>78</b> are disposed upon substrates <b>84</b>, which, in turn, are disposed upon the upper surface of cover <b>75</b>. First and second pluralities of conductive lugs <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are disposed through the apertures provided through DC terminals <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, respectively. Lugs <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> extend through a plurality of channels <b>91</b> provided through cover <b>75</b> to electrically couple the integrated bus of each substrate <b>84</b> to capacitor bank <b>74</b>. Capacitor bank <b>74</b> is, in turn, coupled to a direct current source (not shown), such as a battery of the type described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A third plurality of conductive lugs <b>96</b> extends through the apertures provided through AC terminals <b>86</b>. The exposed ends of the conductive lugs <b>96</b> are electrically coupled to an electric motor (not shown). As an example, housing <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be mounted on the electrical motor (e.g., bolted to the bell end of the motor) and exposed conductive lugs <b>92</b> may be electrically coupled to the windings thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described previously, gate driver board <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) commands switches <b>85</b> to oscillate between open and closed positions. To enable command signals to be sent from gate driver board <b>82</b> to switches <b>85</b>, at least one electrical connection is formed between gate driver board <b>82</b> and the patterned conductive layer (or layers) of substrate <b>84</b>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of spring pins <b>98</b> are utilized to electrically couple board <b>82</b> to the patterned conductive layer of substrate <b>84</b>. Each spring pin <b>98</b> may pass through a guide channel <b>100</b> provided through spray array <b>80</b>. When inverter assembly <b>70</b> is assembled, spring pins <b>98</b> are compressed between a lower surface of gate driver board <b>82</b> and an upper surface (i.e., the patterned surface) of substrate <b>84</b>. If desired, spring pins <b>98</b> may be soldered or welded to gate driver board <b>82</b> and/or substrate <b>84</b>, although such a rigid coupling is by no means necessary. In addition, it should be appreciated that other electrical connections means may be utilized including, for example, wires and straight pins, which may pass through, or may be routed around, spray array <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the electrical connections may comprise a tab extending from each substrate <b>84</b>, which may be bent upward to contact gate driver board <b>82</b> and possibly soldered thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, spray array <b>80</b> is positioned within housing <b>72</b> so as to direct coolant fluid over inverter devices <b>78</b> and substrates <b>84</b> (e.g., spray array <b>80</b> may be disposed above inverter devices <b>78</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). To provide spray array <b>80</b> with a continuous coolant supply, inverter assembly <b>70</b> may be coupled to a coolant circulation system <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which continually exchanges coolant with inverter assembly <b>70</b>. In one option, coolant circulation system <b>102</b> comprises a cooling device (e.g., a heat exchanger) <b>106</b> and a pump <b>110</b>. Coolant circulation system <b>102</b> is coupled to an inlet <b>112</b> and an outlet <b>114</b> provided on inverter assembly <b>70</b> by way of a fluid delivery tube <b>116</b> and a fluid removal tube <b>118</b>, respectively. Coolant circulation system <b>102</b> removes heated coolant fluid from assembly <b>70</b> via fluid removal tube <b>118</b>, cools the heated coolant fluid, and then returns the fluid via fluid delivery tube <b>116</b>. The cooled coolant fluid received at inlet <b>112</b> is provided to spray array <b>80</b>, which then directs the fluid over inverter devices <b>78</b> and substrate <b>84</b> in the manner described above. This example notwithstanding, it should be appreciated that cooling device <b>106</b> and, perhaps, other components of coolant circulation system <b>102</b> may be incorporated into inverter assembly <b>70</b> (e.g., built into the cover of the unit).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The integration of a bus bar into each substrate <b>84</b> permits spray array <b>80</b> to simultaneously direct coolant fluid over inverter switches <b>85</b> and the current-carrying layer of substrate <b>84</b>. This increases the thermal efficiency of the liquid cooling system and, therefore, the overall performance of liquid-cooled inverter assembly <b>70</b>. In addition, conductive mount plate <b>76</b> may be placed in contact with cover <b>75</b> and consequently serve as a heat sink for capacitor bank <b>74</b>. As further advantage, the coolant may contact, and thus convectively cool, mount plate <b>76</b>. As a still further advantage, capacitor bank <b>74</b> is positioned in close proximity to inverter switches <b>85</b> (e.g., the upper surface of capacitor bank <b>74</b> resides adjacent mount plate <b>76</b> and near the lower surface of substrate <b>84</b>), which minimizes the likelihood of electrical interference due to inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should thus be appreciated that there has been provided a liquid-cooled inverter assembly employing a substrate with an integrated bus bar that achieves greater thermal efficiency by cooling the inverter switches and the substrate/bus bar. In one option, the liquid-cooled inverter assembly employs a capacitor, which is cooled (e.g., placed in contact with a heat sink, such as a mount plate or a surface of the substrate) and which resides proximate the inverter switches so as to minimize inductive interference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the foregoing has described substrates having a conductive layer (or layers) patterned to include an AC path, a DC path, and a control circuit path, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the patterned conductive layer need not include a control circuit path; instead, the control circuitry may be connected to the inverter switches through an emitter or collector disposed on the substrate (e.g., via a spring pin of the type described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be understood that the embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims and the legal equivalents thereof.</p>
