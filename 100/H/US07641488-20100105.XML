<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-021958 filed on Jan. 31, 2007, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a connecting configuration for a flexible wired circuit board and an electronic device and, more particularly to a connecting configuration for a flexible wired circuit board and an electronic device including the connecting configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A flexible wired circuit board, which is a thin wired circuit board excellent in flexibility, is disposed in the movable portion of an electronic device, such as a cellular phone, where the space is narrow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in a foldable cellular phone including an upper housing, a lower housing, and a hinge portion for supporting the upper housing and the lower housing openably/closably, it is proposed to dispose a flexible printed board (flexible wired circuit board) such that it is wound around the hinge portion to electrically connect the upper housing and the lower housing (see, e.g., the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 6,990,355 (FIG. 7)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, in recent years, a slidable cellular phone has been known which includes an upper housing and a lower housing without a hinge portion so that, when the lower housing is used, the lower housing is partly exposed from the upper housing by sliding the lower housing with respect to the upper housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a slidable cellular phone, a flexible wired circuit board electrically connecting the upper housing and the lower housing needs to correspond to a span over which the lower housing slides with respect to the upper housing. To satisfy the need, it is proposed to dispose an FPCB (flexible wired circuit board) in a meandering (S-shaped) shape in which linear flat-plate portions and curved bent portions having a small radius of curvature are alternately formed (see, e.g., the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 6,973,186 (FIG. 3)).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the slidable cellular phone described in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 6,973,186, the flexible wired circuit board is fatigued by continued use. More specifically, when the lower housing slides with respect to the upper housing to be exposed therefrom, the bent portions locally extend linearly. On the other hand, when the lower housing slides with respect to the upper housing to be covered therewith, the bent portions are locally curved. When such sliding of the lower housing with respect to the upper housing is repeated, the flexible wired circuit board is locally fatigued at the bent portions. As a result, the problem occurs that conductive wires in the bent portions are broken by the fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, in recent years, a slidable cellular phone has also been required to be thinner. However, when the slidable cellular phone is slimmed, the radius of curvature of the bent portions of the flexible wired circuit board is smaller so that the local fatigue mentioned above is more notable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connecting configuration for a flexible wired circuit board which allows effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern of the flexible wired circuit board resulting from continued use and an electronic device including the connecting configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A connecting configuration for a flexible wired circuit board according to the present invention comprises a first terminal member, a second terminal member, and a flexible wired circuit board having a conductive pattern for electrically connecting the first terminal member and the second terminal member, wherein the first terminal member and the second terminal member are provided such that at least one of the terminal members is linearly movable to be adjacent to and apart from the other terminal member, and the flexible wired circuit board is provided to be wound or twisted in a middle of a moving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board, the flexible wired circuit board is provided to be wound or twisted in the middle of the moving direction in which the first terminal member or the second terminal member linearly moves. Accordingly, when at least one of the first terminal member and the second terminal member linearly moves to be apart from the other, the wound part or the twisted part of the flexible wired circuit board in the middle of the moving direction extends, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound part or the twisted part gradually decreases. When at least one of the first terminal member and the second terminal member linearly moves to be adjacent to the other, the wound part or the twisted part of the flexible wired circuit board in the middle of the moving direction contracts, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound part or the twisted part gradually increases. This avoids local fatigue of the flexible wired circuit board and allows effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern of the flexible wired circuit board resulting from continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result, it is possible to reduce the thickness by decreasing the radius of curvature of the wound part or the twisted part and also ensure the reliability of electrical connection between the first terminal member and the second terminal member over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board, it is preferable that the flexible wired circuit board comprises a reinforcing layer formed on both end portions of the flexible wired circuit board in a direction perpendicular to the moving direction in the middle thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board, the reinforcing layer can reinforce the flexible wired circuit board in the middle of the moving direction. As a result, it is possible to extend or contract the wound part or the twisted part, while ensuring the rigidity of the flexible wired circuit board. This allows more effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern of the flexible wired circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is preferable that the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board further comprises a first supporting member that supports the first terminal member and a second supporting member that supports the second terminal member, wherein the first supporting member and the second supporting member are provided such that at least one of the supporting members is slidable with respect to the other supporting member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board, by sliding the first supporting member or the second supporting member, it is possible to ensure the linear movement of the first terminal member or the second terminal member and improve the connection reliability of the flexible wired circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the connecting configuration for the flexible wired circuit board, it is preferable that a twisted part or a wound part of the flexible wired circuit board is extendable and contractable along the moving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the first terminal member or the second terminal member linearly moves, the wound part or the twisted part extends or contracts along the moving direction. As a result, it is possible to efficiently reduce the stress exerted by the movement on the flexible wired circuit board. This allows more effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern resulting from local fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An electronic device according to the present invention comprises a first supporting member that supports a first terminal member, a second supporting member that supports a second terminal member, and a flexible wired circuit board having a conductive pattern for electrically connecting the first terminal member and the second terminal member, wherein the first supporting member and the second supporting member are provided such that at least one of the supporting members is slidable with respect to the other supporting member, and the flexible wired circuit board is provided to be wound or twisted in a middle of a sliding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the electronic device, the flexible wired circuit board is provided to be wound or twisted in the middle of the sliding direction in which the first terminal member or the second terminal member slides. Accordingly, when at least one of the first supporting member and the second supporting member slides to be apart from the other, the wound part or the twisted part of the flexible wired circuit board in the middle of the sliding direction extends, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound part or the twisted part gradually decreases. When at least one of the first supporting member and the second supporting member slides to be adjacent to the other, the wound part or the twisted part of the flexible wired circuit board in the middle of the sliding direction contracts, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound part or the twisted part gradually increases. This avoids local fatigue of the flexible wired circuit board and allows effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern of the flexible wired circuit board resulting from continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a result, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the electronic device by decreasing the radius of curvature of the wound part or the twisted part and also ensure the reliability of electrical connection between the first terminal member and the second terminal member over a long period of time.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The lower casing <b>23</b> is disposed to face the upper casing <b>22</b> in the thickness direction (vertical direction).

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> in the wound state described above has the front-side connecting terminal portions <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) connected to the upper connector <b>26</b> and the rear-side connecting terminal portions <b>7</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) connected to the lower connector <b>27</b>. As a result, the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> is provided to be wound in the middle of the longitudinal direction thereof between the upper casing <b>22</b> and the lower casing <b>23</b> and to electrically connect the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">During non-operation of the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the upper casing <b>22</b> is superimposed on the lower casing <b>23</b> in the thickness direction and disposed at the same position when viewed in plan view, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). When the use of the cellular phone <b>21</b> is started, the operation panel portion <b>29</b> of the lower casing <b>23</b> is exposed from the upper casing <b>22</b> by sliding the lower casing <b>23</b> toward one longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). By thus sliding the lower casing <b>23</b>, the lower connector <b>27</b> is linearly moved toward one longitudinal direction to be apart from the upper connector <b>26</b>, while the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> extends along the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">After the use of the cellular phone <b>21</b> is ended, the lower casing <b>23</b> is slid toward the other longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> such that the operation panel portion <b>29</b> of the lower casing <b>23</b> is covered with the upper casing <b>22</b>. By thus sliding the lower casing <b>23</b>, the lower connector <b>27</b> is linearly moved toward the other longitudinal direction to be adjacent to the upper connector <b>26</b>, while the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> contracts along the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> is provided to be wound in the moving direction in which the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b>, i.e., in the middle of the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Therefore, when the lower casing <b>23</b> slides toward one longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> to be apart therefrom, i.e., when the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves toward one longitudinal direction with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be apart therefrom, the wound portion in the middle of the longitudinal direction of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> extends, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound portion gradually decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On the other hand, when the lower casing <b>23</b> slides toward the other longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> to be adjacent thereto, i.e., when the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves toward the other longitudinal direction with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be adjacent thereto, the wound portion in the middle of the longitudinal direction of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> contracts, while the radius of curvature of the entire wound portion gradually increases.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">This avoids local fatigue of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> and allows effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern <b>3</b> of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> resulting from continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As a result, it is possible to reduce the thickness by decreasing the radius of curvature of the wound portion and ensure the reliability of electrical connection between the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b> over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Since the reinforcing layers <b>8</b> can reinforce the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> in the middle of the longitudinal direction thereof, it is possible to extend or contract the wound portion, while ensuring the rigidity of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>. This allows more effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern <b>3</b> of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the sliding of the lower casing <b>23</b> with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> ensures linear movement of the lower connector <b>27</b> with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b>. As a result, it is possible to ensure an improvement in the connection reliability of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>, while ensuring linear movement of the lower connector <b>27</b> with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b>, the wound portion extends or contracts along the moving direction, i.e., the longitudinal direction. This allows an efficient reduction in the stress exerted by the movement on the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>. As a result, a broken wire in the conductive pattern <b>3</b> resulting from local fatigue can be more effectively prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the description given above, the lower casing <b>23</b> is provided slidable with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b>. However, it is not limited thereto.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">To twist the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>, the same method as any of the winding methods mentioned above is used. The number of twisting the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> is the same as the above-mentioned number of winding the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, a description will be given to the cellular phone <b>21</b> as another embodiment of the electronic device including the connecting configuration according to the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> in the twisted state described above connects the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b>. As a result, the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> is provided to be twisted in the middle of the longitudinal direction between the upper casing <b>22</b> and the lower casing <b>23</b> and to electrically connect the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> is provided to be twisted in the moving direction in which the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b>, i.e., in the middle of the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Therefore, when the lower casing <b>23</b> slides toward one longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> to be apart therefrom, i.e., when the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves toward one longitudinal direction with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be apart therefrom, the twisted portion in the middle of the longitudinal direction of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> extends, while the radius of curvature of the entire twist portion gradually decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">On the other hand, when the lower casing <b>23</b> slides toward the other longitudinal direction with respect to the upper casing <b>22</b> to be adjacent thereto, i.e., when the lower connector <b>27</b> linearly moves toward the other longitudinal direction with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be adjacent thereto, the twisted portion in the middle of the longitudinal direction of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> contracts, while the radius of curvature of the entire twisted portion gradually increases.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">This avoids local fatigue of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> and allows effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern <b>3</b> of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> resulting from continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As a result, it is possible to reduce the thickness by decreasing the radius of curvature of the twisted portion and also ensure the reliability of electrical connection between the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b> over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>, the reinforcing layers <b>8</b> makes it possible to extend or contract the twisted portion, while ensuring the rigidity of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>. This allows more effective prevention of a broken wire in the conductive pattern <b>3</b> of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the description give above, the lower casing <b>23</b> is provided to be located under the upper casing <b>22</b> during non-operation of the cellular phone <b>21</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is also possible to provide an inner casing <b>32</b> as the second supporting member such that it is accommodated in an outer casing <b>31</b> as the first supporting member.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the cellular phone <b>21</b> includes the outer casing <b>31</b>, the inner casing <b>32</b>, and the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The outer casing <b>31</b> is formed in the shape of a box which is opened in one longitudinal direction. More specifically, the outer casing <b>31</b> includes an upper wall, a lower wall, and side walls coupling the respective peripheral ends of the upper wall and the lower wall, while the side way on the longitudinal side is opened. The outer casing <b>31</b> has an inner space formed between the upper wall and the lower wall to accommodate the inner casing <b>32</b>, described next. The outer casing <b>31</b> includes the liquid-crystal display portion <b>28</b> in the upper surface of the upper wall, and houses the upper substrate <b>24</b> on the other longitudinal side in the outer casing <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The upper substrate <b>24</b> includes the upper connector <b>26</b> provided on the lower surface of the upper substrate <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The upper connector <b>26</b> is disposed on the one longitudinal end portion of the upper substrate <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The inner casing <b>32</b> is formed in the shape of a box which is opened in the other longitudinal direction. More specifically, the inner casing <b>32</b> includes an upper wall, a lower wall, and side walls coupling the respective peripheral ends of the upper wall and the lower wall, while the side wall on the other longitudinal is opened. The inner casing <b>32</b> is formed to have a size so that the inner casing <b>32</b> can be accommodated in the outer casing <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>), the inner casing <b>32</b> is entirely accommodated in the inner space of the outer casing <b>31</b> during non-operation of the cellular phone <b>21</b>. The inner casing <b>32</b> includes the operation panel portion <b>29</b> in the upper surface of the upper wall and houses the lower substrate <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The lower substrate <b>25</b> is provided to face the upper substrate <b>24</b> in the longitudinal direction (sliding direction) so as not to overlap in the thickness direction. The lower substrate <b>25</b> includes the lower connector <b>27</b> provided on the upper surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The lower connector <b>27</b> is disposed on the other longitudinal end portion of the lower substrate <b>25</b> to face the upper connector <b>26</b> in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The inner casing <b>32</b> is coupled to the outer casing <b>31</b> by a slide mechanism not shown. The inner casing <b>32</b> is provided slidable with respect to the outer casing <b>31</b> in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> connects between the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b> and is twisted in the middle of the longitudinal direction of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">During non-operation of the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the inner casing <b>32</b> is accommodated in the outer casing <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>). When the use of the cellular phone <b>21</b> is started, the inner casing <b>32</b> is slid to be drawn from the outer casing <b>31</b> to expose the operation panel portion <b>29</b> of the inner casing <b>32</b> from the outer casing <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>). By sliding the inner casing <b>32</b>, the lower connector <b>27</b> is linearly moved with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be apart therefrom, while the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> extends along the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">When the use of the cellular phone <b>21</b> is ended, the inner casing <b>32</b> is slid to be contained in the outer casing <b>32</b> such that the operation panel portion <b>29</b> of the inner casing <b>32</b> is covered with the outer casing <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>). By sliding the inner casing <b>32</b>, the lower connector <b>27</b> is linearly moved with respect to the upper connector <b>26</b> to be adjacent thereto, while the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> contracts along the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">During non-operation of the cellular phone <b>21</b>, the inner casing <b>32</b> is accommodated in the outer casing <b>31</b> and the upper substrate <b>24</b> and the lower substrate <b>25</b> are provided to face in the longitudinal direction so as not to overlap each other in the thickness direction. As a result, it is possible to further reduce the thickness of the cellular phone <b>21</b> and also ensure the reliability of electrical connection between the upper connector <b>26</b> and the lower connector <b>27</b> over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the description given above, a single-sided flexible wired circuit board is used as an example of the flexible wired circuit board <b>1</b> used in the present invention.
