<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Anti-tamper (&#x201c;AT&#x201d;) protection is employed so that it is very difficult to reverse engineer or alter the function of electronic hardware (e.g., computer processors, integrated circuits, multi-chip modules, etc). For some commercial applications, designers often spend vast sums of money to develop a &#x201c;next generation&#x201d; circuit. These companies often wish to deter, or at least hamper a competitor's reverse engineering efforts. The motivation in this case is to protect valuable intellectual property. Military and Government users also have a strong interest in AT protection. When new military hardware is fielded, often the consequences of capture are not fully understood by the designer of the hardware. Similarly, the combat loss of any one of a thousand pieces of sensitive, high-tech military hardware could do irreparable damage to national security.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Most AT is categorized as either passive or active. In each case, the intent is to delay, prevent or stop tampering and potential reverse engineering of an electronic circuit. Passive AT is currently the most widespread method of deterring an opponent from reverse engineering or spoofing an electronic circuit. Current passive AT arrangements include encapsulation or various types of conformal coatings such as epoxies. Methods to defeat common encapsulants are well documented.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">AT standards have been defined according to the Federal Information Protection Standard (FIPS) 140-2. The standard describes the requirements for four levels of protection. For the standards for multi-chip, embedded modules, Level 1 calls for standard passivation techniques (i.e., a sealing coat applied over the chip circuitry to protect it against environmental or other physical damage). The standard describes that Level 2 can be achieved using anti-tamper coatings or passive AT. Level 3 may use passive AT if tampering will likely destroy the module. Level 4 requires the use of active AT technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Layered anti-tamper arrangements are also employed in which alternating layers of passive AT with active AT yields a synergy in probing difficulty. With active AT methods, a protected circuit will take some action when unauthorized activities are detected. Any number of events can trigger a programmed circuit response. Examples of active triggering arrangements include: voltage, photon detection, acceleration, strain, thermal, chemical attack, and proximity or tamper-respondent enclosures. A tamper-respondent package can theoretically detect probing by proximity detection or by an external activity mutilating an active circuit, exterior to what is being protected. The response of an active AT circuit upon triggering is also widely variable. For example, zeroization may be employed in which critical memory cells or an entire die can be erased. Similarly, a response can trigger overwriting of some or all of a memory die. Another detection response is to physically obliterate a critical circuit element or elements.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the present invention include an electronic device that has an anti-tampering mesh that is fabricated on the device. In various embodiments, the conductive mesh is defined by single or multiple conductive layers separated by alternating non-conductive (or dielectric) layers. The multiple conductive layers are electrically connected to the detection circuitry with the terminals by electrical vias extending through the dielectric layers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;electronic device&#x201d; can include, for example, any type of device or package such as a semiconductor device, an electronic package, an integrated circuit chip, device or module, an electronic or electrical substrate, a circuit board, a packaged circuit, a computer, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various embodiments of the present invention may include conductive materials for the various conductor patterns such as, for example, UV curable conductive polymers such as Ablelux HGA-3A, photo-imagable conductive polymers, heat cured conductive polymers, Papinol's polyaniline based inks, and/or silver, gold, aluminum, or Pd/Pt evaporated coatings. Various embodiments of the present invention may include dielectric materials such as, for example, photo-imagable photoresist such as Cyclotene (BCB) 4024-40, UV curable materials such as Dupont BQ411, UV solder masks such as Lite Fast SR-1000, and/or elastomeric dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be understood that various techniques may be employed to construct a mesh on an electronic device without departing from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the mesh may be constructed using various techniques that employ UV conductive polymers, and/or photo-imagable conductor polymers, evaporated coatings (thermal spray) of metals using, for example, e-beam technology or thermal or magnetron (sputtering) in conjunction with masks. The conductive traces can also be dispensed by depositing metal-filled or carbon-filled epoxies or other filled or otherwise conductive polymers by various syringe dispensing, screen printing and like methods. Also, it can be understood that the terminals <b>12</b> may be located randomly on any number of surfaces of the device <b>10</b>. Furthermore, it can be understood that the conductive traces may be formed in any suitable shape or pattern and be arranged in any suitable orientation. It can also be understood that the dielectric (non-conductive) layers can be dispensed by various printing, syringe dispensing, coating, or fluid dispensing methods. Numerous such methods should be obvious to one of average skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The techniques and structures of the various embodiments of the present invention may be used to detect tampering of an electronic device. In operation and according to various embodiments of the present invention, a resistance value of a mesh that is located on the device may be known after the mesh is formed on the device. The resistance may be monitored by, for example, a circuit located in the device and, if one or more of the lines of the mesh is broken or disrupted, a change in resistance can be detected by the circuit. Such a circuit may be, for example, a wheatstone bridge circuit. The mesh circuitry may also be monitored for changes in the capacitance of the network. In this case, it may also be possible to use the system of conducting mesh and dielectrics as a proximity detector.</p>
