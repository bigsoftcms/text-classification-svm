<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to an electronic assembly, and more particularly to an electronic assembly with a foldable connector thereof. The invention relates to the copending application having the same title, the same filing date, the same applicants and the same assignee therewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As development of an electronic technique, an electronic device becomes lower profile and multifunction. Some consumer products, especially those video/audio products, should be equipped with a lower profile power port and signal port. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,461,198, 6,038,766, 5,895,294 and TW Pat. 406884 introduce some related art of electrical connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,461,198 (hereinafter refer to U.S. '198) discloses audio connection apparatus. The connection apparatus includes plug and jack assemblies. The jack assembly defines a primary insertion hole and at least a pair of secondary insertion openings disposed laterally therefrom. The jack assembly includes a plurality of first conductive plates disposed in each of the secondary insertion openings. The plug assembly which releasably couples to the jack assembly includes a central shaft for engaging the primary insertion hole of the jack assembly in electrically conductive manner, as well as at least a pair of secondary insertions disposed laterally from the central shaft for respectively engaging the insertion openings of the jack assembly in electrically conductive manner. Each secondary insertion includes a plurality of second conductive plates each configured to contact a first conductive plate in electrically conductive manner. The engagement of the secondary insertions and secondary insertion openings enables the auxiliary transmission of electrical audio signals for supplementing the transmission of electrical audio signals through the engagement of the central shaft and primary insertion hole.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the plug assembly of U.S. '198 may be disposed outside of an electronic device, and it may occupy more space and be damaged by exterior environmental conditionals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, an improved electrical assembly is highly desired to overcome the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector capable of being retracted in a housing of an electronic assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the object set forth, an electronic assembly in accordance with the present invention comprises a housing having a plurality of walls together defining a receiving space and an outlet defined in one of the walls and in communication to the receiving space; a connector pivotally linked to the housing and projected outward of the housing via the outlet; a locking member mounted to the housing, said locking member including a base portion having a first side and a second side opposite to the first side, a stopper portion formed on the first side and extending into the receiving opening, and a resilient member arranged adjacent to the second side for exerting a resilient force to the base portion; and the connector being pivotal to push the stopper member together with the base portion of the locking member against the resilient member to enter into the receiving space and be locked by the stopper member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
