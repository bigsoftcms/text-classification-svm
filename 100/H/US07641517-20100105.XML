<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a device for holding a lamp, in particular a compact fluorescent lamp in a light fixture.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such a device is known, e.g. from the 2007 product catalog of the applicant as a holder for GR14q compact fluorescent lamps of the PL-R Eco type of the Philips company.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another device with which a compact fluorescent lamp 2 GB-1 can be installed by executing a plug-and-rotate motion is known from EP 1 348 902 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,275,854).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The considerable advantage of compact fluorescent lamps for illumination is due to their high illuminating power with low current consumption and their long service life. There are compact fluorescent lamps on the market in various wattage levels, classified according to their number of watts, so that there is a lamp with a suitable wattage for every application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is advantageous for the manufacturers of lighting units if the lamp holder or socket of a standard device only can accept lamps with a predetermined or a maximally admissible wattage and/or of a predetermined lamp type in the light fixture. This can ensure that the body of the light fixture, the reflector or, in the case of installed light fixtures, the parts surrounding the light fixtures are protected from too much heat from the lamp. Such a device did not exist up to the present in standard devices for holding compact fluorescent lamps.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a device for holding compact fluorescent lamps in which a lamp base can be fixed in a socket by a plug-and-rotate motion in such a manner as to can ensure that only suitable lamps can be inserted into the light fixture.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is attained by a device for holding a lamp IN which the cylindrical projection of the lamp base has a central plug projecting toward the socket, which plug forms a lamp key coded for a predetermined lamp wattage, and that the floor of the socket has a hole corresponding to the plug, which hole forms a socket key coded for the maximally admissible lamp wattage for the socket, and that the lamp base can only be inserted into the socket when the lamp wattage indicated by the lamp key does not exceed the maximally admissible lamp wattage defined by the socket key.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outer socket part key and the inner socket part key make it possible to prevent the insertion of lamps into light fixtures whose wattage is too great for the particular model of light fixture. Thus, this can effectively prevent damage from high temperatures as a consequence of the radiation of heat of the lamp inside the light fixture for the body of the light fixture or for the reflector as well as outside of the light fixture on mounting parts or parts of the surroundings. However, at the same time the key combinations make it possible to insert lamps with a lesser wattage than the maximal wattage permitted for the socket into a light fixture so that the user of the light fixture in question is otherwise free in his selection of the lamp wattage and illuminating wattage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, it is conceivable in one embodiment that the lamp base can only be fitted into the socket if the lamp key and the socket key are coded for the identical lamp wattage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the embodiment is preferred in which the socket key characterizing a predetermined lamp wattage allows the insertion of all lamp bases whose lamp keys coded for an identical or lesser lamp wattage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Concretely speaking, the keys are designed in such a manner that the socket key is constituted as a lug directed radially inward to the hole center and that the lamp key is designed as an outwardly open cutout of the plug.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Lamp bases for lower lamp wattages have wider outwardly open cutouts on the plug side than lamp bases for higher lamp wattages.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In conformity therewith the lug on the socket in sockets for higher admissible lamp wattages is offset relative to those with lower admissible lamp wattages by a predetermined angle counter to the rotary movement to be performed for installation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A concrete embodiment provides that the offset of the angle is 45&#xb0; per lamp wattage range and the outwardly open cutout is increased by 45&#xb0; per lamp wattage range toward the rotary movement to be performed for fixing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The previously cited concrete angles result in seven possible keys, taking into account tolerances for structural components, with which an insertion of a lamp with non-admissible lamp wattage is reliably avoided, taking into account the rotary motion of 30&#xb0; necessary for fixing. In this manner the number of keys is maximized while ensuring safety.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Just as a lamp wattage that is too high, even the wrong lamp type can result in damage to the light fixture. This can be imagined, e.g. if the light fixture for a lamp is intended for a long cylindrical lamp body and instead a lamp with a substantially spherical lamp body is inserted. The spherical lamp body has a greater diameter than the cylindrical lamp body and as a consequence less distance to the body of the light fixture. Even this can result in an inadmissible heating of the body of the light fixture, of the reflector or of the surroundings, resulting in thermal damage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The initially posed problem of a device is solved in this sense in that the cylindrical projection on the lamp base comprises at least one key recess on its outer circumference, which recess characterizes a predetermined lamp type and the collar on the socket has at least one key projection on its inner circumference and also coded for a predetermined lamp type, which socket can only be fitted into the socket if the key recess and the key projection are coded for compatible lamp types.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A preferred embodiment provides that up to five key recesses and up to five corresponding key projections are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For special applications an embodiment is provided that is characterized in that the socket can only be fitted into the socket if the key recess and the key projection are coded for identical lamp types.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Finally, the retaining formations on the lamp base are designed as retaining projections and the retaining formations on the socket are designed as L-shaped grooves so that the inner and outer retaining formations form a type of bayonet lock.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A socket is identified with reference numeral <b>10</b> and a lamp base with reference numeral <b>11</b> in all figures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As is apparent in particular from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the socket <b>10</b> is a substantially cylindrical body having a collar <b>12</b>. This collar <b>12</b> delimits a cup-shaped recess <b>13</b>. The cup-shaped recess <b>13</b> has a floor <b>14</b> formed with a central hole <b>17</b> in addition to four apertures <b>16</b> provided with unillustrated socket contacts. Approximately L-shaped collar grooves <b>18</b> form retaining formations <b>19</b> that cooperate with retaining formations <b>15</b> of the lamp base <b>11</b> formed as retaining projections <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the floor <b>14</b> of the recess <b>13</b> has a latches <b>21</b>. They are formed as circularly arcuate recesses formed in the floor <b>14</b> and having sawteeth <b>22</b> with, relative to a rotation sens V, a shallow flank <b>23</b> and a steep flank <b>24</b>. Finally, a lug <b>25</b> projects in the central hole <b>17</b> toward a center Z and functions as a socket key <b>26</b>. Here it is the socket key <b>26</b> of key pair <b>7</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a lamp base <b>11</b> by way of example. It comprises a substantially cylindrical projection <b>27</b> extending from a base fitting <b>42</b> and having the above-mentioned retaining projections <b>20</b> on its outer surface. The cylindrical projection <b>27</b> forms a lamp end face <b>28</b> from which projects a central plug <b>29</b>. This latter projects toward the socket <b>10</b>. An outwardly open cutout <b>30</b> forms a lamp key <b>31</b> of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The outwardly open cutout corresponds to the lamp key <b>31</b> of key pair <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the lamp end face <b>28</b> is provided with four seats <b>32</b> for unillustrated contact pins. Furthermore, the lamp end face <b>28</b> forms with the socket retaining formations <b>21</b> a catch <b>33</b>. Each catch is formed by two parallel and spaced slots <b>34</b> in the lamp end face <b>28</b> forming elastically deformable web <b>35</b> in the floor <b>38</b> between the two notches <b>34</b>, which web functions like a leaf spring. A projection <b>36</b> cooperates with the sawtooth <b>22</b> on the socket.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The L-shaped collar grooves <b>18</b> of the socket <b>10</b> that form the retaining formations <b>19</b> are nonuniformly angularly spaced from each other. Retaining projections <b>20</b> on the lamp base fit with the collar grooves <b>19</b>. The retaining projections <b>20</b> are angularly spaced from each other on the circumference and the distances between each corresponding collar grooves <b>18</b> or retaining projections <b>20</b> and the respective next collar groove <b>18</b> and/or retaining projection <b>20</b> are the same. This ensures that the lamp base <b>11</b> can only be inserted into socket <b>10</b> in a one angular position relative to the socket since only then can each retaining projection <b>20</b> fit into its corresponding collar groove <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It can be readily be seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> how the lamp base <b>11</b> is fitted into the socket <b>10</b> and locked therein. The lamp base <b>11</b> is aligned with its plug <b>29</b> to the hole <b>17</b>, care being taken that the lug <b>25</b> is aligned with the cutout <b>20</b> of the central plug <b>29</b>. A triangular symbol <b>37</b> carried on the lamp base <b>11</b> as well as on the socket <b>10</b> serves to show the final position of both parts relative to each other. In this position retaining formations <b>15</b> and <b>19</b> can fit together.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lamp base <b>11</b> is now inserted into the socket <b>10</b> with the retaining projections <b>20</b> fitting into the legs of the L-shaped collar grooves <b>18</b> that extend perpendicular to the socket floor <b>14</b>. At the same time the unillustrated lamp contact pins engage into the inner part apertures <b>16</b> and the protections <b>36</b> of the inner part catch <b>33</b> come to rest in front of the shallow flank <b>23</b> of the sawtooth <b>22</b> in the corresponding recess.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Subsequently, the lamp base is moved about 30&#xb0; in the retaining rotational sense V so that retaining projections <b>20</b> move into the legs of the collar grooves <b>18</b> extending parallel to the socket floor <b>14</b>, thereby effecting a bayonet-like locking of the lamp base <b>11</b> in the socket <b>10</b>. At the same time engagement projections <b>36</b> pass over apices <b>38</b> formed by the flanks <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> of the sawteeth <b>22</b> and engage behind the apices <b>38</b>. Thus, accidental loosening of the bayonet locking of socket part <b>11</b> and socket part <b>10</b> is prevented. In order to unlock, socket part <b>11</b> is moved opposite socket part <b>10</b> in a rotational loosening sense E (unlocking direction) by about 30&#xb0; and then pulled out of the outer socket part.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> again show views of the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b>. A comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that here the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b> of a key pair <b>1</b> are shown. The central plug <b>29</b> is very small since here its recess extends over 360&#xb0;. For technical manufacturing reasons and since this characterizes the lowest illuminating wattage, the lamp that can be safely used into this socket <b>10</b> does not even need the plug <b>29</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An alternative key for coding to usable lamp types will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. As mentioned above excessive wattages can result in heat damage in a light fixture or in the surroundings the light fixture as can also lamp types that are incompatible with the light fixture. Both keys can be used in combination on the lamp base <b>11</b> and the socket <b>10</b>, as in the illustrated embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. However, it is perfectly conceivable that predetermined lamp types are also prevented from being used in predetermined light fixtures via the subsequently described key system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Key projections <b>39</b> formed on the socket on the inner surface of the collar <b>12</b> and projecting toward the hole center Z serve as key elements. An inner surface <b>40</b> of the inner part cylindrical projection <b>27</b> is formed with key recesses <b>41</b>, also termed key windows, corresponding to the projections <b>39</b>. The lamp base <b>11</b> can only be inserted into the socket <b>10</b> when the number and orientation of the key recesses <b>41</b> of the lamp base <b>11</b> correspond at least to the key projections <b>39</b> of the socket <b>10</b>. The lamp types admissible for a socket can be characterized by the key protections <b>39</b>. The key recesses <b>41</b> formed on the lamp base <b>11</b> also characterize a lamp type. With this key system light fixtures can be provided with sockets <b>10</b> that only allow use of a predetermined lamp type or of a group of lamp types compatible with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> schematically show the cooperation of the lamp keys <b>31</b> and socket keys <b>26</b> in two examples. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are schematic sectional views parallel to the socket floor <b>14</b> through the socket <b>10</b> with the inserted lamp base <b>11</b>, only the area of the central hole <b>17</b> with the central plug <b>29</b> fitting in it being shown.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the lamp key <b>31</b> and the socket key <b>26</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This corresponds to the key pair <b>7</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The lug <b>25</b> is shown in dotted lines and hatched. The lamp base <b>11</b> is inserted into the socket <b>10</b> in the position of dotted-line lug <b>25</b> at the cutout <b>30</b>. Then lamp base <b>11</b> is turned in the rotational sense V so that the lug <b>25</b> is now in the hatched position. The lamp base <b>11</b> is locked in the socket <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the socket <b>10</b> with all conceivable key lugs <b>25</b> (identified at <b>2</b> to <b>7</b> corresponding to key pairs <b>2</b> to <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), in which a key plug <b>29</b> of the key pair <b>2</b> is inserted. Again, the lug <b>25</b> of the key pair <b>2</b> is shown in dotted lines in the starting position. The hatched view of the key lug <b>2</b> corresponds to the locked position. To this end the key plug <b>29</b> of the lamp base <b>11</b> has been turned relative to the socket <b>10</b> in the rotational sense V (retaining direction).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> shows that a key plug <b>29</b> of key size <b>7</b> can not fit into a socket that has a key lug <b>25</b> of sizes <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>. This is ensured by the previously described particular nature of retaining formations <b>15</b> and retaining formations <b>19</b> that ensure that the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b> can be fitted together only in a one relative angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a concrete embodiment of the invention the lamp key <b>31</b> and the socket key <b>26</b> are designed in such a manner that there is a total of seven key pairs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. There is therefore the possibility of associating a key pair with each of seven different lamp wattage ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b> of the particular key pairs always in a typical alignment and in the end position of the socket. This can be readily recognized from the particular triangular symbol <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It must be imagined for the interfitting of the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b> that the lamp base <b>11</b> of each key pair is fitted into the socket <b>10</b> by counterclockwise pivoting relative to the view plane.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The pairings of socket <b>10</b> and lamp base <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> form the keys in accordance with the following principle. The lamp bases <b>11</b> for lamps with a lower lamp wattage have larger outwardly open cutouts <b>30</b> on the particular lamp key <b>31</b> compared to lamp bases <b>11</b> for lamps with a higher lamp wattage. The outwardly open cutout is widened by 45&#xb0; per stepped lamp-wattage range starting from the highest lamp wattage range. The widening of the outwardly open cutout <b>30</b> is effected in rotational sense V, relative to the lamp base <b>11</b> inserted in the socket <b>10</b>. The widening of the outwardly open cutout <b>30</b> can be increased until the lamp key <b>31</b> of key pair <b>1</b> has a 360&#xb0; outwardly open cutout, leaving only the center of the plug <b>29</b> standing as a rudimentary lamp key <b>31</b>. Since the lamp of the lamp base <b>11</b> of the key pair <b>1</b> has the lowest lamp wattage, it can be inserted into every lamp base. Therefore, even the rudimentary lamp key <b>31</b> of the key pair <b>1</b> can be eliminated so that the lamp base of the key pair <b>1</b> can also make do entirely without the lamp key <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The socket <b>10</b> has the lug <b>25</b> as socket key. This lug is present in each key pair. The plug <b>25</b> is offset, starting from the lowest lamp wattage range, by 45&#xb0; opposite to the rotational sense V, that is, in the rotational sense E, for every next-higher lamp wattage range.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In sum, the invention has two key systems between the socket <b>10</b> and the lamp base <b>11</b> available that are different but can be combined with one another and by means of which the use of the wattage or of a wattage range as well as of the type of unsuitable lamps and the consequent damage can be effectively avoided in light fixtures.</p>
