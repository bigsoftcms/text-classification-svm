<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention pertains to electrical interconnection systems and, more particularly, to systems for use in distributing electrical power within modular wall panels or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Known interior wall systems typically employ prefabricated modular units which are joined together in various configurations to divide a workspace into smaller offices or work areas. Generally, such modular wall panels are equipped with raceways. The raceways house electrical cabling and junction blocks in order to provide electrical outlets and electrical power connections to adjacent panels. The raceway of a modular wall unit may be provided with a male connector at one end and a female connector at another end, along with junction blocks. The junction blocks can incorporate electrical outlets, disposed at spaced apart positions along the raceway. Conduits can extend between the junction blocks and between the connectors in the junction blocks. This is for purposes of providing electrical interconnection between junction blocks, panels and other components. These conduits can also be connected to an initial source of external power. The conduits for connections are often referred to as &#x201c;jumpers.&#x201d; The jumpers may have a conduit with a plurality of conductors, and with one end of the conduit connected to a cable connector. The cable connector may be a universal connector adapted to electrical connect to junction blocks or the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The principles of the invention are disclosed, by way of example, in a four way jumper/half block assembly <b>300</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-21</figref>. The jumper/half block assembly <b>300</b> advantageously provides the capability of interconnecting what are typically characterized as junction half blocks or half junction blocks to conduits having electrical cables running therethrough. The electrical cables typically correspond to and carry a plurality of electrical circuits, with the circuits often having hot, neutral and ground cable or wire connections. These conduits often comprise covered or otherwise isolated wire conductors running therethrough, with the conductors being connected within a junction block to sets of blade terminals. These blade terminals then run through the junction block and are terminated within a blade terminal connector block. The blade terminal connector block can be one which presents either male or female connector terminals, so that the connector terminals are accessible and connectable to other electrical components, such as a universal cable connector or the like. In particular, the jumper/half block assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with the invention provides the capability of utilizing a half junction block while still having four way interconnections which can be extended through walls or office panels.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For purposes of describing a configuration where a junction block assembly in accordance with the invention may be utilized, the immediately following paragraphs describe a prior art electrical connection assembly which could be adapted for use within wall panels of a space divider system. The electrical interconnection assembly is shown in the prior art drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, and depict a junction block having several receptacle connectors to provide a plurality of electrical outlets on both sides of a wall panel. The block is connected by means of conduits extending from both ends of the junction block to oppositely directed connector blocks for connection to adjoining junction blocks or adjoining panels. This assembly allows electrical power to be supplied to one end of a panel and conducted to and through the junction block to other panels. Following the description of the prior art system, the jumper/half block assembly <b>300</b> and an alternative embodiment <b>400</b> in accordance with the invention will be described.</p>

Support flanges <b>130</b> are provided adjacent each of the female connectors to provide support for electrical outlet receptacles engaged with the connectors <b>126</b>. In this manner, junction block <b>120</b> is adapted to support four electrical outlet receptacles, two on each side of a wall panel to which junction block <b>120</b> is attached. The junction block assembly further comprises end connector block <b>140</b>, provided with a female connector <b>141</b>, and connected via a standard electrical conduit <b>142</b>, which may be a flexible conduit, to end <b>123</b> of junction block <b>120</b>. Similarly, connector block <b>145</b>, provided with a male connector <b>146</b> is connected via flexible conduit <b>147</b> to end <b>121</b> of junction block <b>120</b>. In a straight line connection arrangement, as depicted for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a plurality of panels are positioned adjacent each other, electrical power is transmitted between panels by connection of male connector block <b>145</b> to female connector block <b>140</b> of the adjacent junction assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Electrical power is transmitted through the junction assembly by means of electrical wires disposed in the conduits <b>142</b>, <b>147</b>, terminated on connectors <b>141</b> and <b>146</b>, respectively, and connected to receptacle connectors <b>126</b> in junction block <b>120</b>. Accordingly, electrical power is transmitted through interconnecting panels and is at the same time made available at electrical outlet receptacles in each panel. Conduit <b>147</b>, provided with the male connector block <b>145</b>, may be a fixed-length conduit and conduit <b>142</b> may be of a length such that female connector block <b>140</b> is positioned at substantially the same distance from the panel edge in each panel independent of the width of the panel. Thus, female connector block <b>140</b> will always be accessible to male connector block <b>145</b> independent of the width of the panels. To accommodate panels of different widths, conduit <b>142</b> may be an expandable flexible conduit, such as are well known in the art. In that case, connector block <b>140</b> may be provided with an inner spatial area <b>136</b>, as shown in a partially broken-away view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The inner spatial area <b>136</b> is provided for storage of excess length of electrical wiring <b>138</b> in a coiled or other configuration. The excess length of electrical wiring <b>138</b> may be withdrawn when conduit <b>142</b> is expanded to an extended length. This arrangement is similar to that disclosed in my earlier patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,403(dated Apr. 1, 1986) and entitled ELECTRICAL JUNCTION ASSEMBLY WITH ADJUSTABLE CONNECTORS.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The conduit <b>147</b> is preferably a flexible conduit which may be bent to accommodate a connection to adjacent panels which are disposed at angular positions with respect to each other, rather than in a straight line. The junction assemblies of this invention readily accommodate an arrangement in which three or more panels are disposed in an intersecting relationship, as will be discussed farther herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In such a configuration, the male connector block <b>145</b> of one of the panels may be connected to one of the female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> of a junction block assembly in an adjacent wall panel. For this purpose, the female connector <b>141</b> of connector block <b>140</b> and female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> on junction block <b>120</b> have been made identical. Similarly, the male connector <b>146</b> on connector block <b>145</b> has been made identical to the male connector of electrical outlet receptacle <b>150</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Greater detail of the receptacle <b>150</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and is described below. As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the female connectors <b>126</b> and <b>141</b> are each provided with a pair of side flanges <b>129</b> having upper and lower recessed areas <b>128</b>, for engagement with flanges <b>148</b> of a male connector to provide a locking arrangement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 129</figref>, which are made of a resilient plastic material and formed integral to the housing to which they are connected, are provided with an outwardly extending inclined end surface <b>135</b>. When surfaces <b>135</b> are engaged by flanges such as flanges <b>148</b> of connector <b>146</b> on connector block <b>145</b>, the flanges <b>129</b> will be deflected inward, allowing flanges <b>148</b> of the male connector to engage recesses <b>128</b> to provide a locking engagement of the male and the female connectors. A protuberance <b>137</b> is provided with a generally rounded edge surface <b>139</b> and acts as an entry guide as a male connector is engaged in female connector <b>126</b>. The female connectors <b>126</b>, <b>141</b> are each provided with a plurality of female connector terminals <b>125</b> and a key lug <b>127</b>. Male connector <b>146</b> is provided with a plurality of male connector terminals <b>149</b> and an opening <b>143</b> for receiving key lug <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electrical outlet receptacle <b>150</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is provided with male connectors <b>151</b> at both ends, allowing the receptacle to be plugged into any one of the four female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> of junction block <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, junction block <b>120</b> is provided with upper and lower support flanges <b>130</b> to support receptacles <b>150</b> in each of the four female connectors <b>126</b>. The lower support flanges <b>130</b> are provided with a locking flange <b>132</b>. The receptacle <b>150</b> is provided with a spring latch <b>152</b> disposed in recess <b>154</b> in the surface <b>156</b> of receptacle <b>150</b>. Surface <b>156</b> engages one of the lower support flanges <b>130</b> when the receptacle <b>150</b> is installed in the junction block <b>120</b>. The locking flanges <b>132</b> will be aligned with the recess <b>154</b> when the receptacle <b>150</b> is inserted between flanges <b>130</b>, causing the spring latch <b>152</b> to be depressed. The receptacle <b>150</b> may then be moved to either the left or to the right to engage one of the female connectors <b>126</b>. Recesses <b>158</b> are provided in receptacle <b>150</b> to accommodate locking flange <b>132</b> and movement to either the left or to the right by a sufficient distance will cause the spring latch <b>152</b> to be moved past locking flange <b>132</b>, causing the spring latch <b>152</b> to return to its extended position. Hence, receptacle <b>150</b> will be retained in a locked position. The receptacle may be removed by depressing spring latch <b>152</b> and sliding the receptacle <b>150</b> to either left or right to align the locking flange <b>132</b> with recess <b>154</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a right-hand elevation of receptacle <b>150</b> showing a right-hand elevation or receptacle <b>150</b> showing right-hand male connector <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of junction block <b>120</b> taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows two of the four receptacle connectors <b>126</b> of connector block <b>120</b>. One of the two connectors <b>126</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is disposed on each side of the central housing section <b>131</b>, which contains a plurality of wires <b>133</b>. An eight-wire system is shown in this illustrative embodiment. Each of the male and female connectors are provided with eight separate terminals, and eight separate electrical wires <b>133</b> extend through the connector blocks <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>, the conduits <b>142</b>, <b>147</b> and the central section <b>131</b> of the junction block <b>120</b>. By way of example, these may include two ground terminal wires, three neutral wires and three positive wires representing three separate circuits, with a shared ground for two of the circuits. Similarly, 10- or 12-wire systems may be readily accommodated, having corresponding number of terminals on each of the connectors and providing a greater number of separate circuits. The four female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> are each connected to the wires <b>133</b> by means of a plurality of contact blades, described later herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Each wire, together with the connector block terminals and receptacle connector terminals to which it is connected, is referred to herein as a circuit element. A particular circuit may be selected for use by one of the receptacles <b>150</b> by appropriate wiring connections internal to the receptacle. Since all of the circuits are connected to each one of the receptacle connectors <b>126</b> of junction block <b>120</b>, a connector block <b>145</b> of an adjacent panel, equipped with a male connector, may be connected to any one of the receptacle connectors <b>126</b>. In this manner, electrical power may be provided to receptacle connectors to junction block <b>120</b> and to associated connector blocks <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> and hence to any adjacent panels to which these connectors may be connected. Similarly, a connector block <b>145</b> equipped with a male connector connected to one of the female connectors <b>126</b> may receive electrical power for distribution to a panel to which the connector block <b>145</b> belongs. Such interconnecting arrangements are described further herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a fragmentary cross-sectional view along line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a contact blade structure <b>170</b> which is one of eight such blades disposed in central housing section <b>131</b>. Each such blade is in electrical contact with one of the conductors <b>133</b>. Connection to conductor <b>133</b> is made by means of a crimped connection of blade extension member <b>172</b> to conductor <b>133</b>. As may be more readily seen from the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the extension member <b>172</b> is part of a center section <b>173</b> which is connected to left-hand upper and lower contact blades <b>174</b> and right-hand upper and lower contact blades <b>175</b>. The upper and lower contact blades on each side from the female opening part of the conductor <b>126</b> for engagement with blades of a male connector.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a fragmentary plan view of raceway areas of four wall panels illustrating the connections of interconnection assemblies of the invention in a configuration in which the four panels are disposed at right angles to each other. As will be apparent from the following description, the specific angle at which the panels are positioned is not particularly significant. Furthermore, the invention is equally applicable to a three-panel configuration or a five-panel configuration disposed at right angles to each other. Each of the four panels is provided with an interconnection assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, comprising a junction block <b>120</b>, a male connector block <b>145</b>, and a female connector block <b>140</b> attached to the junction block <b>120</b> by means of flexible conduits <b>147</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. The junction block <b>120</b> is disposed within each panel raceway near one edge of the panel. Panels <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> are positioned such that the end at which these panels are joined to other panels is the end near which the junction block <b>120</b> is positioned. One of the panels, panel <b>203</b>, is positioned with an opposite orientation in which the end near which the junction block <b>120</b> is located is positioned opposite the point of junction of the four panels. The flexible conduit <b>147</b>, provided with the male connector block <b>145</b>, extends beyond the end of the panel in which it is positioned, and the flexible conduit <b>142</b>, provided with a female connector block <b>140</b>, is terminated just short of the end of the panel. Thus, as is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a connection is made between panels by extending the flexible conduit <b>147</b> with male connector block <b>145</b> into the raceway area of the adjacent panel to engage the female connector block <b>140</b> at the end of flexible conduit <b>142</b>. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the male connector block <b>145</b> of panel <b>202</b> and its associated flexible conduit <b>147</b> extend into the raceway area of panel <b>202</b> to engage female connector block <b>140</b> of panel <b>203</b>. It will be apparent that the connection as shown between panel <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may be made whenever these panels are adjacent and independent of the angle at which the panels are disposed with respect to each other. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the flexible conduit <b>147</b>, with its male connector block <b>145</b>, associated with the panel <b>200</b> are extended into the raceway area of panel <b>202</b> for engagement with one of the female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> ofjunction block <b>120</b> in panel <b>202</b>. In this manner, an electrical connection is established among the junction blocks of the three panels <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, and <b>203</b>. Thus, electrical power provided from an external source to any one of these three may be distributed to the other two by means of the connection arrangement shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, flexible conduit <b>147</b> and its male connector block <b>145</b> of panel <b>202</b> is connected to one of the female connectors <b>126</b> of junction block <b>120</b> of panel <b>200</b> thereby establishing an electrical connection between panels <b>200</b> and <b>201</b>. This connection, in combination with the other connections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and described in the previous sentences, completes an arrangement for establishing an electrical connection from any one of four panels to the entire four-panel configuration. Additional connections may be envisioned by connections of male connectors <b>145</b> from other panels into additional ones of the female receptacle connectors <b>126</b> of the junction blocks <b>120</b> of any of the panels <b>201</b> through <b>203</b>, should one choose to provide an arrangement of more than four intersecting panels. Furthermore, additional conduits, such as conduit <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, may be connected by means of a male connector to any of the receptacle connectors <b>126</b> to provide electrical power to lamps or other fixtures. As can be seen, a great deal of flexibility has been achieved by the electrical junction assembly. The connection assembly disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs is described in my U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,159, issued Dec. 15, 1992 and titled ELECTRICAL CONNECTION ASSEMBLY.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now specifically to the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a perspective, exploded view of a jumper assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with the invention. The jumper assembly <b>300</b> is adapted for use with what can be characterized as a half junction block, or otherwise any type of junction block where there may be a &#x201c;center connect&#x201d; to external cabling. The jumper assembly <b>300</b> includes a pair of conduits comprising a first conduit <b>302</b> and a second conduit <b>304</b>. A first plurality of wire conductors <b>306</b> extends through the first conduit <b>302</b>. Correspondingly a second plurality of wire conductors <b>308</b> extends through the second conduit <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The wire conductors <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> are each electrically and structurally connected to a terminal set which can be characterized as a half H-shaped terminal set <b>310</b>. The terminal set <b>310</b> includes a series of first terminal blades <b>312</b> and second terminal blades <b>314</b>. The terminal blades <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> are each commonly integral with an elongated common blade <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The ends of the common blade <b>316</b> extend into an end connector <b>318</b>. The common blades <b>316</b> are &#x201c;locked&#x201d; into the end connector <b>318</b> by means of an insert <b>320</b>. The end connector <b>318</b> provides for accessibility of external cabling to the common blade set <b>316</b>. This configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To complete the assembly, the jumper <b>300</b> includes a pair of cover plates, comprising a first cover plate <b>322</b> and a second cover plate <b>324</b>. The cover plates can be connected together in any suitable manner (such as with screws, adhesives or the like) so as to enclose the terminal set <b>310</b> and part of the end connector <b>318</b>. This fully assembled configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an alternative configuration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of a jumper assembly <b>400</b> in accordance with the invention. As with the first jumper assembly <b>300</b>, the jumper assembly <b>400</b> includes a first conduit <b>402</b> and a second conduit <b>404</b>. A first plurality of wire conductors <b>406</b> extend through the first conduit <b>402</b>. Correspondingly, a second plurality of wire conductors <b>408</b> extends through the second conduit <b>404</b>. The ends of the conductors <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> are electrically connected to a terminal set <b>410</b>. Specifically, one of each of the conductors <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> is connected to one elongated blade <b>416</b> of the terminal set <b>410</b>. It will be appreciated that, unlike the jumper assembly <b>300</b>, the terminal set <b>410</b> of the jumper assembly <b>400</b> includes only a single elongated blade <b>416</b>, rather than a pair of terminal blades, such as the blades <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> associated with jumper assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also like the jumper assembly <b>300</b>, the jumper assembly <b>400</b> includes an end connector <b>418</b>. The terminal ends of the elongated blades <b>416</b> are appropriately inserted into the end connector <b>418</b>, so that the ends of the elongated blades are electrically accessible to external electrical components. An insert <b>420</b> is provided to &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the blades <b>416</b> within the end connector <b>418</b>. To complete the assembly, the terminal set <b>410</b> is enclosed with a first cover <b>422</b> which is coupled to a second opposing cover <b>424</b>. As apparent from the jumper assembly <b>300</b> and jumper assembly <b>400</b>, the first and second conduits <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are aligned so that one is immediately above the other.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the jumper assembly <b>300</b>, with the opposing ends of each of the first and second conduits <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, respectively, electrically coupled to a pair of ganged cable connectors <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>. The cable connectors <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> can be conventional in design and are adapted to provide for connection of the wire conductors <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> to external electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates the jumper assembly <b>300</b> in a configuration with the cable connectors <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> which is different than the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Specifically, in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the cable connectors <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> are not ganged, but instead are directed in opposing directions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a further configuration utilizing a pair of jumper assemblies <b>300</b>. Each of the jumper assemblies <b>300</b> of the pair is connected as previously described herein to a first conduit <b>302</b> and a second conduit <b>304</b>. However, in this particular configuration, one of the jumper assemblies <b>300</b> is connected to one first conduit <b>302</b>, while the other jumper assembly <b>300</b> is connected to a different first conduit <b>302</b>. However, both of the jumper assemblies <b>300</b> of the pair are each connected to opposing ends of the second conduit <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the configuration of the jumper assembly <b>300</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> further shows this particular configuration as it may be installed within a series of walls or panels. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the jumper assembly <b>300</b> as installed within a first wall or panel <b>330</b>. The first and second conduits <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> each extend from the jumper assembly <b>300</b> are directed in opposing directions within a second wall or panel <b>332</b> and a third wall or panel <b>334</b>. Still further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a &#x201c;four way&#x201d; interconnection with a pair of jumper assemblies <b>300</b>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates the jumper assembly configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. However, the pair of jumper assemblies <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> as providing electrical interconnections within a set of four intersecting walls or panels. Specifically, the jumper assemblies <b>300</b> are located within the second wall or panel <b>332</b> and third wall or panel <b>334</b>. The first cable connector <b>326</b> is located within the first wall or panel <b>330</b>, while the second cable connector <b>328</b> is located within the fourth wall or panel <b>336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with the foregoing, a four way jumper assembly is provided, and can be particularly adapted for use with half block assemblies.</p>
