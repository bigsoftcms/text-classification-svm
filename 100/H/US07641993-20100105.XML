<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a system and method for controlling the concentration of hydrogen being bled from an anode exhaust gas flow and, more particularly, to a system and method for controlling the concentration of hydrogen being bled from an anode exhaust gas flow by controlling the differential pressure between the cathode side and the anode side of a fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. The protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load to perform work before being sent to the cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer electrolyte proton conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane. The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs are relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions for effective operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack to generate the desired power. For example, a typical fuel cell stack for a vehicle may have two hundred or more stacked fuel cells. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode input reactant gas, typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-product. The fuel cell stack also receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that flows into the anode side of the stack. The stack also includes flow channels through which a cooling fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fuel cell stack includes a series of bipolar plates positioned between the several MEAs in the stack, where the bipolar plates and the MEAs are positioned between two end plates. The bipolar plates include an anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the stack. Anode gas flow channels are provided on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the anode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. Cathode gas flow channels are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. One end plate includes anode gas flow channels, and the other end plate includes cathode gas flow channels. The bipolar plates and end plates are made of a conductive material, such as stainless steel or a conductive composite. The end plates conduct the electricity generated by the fuel cells out of the stack. The bipolar plates also include flow channels through which a cooling fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For automotive applications, it typically takes about 400 fuel cells to provide the desired power. Because so many fuel cells are required for the stack in automotive fuel cell system designs, the stack is sometimes split into two sub-stacks each including about 200 fuel cells because it is difficult to effectively provide an equal flow of hydrogen gas through so many fuel cells in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been proposed in the art to provide stack order switching or flow shifting in a fuel cell system that employs split stacks. Particularly, suitable valves and plumbing in the system are provided so that the anode exhaust gas exiting a first sub-stack is sent to the anode input of a second sub-stack, and the anode exhaust gas exiting the second sub-stack is sent to the anode input of the first sub-stack in a cyclical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is desirable that the distribution of hydrogen within the anode flow channels in the fuel cell stack be substantially constant for proper fuel cell stack operation. Therefore, it is known in the art to input more hydrogen into the fuel cell stack than is necessary for a certain output load of the stack so that the anode gas evenly distributed. However, because of this requirement, the amount of hydrogen in the anode exhaust gas is significant, and would lead to low system efficiency if that hydrogen were discarded. Therefore, it is known in the art to recirculate the anode exhaust gas back to the anode input to reuse the discarded hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The MEAs are porous and thus allow nitrogen in the air from the cathode side of the stack to permeate therethrough and collect in the anode side of the stack, referred to in the industry as nitrogen cross-over. Nitrogen in the anode side of the fuel cell stack dilutes the hydrogen such that if the nitrogen concentration increases beyond a certain percentage, such as 50%, the fuel cell stack becomes unstable and may fail. It is known in the art to provide a bleed valve at the anode gas output of the fuel cell stack to remove nitrogen from the anode side of the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The recirculation gas that is periodically bled from the anode recirculation loop typically includes a considerable amount of hydrogen. It is known in the art to direct the bled recirculation gas to a combustor to burn most or all of the hydrogen therein before the recirculation gas is exhausted to the environment. However, the combustor adds a significant cost, weight and complexity to the fuel cell system, which is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also known in the art to eliminate the combustor and directly mix the recirculation gas with the cathode exhaust gas. If the recirculation gas is directly mixed with the cathode exhaust gas without control, the amount of hydrogen in the recirculation gas is unknown. A hydrogen concentration sensor can be provided in the cathode exhaust gas line after the mixing point with the recirculation gas to detect the concentration of hydrogen. The hydrogen concentration sensor would provide a signal to the controller during the bleed indicative of the concentration of hydrogen in the mixed exhaust gas. If the concentration of hydrogen was to high, the controller would increase the speed of the compressor to provide more cathode exhaust air to lower the concentration of hydrogen. If the compressor was unable to effectively keep the concentration of hydrogen below the safe limit for the stack load, then the controller would have to close the bleed valve. However, the hydrogen sensor would have to be inexpensive and be able to within stand the humidity of the exhaust gas. Currently, known hydrogen concentration sensors are unable to provide these requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a system and method for limiting the amount of hydrogen being bled from an anode exhaust gas flow in a fuel cell system is disclosed. The method includes maintaining a pressure bias between an anode outlet and a cathode outlet of the fuel cell stack so that when an anode exhaust gas is bled and mixed with the cathode exhaust gas, the concentration of hydrogen in the mixed gas is maintained below a predetermined percentage. The pressure bias is such that the anode exhaust gas has a higher gas pressure than the cathode exhaust gas. During system start-up, cathode inlet air by-passes the stack to be mixed directly with the mixed cathode exhaust and anode exhaust. The method sets a slew rate limit on the pressure bias during up power transients on the stack so that any delay between providing cathode air to the stack and hydrogen reactant gas to the stack is reduced. The method also sometimes prevents a hydrogen exhaust gas bleed during a down power transient.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a method for controlling the amount of hydrogen being bled from an exhaust gas flow in a fuel cell system is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses. For example, the discussion below describes a method for controlling the amount of hydrogen being bled from an exhaust gas flow from an anode recirculation loop. However, the method for controlling the amount of hydrogen being bled from an exhaust gas flow of the invention has application for other fuel cell systems, such as those employing split stacks and anode flow shifting.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of a fuel cell system <b>10</b> including a fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. Hydrogen gas from a hydrogen source <b>14</b> is provided to a mixing junction <b>16</b> and then sent to the anode side of the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> on line <b>18</b>. An anode exhaust gas is output from the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> on line <b>20</b> and is sent to a bleed valve <b>26</b>. A recirculation pump (not shown) pumps the anode exhaust gas through the valve <b>26</b> to the mixing junction <b>16</b> to be mixed with fresh hydrogen from the source <b>14</b> to provide an anode recirculation loop. The proper mixture of the fresh hydrogen from the source <b>14</b> and the recirculated anode exhaust gas at the mixing junction <b>16</b> sets the pressure of the anode side of the stack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The fuel cell system <b>10</b> also includes a compressor <b>30</b> that provides cathode air on line <b>32</b> to the cathode side of the fuel cell stack <b>12</b>. The cathode exhaust gas from the stack <b>12</b> is output from the stack <b>12</b> on cathode exhaust gas line <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As discussed above, nitrogen cross-over from the cathode side of the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> dilutes the hydrogen in the anode side that affects stack performance. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically bleed the anode exhaust gas to reduce the amount of nitrogen being recirculated. During the nitrogen bleed, the valve <b>26</b> is controlled to switch the anode exhaust gas from the recirculation loop to an exhaust line <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, the bled recirculation gas in the line <b>28</b> is mixed with the cathode exhaust gas on line <b>34</b> in a mixing junction <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system <b>10</b> also includes a line <b>40</b> coupled to the cathode input line <b>32</b> and the mixing junction <b>36</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, during certain times of the operation of the fuel cell system <b>10</b> it may be desirable to by-pass the fuel cell stack <b>12</b> with some of the cathode input air by controlling a by-pass valve <b>42</b> so that there is more air in the cathode exhaust gas to reduce the concentration of hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention proposes a method for controlling the hydrogen emissions in the exhaust of the fuel cell system <b>10</b>. In certain fuel cell systems designs, it is desirable to maintain the percentage of hydrogen in the mixed anode and cathode exhaust gas to be less than 2% by volume, between 2% and 4% by volume for only a few seconds, and never more than 4% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A fuel cell system basically has four modes of operation. Particularly, the fuel cell system has a start-up mode, a steady state operation mode, power transient operation modes and a shut-down mode. According to the invention, the concentration of hydrogen in the mixed cathode/anode exhaust gas during an anode bleed is limited by limiting the amount of hydrogen being emitted from the recirculation loop. The present invention proposes limiting the amount of hydrogen in the mixed cathode and anode exhaust by providing a pressure differential between the cathode side of the stack <b>12</b> and the anode side of the stack <b>12</b> where the anode side has a higher pressure than the cathode side within a preset range.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the invention, the pressure differential between the anode side and the cathode side of the stack <b>12</b> has an upper boundary and a lower boundary depending on various factors. For example, the anode side pressure should be at least 10 kPa higher than the cathode side pressure to prevent the cathode exhaust gas from flowing into the anode side of the stack as a result of sensor inaccuracies, flow shifting effects, etc. However, the pressure bias should be as high as possible at all times so that the maximum anode exhaust gas flow rate allowed occurs during a bleed. A higher flow rate is important to remove as much water and nitrogen as possible from the anode flow channels during the bleed. The value of 10 kPa at low stack current densities will cause a low enough concentration of hydrogen in the mixed exhaust gas even though the amount of air in the exhaust gas is low. At high current densities, the pressure bias can be about 35 kPa to provide sufficient flow to remove water without an increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the mixed exhaust gas because of the greater amount of air.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At system start-up, air is in the anode flow channels from the previous shut-down and hydrogen is injected into the anode flow channels. The hydrogen/air front should move through the anode side of the stack <b>12</b> as quickly as possible, as is well understood in the art, for various reasons, such as a quicker, more reliable start. To provide this quick start, a significant amount of hydrogen must flow through the anode side of the stack <b>12</b> to displace the air creating a potential problem with excessive hydrogen being exhausted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the invention, a specialized control algorithm within the controller <b>48</b> is used to reduce the hydrogen emissions during start-up. Particularly, the compressor <b>30</b> is started before the hydrogen flow and the valve <b>42</b> is opened so that air in the line <b>40</b> is sent to the mixing junction <b>36</b>. Soon thereafter, the hydrogen injectors (not shown) begin injecting hydrogen into the anode side of the stack <b>12</b> and out of the bleed valve <b>26</b>. The cathode air that by-passes the stack <b>12</b> dilutes this initial slug of hydrogen that displaces the air present within the anode flow channels so that the hydrogen emissions is maintained below 2% by volume. After some predetermined period of time, the valve <b>42</b> is closed, and all of the air from the compressor <b>30</b> is directed through the cathode side of the stack <b>12</b> consistent with the load on the stack <b>12</b>. Further, the bleed valve <b>26</b> is closed. During this time, there are no more hydrogen emissions and the fuel cell reaction causes the cell voltages to reach an open circuit voltage. At some time after this point, the system <b>10</b> transitions into a normal run mode and power is allowed to be drawn from the stack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the steady state operation, a &#x201c;pressure bias&#x201d; is maintained between the recirculation gas from the bleed valve <b>26</b> during the bleed and the cathode exhaust gas on the line <b>34</b>, where the recirculation gas pressure at the bleed valve <b>26</b> is higher than the cathode exhaust gas pressure on the line <b>34</b>. This pressure differential between the cathode side and the anode side of the fuel cell system <b>10</b> maintains the concentration of hydrogen in the mixed cathode and anode exhaust gas to be below 2%.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system <b>10</b> is calibrated so that for a given cathode reactant gas flow/cathode stoichiometry, as a function of current density, a desriable pressure bias between the cathode side and the anode side will be provided. In other words, if the steady state cathode stoichiometry at 0.2 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>is 3.0, there will be a corresponding calibrated pressure bias of, for example, 25 kPa higher at the anode side of the stack <b>12</b> that will result in a slightly less than 2% mixed air/hydrogen exhaust concentration, even if the anode hydrogen concentration is 100%. Thus, even if the bleed valve <b>26</b> is constantly opened, the steady state exhaust concentration will never exceed 2%. A pressure bias table can be provided for steady state operation where a desired pressure differential between the cathode and anode sides of the stack <b>12</b> is maintained regardless of the load on the stack <b>12</b>. Typically, the pressure bias values will be the smallest near idle, for example 10 kPa, and the highest at high power, for example 35 kPa, for differing levels of hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pressure bias table discussed above may not prevent excessive hydrogen exhaust emissions during an up power transient because a higher pressure bias can increase the hydrogen exhaust concentration for a very short time because the hydrogen injectors respond faster than the compressor <b>30</b>. In order to address this potential problem, the present invention proposes a slew rate limit on the pressure bias set-point on up power transients. For example, from an idle power to a maximum power request from the stack <b>12</b>, the set-point would normally step from 10 kPa to 35 kPa. The higher hydrogen flow caused by this higher pressure bias is sometimes not diluted sufficiently until the compressor <b>30</b> gets to the desired cathode set-point for maximum power. If the rise rate of the pressure bias set-point is limited to less than the cathode flow rise rate, then the hydrogen remains sufficiently diluted through the up power transient.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If there is a quick down power transient of significant magnitude and speed, the pressure bias may not have enough time to rise significantly, and thus, the system may provide excessive hydrogen in the anode exhaust gas on the down power transient during a recirculation bleed. According to the invention, the algorithm can prevent or over-ride a bleed request during a power down transient to prevent too much hydrogen in the mixed exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The down power transient is particularly troublesome if it occurs after a high power transient or after the stack <b>12</b> has been running at high power for a long period of time. If the system <b>10</b> is at maximum or high power, there is a lot of hydrogen flow through the anode channels, most of which is consumed by the reaction. As soon as a down power transient occurs, there is all of a sudden a lot of hydrogen present and no place to consume it in the stack <b>12</b>. Fortunately, there is also no need to bleed any anode exhaust through the bleed valve <b>26</b> into the cathode exhaust for some short period of time during these down power transients. Therefore, the present invention over-rides any bleed request when a down power transient is detected, and maintains the bleed valve <b>26</b> closed for a short period of time. After this period of time has passed, the over-ride will end and normal bleed operation can resume. This will prevent excessive hydrogen concentration in the cathode exhaust mixture during a large down power transient.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At system shut-down, it is desirable that the system <b>10</b> purge the cathode and anode flow channels in the stack <b>12</b> to remove as much water as possible to prevent freezing after shut-down and to prevent cell flooding on a subsequent restart at colder temperatures. During this shut-down purge, there is more than enough cathode air being exhausted on line <b>34</b> to dilute the majority of the hydrogen present in the system <b>10</b> at shut-down.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, in some fuel cell system designs, the compressor <b>30</b> is a turbo compressor to provide a large volume of airflow for high power demands. During those times when the power request is low, the compressor <b>30</b> would have a difficult time maintaining a steady low flow rate. Therefore, some of the cathode flow may be diverted around the stack <b>12</b> through the valve <b>42</b> so that the compressor <b>30</b> can run faster than what is necessary for the system power demand.</p>
