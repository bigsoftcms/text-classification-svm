<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Application No. 200192 filed in Japan on Jun. 29, 2001, the content of which is incorporated hereinto by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a method of battery pack manufacture, and in particular to a battery pack and its method of manufacture wherein batteries and output terminals are inserted into a mold in a process step to form an external plastic case.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A battery pack formed by inserting batteries into a molded plastic resin region, which serves as the external battery pack case, has been developed. This type of battery pack is cited in Japanese Non-examined Patent Publication 2000-315483. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printed circuit board <b>105</b> and batteries <b>102</b> are inserted and fixed in the mold when a molded plastic resin region is formed and becomes the external case of the battery pack. Unlike related art battery packs, this battery pack does not require battery and printed circuit board insertion and assembly in a separately formed case. Here, the printed circuit board and batteries are held in fixed positions during the molding step to form the molded plastic resin region which becomes the case. This type of battery pack can be manufactured inexpensively in quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when the battery pack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is actually manufactured in quantity, it has the drawback of poor yield. This is because the molded plastic resin region is difficult to form in a precise configuration. In particular, an error in the printed circuit board <b>105</b> dimensions makes molding difficult for a battery pack in which the printed circuit board <b>105</b> is inserted into the molded plastic resin region. The printed circuit board <b>105</b> is inserted and temporarily held in the mold cavity <b>111</b> for molding in the plastic resin region. However, a printed circuit board <b>105</b> with error in its dimensions cannot be temporarily held in a precise position in the mold <b>110</b>. This is because the printed circuit board <b>105</b> is slid into, or sandwiched in the mold to temporarily hold it in a fixed position in the mold cavity <b>111</b>. The mold <b>110</b> is designed to allow a printed circuit board <b>105</b> with maximum dimensions to be slid or sandwiched in the mold cavity <b>111</b> and temporarily held. Consequently, a printed circuit board smaller than maximum dimensions cannot be temporarily held in the proper position, and it also cannot be reliably retained in that position. A printed circuit board which cannot be reliably retained in the mold cavity can easily become further out of position when molten plastic resin is injected into the mold cavity. Therefore, this battery pack has the drawback that the inserted printed circuit board moves out of position. In a battery pack having output terminals attached to a printed circuit board, and having those output terminals exposed outside the molded plastic resin region, there is a further drawback of plastic resin attaching to the surfaces of the output terminals. The cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a mold for forming a plastic resin region that exposes the output terminals outside of the molded plastic resin region. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is necessary to tightly contact the mold <b>210</b> to the output terminals <b>203</b> at the exposed areas. If space is left here, plastic resin can ingress into the gap left between the mold <b>210</b> and the output terminals <b>203</b> as shown by the broken lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This will cover the output terminals <b>203</b> with plastic resin. In particular, high manufacturing efficiency injection molding injects molten synthetic resin into the mold cavity <b>211</b> at extremely high pressures. Therefore, molten plastic resin can ingress into even small gaps and reduce yield. A battery pack with plastic resin on its output terminals does not allow electrical connection of the output terminals to power supply terminals of an electrical apparatus and is a reject part.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a connector <b>116</b> provided with output terminals at the end of lead wires <b>115</b> is attached to a battery pack having parts such as a printed circuit board which cannot be accurately positioned in the mold. In a battery pack of this configuration, output terminals are not embedded within the molded plastic resin region, and yield can be improved. However, not only does the attachment of lead wires <b>115</b> make fabrication more complex, temporary placement within the mold <b>110</b> is also troublesome. This is because battery pack parts are temporarily placed in the mold cavity <b>111</b> with lead wires <b>115</b> pulled outside the mold <b>110</b>. Furthermore, this battery pack has the drawback that lead wires can be easily open circuited. In addition, electrical equipment which attaches a battery pack having lead wires must provide internal the necessary space to accommodate the lead wires and connector. Therefore, it also has the drawback that space for holding the battery pack becomes greater.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention was developed to eliminate drawbacks of the type mentioned above. Thus it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a battery pack and its method of manufacture wherein output terminals can be inserted in a mold and accurately positioned within the plastic resin mold region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The battery pack of the present invention is provided with a battery, output terminals to bring out the electrodes of the battery, and a molding holder to mate with the battery and retain the output terminals. In this battery pack, at least the battery, the molding holder, and its connecting region are inserted into a molded plastic resin region. The molded plastic resin region exposes the output terminal surfaces, and also joins the battery, output terminals, and molding holder as a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, output terminals are fixed to a printed circuit board of the battery pack of the present invention, and the molding holder is disposed between this printed circuit board and the battery. The printed circuit board can be disposed parallel to the end plane of the battery. The printed circuit board is connected to positive and negative battery electrodes via lead plates. In this battery pack, the molding holder is sandwiched and held between the printed circuit board and battery, and the printed circuit board, molding holder, and end region of the battery are inserted and molded into the plastic resin region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The molded plastic resin region preferably comprises end cover segments disposed to enclose both ends of the battery, and connection segments to join the end cover segments at both ends of the battery. Connection segments can be positioned along the corner regions of edges of the external battery case. Further, corner regions of edges of the external battery case can be beveled, and connection segments can be positioned along these beveled-edge corner regions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method of manufacture of the present invention fabricates a battery pack provided with a battery, output terminals to bring out the electrodes of the battery, and a molding holder to mate with the battery and retain the output terminals. In this method of manufacture, the molding holder, output terminals, and battery are temporarily retained in a mold, and synthetic resin in the molten state is injected into the mold cavity. Further, in this method of manufacture, at least the connecting region of the battery and molding holder are inserted into the plastic resin region formed by the mold. In addition, the molded plastic resin region is formed to expose the output terminal surfaces from the plastic resin, and to join the battery, output terminals, and molding holder as a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the method of manufacture of the present invention, output terminals can be fixed to a printed circuit board, the molding holder can be disposed between this printed circuit board and the battery, and this assembly can be inserted and molded into the plastic resin region. The printed circuit board can be disposed parallel to the end plane of the battery, and it can be connected to positive and negative battery electrodes via lead plates. The molding holder is sandwiched between the printed circuit board and battery and temporarily retained in the mold, molten synthetic resin is injected into the mold cavity, and the printed circuit board, molding holder, and end region of the battery are embedded in the molded plastic resin region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in the method of manufacture of the present invention, the plastic resin region can be formed by the mold with end cover segments disposed to enclose both ends of the battery, and with connection segments to join the end cover segments at both ends of the battery. Preferably, the molded plastic resin region is formed with connection segments positioned along the corner regions of edges of the external battery case. In this molded plastic resin region, a battery having an external case with beveled-edge corner regions can be temporarily held in the mold cavity, and connection segments can be formed along the beveled-edge corner regions of the external battery case.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The battery pack and its method of manufacture described above has the characteristic that output terminals can be inserted in accurate positions within the molded plastic resin region. This is because the battery pack and method of manufacture of the present invention connects output terminals to the battery via a molding holder formed separately from the molded plastic resin region, and the molded plastic resin region is formed with the molding holder, output terminals, and battery inserted in that region. The molding holder can be molded with extremely high precision compared to components such as the external battery case. Consequently, a configuration joining the output terminals to the battery via the molding holder can embed those components in the molded plastic resin region while disposing the output terminals in an accurate position with respect to the battery. In this manner, the battery pack and method of manufacture of the present invention, which allows output terminals to be inserted in accurate positions in the molded plastic resin region, can effectively prevent ingress of plastic resin between the output terminals and the mold during formation of the molded plastic resin region, and can effectively prevent output terminals surfaces from being covered with plastic allowing yield increase.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The battery packs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref> have a battery <b>32</b>, <b>52</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> inserted and fixed in a molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> show oblique views of the disassembled parts of the battery packs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. These types of perspective views show the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> separated from other parts to allow the form of the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> to be easily understood. However, since individual parts are molded into the plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> in an actual battery pack, they are not disassembled as shown in the figures. Further, for easy understanding of individual parts embedded in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>, these perspective views show the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b>, and battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> in separated arrangement. However, when assembled as a battery pack, the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> with attached output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b>, and battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> are inserted and fixed in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A battery pack, as shown in these figures, is provided with a battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, a printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> with attached output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> which connect to the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, and a molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> to hold the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> in fixed positions via the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> is a rechargeable secondary battery such as a lithium ion battery, a nickel hydrogen battery, or a nickel cadmium battery. Further, the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> is a thin outline rectangular battery, both sides of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A have curved surfaces, and four corner regions of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A are shaped with beveled-edges. If a lithium ion battery is used as the thin outline rectangular battery, it is characterized by allowing greater charge capacity per overall battery pack volume.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A battery pack of the figures is provided with a molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> to temporarily retain output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> in accurate positions in the mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b> for inclusion in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. The molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> is formed of plastic separately from the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. This molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> disposes the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> in specified positions on the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, and is inserted into the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. Since the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> of the battery packs of the figures are attached to a printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> disposes the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> in a specified position on the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. In this type of battery pack, output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> are attached to a printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, and the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> are inserted and fixed in position inside the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> via the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>. Although not illustrated, it is not always necessary to attach the output terminals to a printed circuit board in the battery pack of the present invention. In this battery pack, a molding holder is disposed between the output terminals and the battery, the output terminals, molding holder, and battery are inserted in the molded plastic resin region, and the output terminals are thereby attached in fixed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, to which the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> are attached, also has electronic parts (not illustrated) to provide battery protection circuitry mounted on its surface. The printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> of the figures is shorter than the length of the thin outline rectangular battery sealing cap <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B and is narrower than width of the sealing cap <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B. The sealing cap <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B is positioned at the end of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. Consequently, the shape of the end region of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> is the shape of the sealing cap <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B. Output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> are attached to the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> by soldering. Further, the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> is connected to positive and negative electrodes <b>32</b>C,<b>52</b>C of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> via a PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b> and lead plates <b>37</b>,<b>57</b>. The molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> is sandwiched between the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> and maintains a fixed position until the plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> is molded.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> disposes the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> in fixed positions relative to the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> via the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>. The molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> also temporarily retains the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, with attached output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b>, and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> in fixed positions within the mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b>. The molding holder <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> separates the printed circuit board <b>35</b> from one end of the battery <b>32</b>, and disposes it parallel to end of the battery <b>32</b>, which is the sealing cap <b>32</b>B. The molding holder <b>34</b> of this figure is formed in an overall rectangular cylindrical shape. The rectangular cylindrical shaped molding holder <b>34</b> has perimeter walls <b>34</b>A disposed perpendicular to the sealing cap <b>32</b>B, and supports the printed circuit board <b>35</b> parallel to the sealing cap <b>32</b>B. Further, the rectangular cylindrical molding holder <b>34</b> has a length (L) and a width (W) equal to the printed circuit board <b>35</b> outline, and has a shape that inserts inside the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b> in a buried fashion. Still further, the rectangular cylindrical molding holder <b>34</b> has a center connecting section <b>34</b>B formed as a single piece in its rectangular cylindrical center region. The center connecting section <b>34</b>B is provided with an insertion area (positioned on the backside in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to accommodate the electrode protruding from the sealing lid <b>32</b>B. This molding holder <b>34</b> can be joined to the battery <b>32</b> in a specified position by inserting the protruding electrode into the insertion area of the molding holder <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the interior of the molding holder <b>34</b> in the figures is provided with an open area <b>38</b> to accommodate in-flowing plastic with the molding holder <b>34</b> in contact with the battery <b>32</b> sealing cap <b>32</b>B. Plastic of the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b> is also injected into the interior of this molding holder <b>34</b>, which allows it to be solidly inserted in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>. However, it is not always necessary to inject plastic of the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b> into the interior of the molding holder <b>34</b>. Still further, the molding holder <b>34</b> of the figures is provided with a through-hole (not illustrated) to pass through the lead plate <b>37</b> attached to one end of the printed circuit board <b>35</b>. In this configuration of molding holder <b>34</b>, the lead plate <b>37</b> attached to the printed circuit board <b>35</b> is passed through the through-hole allowing the printed circuit board <b>35</b> to be connected in a fixed position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This configuration of molding holder <b>34</b> is sandwiched between the printed circuit board <b>35</b> and the battery <b>32</b> disposing the printed circuit board <b>35</b> in a fixed position with respect to the battery <b>32</b>. With the molding holder <b>34</b> sandwiched between the printed circuit board <b>35</b> and the battery <b>32</b>, the printed circuit board <b>35</b> is connected to the positive and negative battery <b>32</b> electrodes <b>32</b>C via the PTC device <b>36</b> and lead plates <b>37</b>. When the printed circuit board <b>35</b> is connected via the PTC device <b>36</b> and lead plates <b>37</b>, the molding holder <b>34</b> sandwiched between the printed circuit board <b>35</b> and the battery <b>32</b> is held in a fixed position. In addition, the printed circuit board <b>35</b> can also be bonded to the sandwiched molding holder <b>34</b> for even more solid attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The molding holder <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> disposes the output terminals <b>53</b> perpendicular to the end plane of the battery <b>52</b>, which is the sealing cap <b>52</b>B. This molding holder <b>54</b> is also formed in a rectangular cylindrical shape and supports the printed circuit board <b>55</b>. However, this molding holder <b>54</b> has its rectangular cylindrical shaped perimeter walls <b>54</b>A disposed parallel to the sealing cap <b>52</b>B. This molding holder <b>54</b> is shaped as two rectangular sections joined in a parallel fashion by a center connecting section <b>54</b>B. The center connecting section <b>54</b>B is positioned between the two rectangular sections and is provided with an insertion area <b>54</b>C above the center connecting section <b>54</b>B to accommodate the electrode protruding from the sealing cap <b>52</b>B. The perimeter wall <b>54</b>A of the rectangular cylindrical molding holder <b>54</b> which faces the sealing cap <b>52</b>B is increased in height to prevent the printed circuit board <b>55</b> from moving out of position. The width (W) of this molding holder <b>54</b> is determined by the height of the perimeter wall <b>54</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This molding holder <b>54</b> also disposes the printed circuit board <b>55</b> in a fixed position with respect to the battery <b>52</b>. When the printed circuit board <b>55</b> is connected to the positive and negative electrodes <b>52</b>C of the battery <b>52</b> via the PTC device <b>56</b> and lead plates <b>57</b>, the printed circuit board <b>55</b> holds the molding holder <b>54</b> in a fixed position. The molding holder <b>54</b> is inserted into the molded plastic resin region <b>51</b> and attached in a fixed position. Consequently, it is sufficient for the printed circuit board <b>55</b> to temporarily hold the molding holder <b>54</b> in a fixed position until the molded plastic resin region <b>51</b> is formed. However, the printed circuit board <b>55</b> may also be attached to the molding holder <b>54</b> by bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> are inserted into the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> at a processing step which molds synthetic plastic resin. Output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> are attached to the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>. Therefore, the output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> as well as the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> are inserted in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. The battery pack of the figures does not embed the entire battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> inside the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. The battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> is inserted in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> with its protruding electrode end plane tightly sealed in the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. This type of battery pack is characterized by allowing a smaller outline. However, the battery can also be inserted in the molded plastic resin region with one part, or the entire battery embedded in plastic to make a battery pack with a good sturdy structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> is formed overall as a single piece and is made up of end cover segments <b>31</b>A, <b>51</b>A positioned to cover both ends of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, and connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B to join a pair of end cover segments <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A. The end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A at the protruding electrode end of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, namely the sealing cap <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B end, is formed with the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and the end of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> inserted and embedded in molded plastic. The end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A at the bottom end of the external case <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B is formed to follow the outer perimeter of the bottom end plane of the battery pack in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A at the bottom end of the external case <b>32</b>B,<b>52</b>B of the battery pack in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> is formed to cover the entire surface of the end plane, namely it is formed in the shape of the bottom end plane.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B are positioned along the corner regions of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. The battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> is a thin outline rectangular battery with an external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A having beveled-edge corner regions. Connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B are disposed in the beveled-edge corner regions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the battery pack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B disposed in corner regions on the lower side (in the figures) of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the battery pack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> has connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B disposed in corner regions on the upper side of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A. The connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B are disposed in the beveled-edge corner regions of the external case <b>32</b>A,<b>52</b>A, and do not increase the size of the battery pack outline. In these figures, the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> has two connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B joining a pair of end cover segments <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A. However, it is also possible to establish connection segments along four corner regions of the external case to join a pair of end cover segments with four connection segments.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The battery packs described above are manufactured as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(1) Output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b> and protection circuit electronic components (not illustrated) are attached to the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(2) The printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> is connected to the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> via lead plates <b>37</b>,<b>57</b> and the PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b>. The PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b> is disposed between the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. The PTC device <b>36</b>,<b>56</b> and lead plates <b>37</b>,<b>57</b> are spot welded and connected at one end to the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, and are spot welded and connected at the other end to lead plates <b>37</b>,<b>57</b> attached to the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>. When the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> is connected to the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> is disposed between the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. The molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> is located between the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, and connects the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> and the battery in precise relative positions.
<br/>
By the above processing steps, the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> are connected as a unit to become a battery assembly.
<br/>
(3) After the battery assembly is set in the mold cavity, the mold is fastened together. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 12</figref>, the fastened together mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b> has gaps <b>312</b>,<b>512</b> to form the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. Heated, molten synthetic plastic resin is injected into these gaps <b>312</b>,<b>512</b> to form the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. The molten synthetic resin is injected through a plastic injection orifice <b>310</b>A,<b>510</b>A opened through the mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b>. The plastic injection orifice <b>310</b>A,<b>510</b>A is in communication with the gaps <b>312</b>,<b>512</b> in the mold cavity <b>311</b>,<b>511</b>. Further, the mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b> has alignment projections <b>313</b>,<b>513</b> to temporarily retain the battery assembly in a fixed position. The alignment projections <b>313</b>,<b>513</b> contact the surfaces of the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> or the printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b> and temporarily hold the battery assembly in a precise position.

The alignment projections <b>313</b> of these figures sandwich the molding holder <b>34</b> from above and below and prevent vertical movement out of position. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, square upper corners of the molding holder <b>34</b> contact mold <b>310</b> corner region inside surfaces to prevent lateral movement out of position. Finally, for the mold <b>310</b>, alignment projections <b>313</b> press against the surfaces of the output terminals <b>33</b>, and the bottom end of the battery <b>32</b> contacts the inside surface of the mold <b>310</b> cavity <b>311</b> to prevent lengthwise movement of the battery assembly out of position.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show cross-sectional views of the mold <b>510</b> for fabrication of the battery pack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. These and other figures show mold <b>510</b> alignment projections <b>513</b> pressing against the surfaces of the output terminals <b>53</b> to temporarily retain the printed circuit board <b>55</b> and molding holder <b>54</b> in a fixed position. For the mold <b>510</b> of these figures, alignment projections <b>513</b> press against the surfaces of the output terminals <b>53</b>, and the bottom surface of the molding holder <b>54</b> contacts the inside surface of the mold <b>510</b> cavity <b>511</b> to prevent vertical movement of the printed circuit board <b>55</b> and the molding holder <b>54</b> out of position. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, square lower corner regions of the molding holder <b>54</b> are shaped to fit along inside surfaces of mold <b>510</b> corner regions to prevent lateral movement out of position. Alignment projections <b>513</b> pressing against the upper surface of the printed circuit board <b>55</b> press against the surfaces of the output terminals <b>53</b> and expose those output terminals <b>53</b> outside the molded plastic resin region <b>51</b>. Finally, for the mold <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, projections <b>54</b>D from the front surfaces of the molding holder <b>54</b> contact the inside surface of the mold <b>510</b> cavity <b>511</b>, and mold <b>510</b> alignment projections <b>513</b> press against the bottom end of the battery <b>52</b> to prevent lengthwise movement of the battery assembly out of position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(4) Heated, molten synthetic plastic resin is injected under pressure into the mold cavity <b>311</b>,<b>511</b>. Molten synthetic resin obtains ingress to gaps <b>312</b>,<b>512</b> in the mold cavity <b>311</b>,<b>511</b> and the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> is formed. The plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> is molded as a single piece in the form of end cover segments <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A joined by connection segments <b>31</b>B,<b>51</b>B. The printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b> are inserted in, and fixed in position by the end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A at one end. The end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A, with the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> inserted and fixed in it, preferably obtains ingress to the interior of the rectangular cylindrical molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b> to solidly hold that molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>. To facilitate injection of end cover segment <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A synthetic resin into the interior of the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, open areas <b>38</b>,<b>58</b> are provided to guide molten synthetic resin inside the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>. However, it is not always necessary to cause the ingress of molten synthetic resin into the interior of the molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>. The mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref> forms end cover segments <b>31</b>A,<b>51</b>A in the same plane as both ends of the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. A battery pack fabricated by forming a molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b> with the mold <b>310</b>,<b>510</b> can be made with an overall thickness as thin as the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>. However, the mold can also form a molded plastic resin region with the battery buried in plastic. This type of mold temporarily retains the battery in position with alignment projections to form the molded plastic resin region.
<br/>
(5) By the processing steps above, the battery assembly, comprising output terminals <b>33</b>,<b>53</b>, printed circuit board <b>35</b>,<b>55</b>, molding holder <b>34</b>,<b>54</b>, and the battery <b>32</b>,<b>52</b>, is inserted in a fixed position and held within the molded plastic resin region <b>31</b>,<b>51</b>. Finally, the surface of the battery assembly is covered with tubing <b>39</b>,<b>59</b> to produce a completed battery pack. Heat-shrink tubing is used as the tubing <b>39</b>,<b>59</b>. After insertion of the battery assembly, the heat-shrink tubing is heated and shrunk to tightly cover the surface of the battery assembly.
