<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a compound, and in particular to a nano compound capable of data storage and an organic memory device comprising the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the development of flexible electronic material, organic material is popular due to its light weight, low cost, simple process ability, and large area fabrication capability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic non-volatile memory material (ONVM) can be widely applied in Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) holders and memory products. In terms of cost considerations, cheap ONVM is a suitable to substitute for conventional non-volatile memory materials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">ONVM material can be formed by low-conductivity organic compounds and metal nano particles. When an external bias is applied, electrons are transferred from organic compound to metal nano particle. After applying a counter bias, electrons return to the organic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">UCLA Prof. Yang Yang provided an organic memory device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,950,331. Organic compounds and metal nano particles, however, are randomly blended in a polymer solution. Meanwhile, the low melting point of the organic compound will cause a low thermal stability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In 2005, Yang Yang provided another organic memory device disclosed in Applied Physics Letter 86, 123507 (2005). The ONVM material is composed of 2-naphthalenethiol-gold nanoparticle. The memory device, however, is Write-once-Read Many times (WORM) and has an I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off </sub>ratio less than 10<sup>4</sup>, without rewritable performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention provides a nano compound comprising a metal or oxide thereof and an organic compound capable of oxidation and reduction bonded to the metal or oxide thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The metal has a work function of about 2&#x2dc;8 eV, preferably 4&#x2dc;6 eV, and may comprise gold. The metal or oxide thereof has a diameter less than 100 nm, preferably less than 15 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The organic compound may be a conjugated molecule, and may comprise hydroxyquinoline such as 8-hydroxyquinoline.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The organic compound is bonded to the metal or oxide thereof with a nonresonance organic chain. The organic chain may further comprise nitrogen atoms such that a carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen-carbon chain is built. The organic chain has a length of less than 10 nm, preferably less than 6 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The metal or oxide thereof may serve as an electron acceptor. The organic compound may serve as an electron donor. Electrons are transferred therebetween by applying an external bias such as positive bias or negative bias, for example, when a positive bias is applied, electrons are transferred from the organic compound (electron donor) to the metal or oxide thereof (electron acceptor). When a negative bias is applied, electrons return to the organic compound. The electronic transition is attributed to the electric-field-induced charge transfer. The metal or oxide thereof achieves and remains a high-conductivity state while electrons are received thereby. After applying a counter bias, the metal or oxide thereof returns to the original low-conductivity state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The nano compound is filmed by dissolving in polymer solution, with concentration of about 5&#x2dc;50 wt %. The polymer has a conductivity less than 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mho/cm.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention also provides an organic memory device comprising a top and a bottom electrode and a polymer film comprising the disclosed nano compound sandwiched therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electrodes may comprise aluminum. The memory device has an applied voltage of about 1&#x2dc;10V and an I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off </sub>ratio exceeding 10<sup>4</sup>. The device is non-volatile and rewritable.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the organic memory device of the invention is disclosed. The memory device 20 comprises a top electrode 22 and a bottom electrode 26, and a polymer film 24 comprising the disclosed nano compound is installed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention provides an organic non-volatile memory material (ONVM) formed of a metal nano particle serving as an electron acceptor and an organic compound capable of oxidation and reduction serving as an electron donor. The distance of charge transfer is determined by length of a nonresonance organic chain formed therebetween. Applied voltage and I<sub>on</sub>/I<sub>off </sub>ratio of memory device can also be controlled thereby. Additionally, phase separation caused by metal aggregation can thus be avoided due to formation of the nonresonance organic chain.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When a positive bias is applied, the metal nano particle receives electrons transferred from the organic compound, exhibiting a high-conductivity state. The high-conductivity state remains due to the non-volatile property of ONVM material. Next, metal nano particle releases electrons after applying a negative bias thereto and returns to the original low-conductivity state. These operations, including application of positive or negative bias, can be repeated such that the memory device is rewritable.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when data is erased by applying a negative 2V bias, the current value of the memory device can return to the original state before written, exhibiting rewritable performance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The nano compound is prepared as follows. A functional group capable of oxidation and reduction such as hydroxyl group, pyridene, or thiole of an organic compound such as hydroxyquinoline, indole, or thiophene is protected by a protector such as ether or ester group. Next, a nonresonance organic chain such as alkyl or. cycloalkyl is bonded to the organic compound. The terminal of the organic chain is then replaced by a mercaptan group. After removing the protector; the-organic compound is bonded to a metal or oxide thereof such as gold or palladium with the nonresonance organic chain to form the nano compound.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">0.74 g 5-(12-bromo-dodecane)-8-methoxyquinoline (BDMQ) (1.82 mmol) and 40 mL ethanol were added to a 100 mL round-bottom flask with violent stirring with reflux. 0.45 g NaSH.XH<sub>2</sub>O (68%, 5.46 mmol) was then added and reacted at 85&#xb0; C. in an oil bath for 3 hours. After re-concentration, brown oil-like results and unreacted NaSH solid were obtained. The oil-like results were then extracted by adding 100 mL deionized water and 100 mL ether 3 times to remove the NaSH solid and ethanol to form a colorless extract solution comprising an aqueous phase and a oil phase. The oil phase was then re-concentrated to remove ether and purified by SiO<sub>2 </sub>column (250 mL EA/n-hexane ( 1/9)). After removing solvent by re-concentration, 0.5 g yellow oil-like 5-(12-thiol-dodecane)-8-methoxyquinoline (TDMQ) was obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">0.12 g hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (0.30 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL deionized water to form a first solution. 0.11 g 5-(12-thiol-dodecane)-8-hydroxyquinoline (TDHQ) (0.32 mmol) and 0.58 g tetraoctylammonium bromide (1.06 mmol) were added to 50 mL p-xylene to form a second solution. Next, the first and second solutions were added to a 250 mL round-bottom flask with violent stirring. 0.147 g NaBH4 (3.89 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water to prepare a reductant. Next, the reductant was added and reacted with violent stirring for 3 hours to form a solution comprising an aqueous phase and an oil phase. The oil phase was then re-concentrated to form about 5 mL resulting solution. Next, the resulting solution was precipitated by adding dried methanol. The suspension was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 15 min) to precipitate Au&#x2014;NPs. Au&#x2014;NPs solid was washed by deionized water and methanol 3 times, respectively, to remove unreacted substance and salts. After drying; 0.05 g purple 8-hydroxyquiline-gold particle solid was prepared, ranging from 5 nm to 45 nm.</p>
