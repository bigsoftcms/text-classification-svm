<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a pre-molding leadframe strip, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing a pre-molding leadframe strip with compact components. The disclosure of the present invention can be applied to a surface-mountable electronic component, such as, but not limited to, light-emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As well known to those skilled in the art, a light-emitting diode composed of a compound semiconductor, such as GaAs, AlGaAs, GaN, InGaN or AlGaInP, as a light-emitting source, is a semiconductor device capable of emitting light of various colors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With great advances in semiconductor techniques, light-emitting diode devices have been produced to have high luminance and quality characteristics. In addition, fabrication of blue and white diodes has been practically realized, whereby the light-emitting diodes are widely applicable to displays, next-generation lighting sources and the like. Besides, a surface mountable light-emitting diode device is available.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to expand the areas of use and in order to reduce production costs, attempts are being made to produce electronic components of ever smaller structural sizes and to arrange more components in a certain area. By way of example, the backlighting of the keys of mobile telephones requires very small light-emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further compactness of the devices is desirable, but is extremely difficult using conventionally available processes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>c </i>are top views illustrating a manufacturing process of a conventional pre-molding leadframe strip. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a leadframe strip <b>10</b> with an array of component regions <b>22</b><i>a </i>is formed for supporting light-emitting diode chips by punching out the leadframe strip <b>10</b> from a metal sheet or a foil. Each component region <b>22</b><i>a </i>includes two metal parts <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>a </i>for mounting a light-emitting diode chip thereon, and comprises a wire-bonded portion and an external electrical connection as well as two empty spaces <b>28</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The leadframe strip <b>10</b> is then plated with a metal layer <b>20</b> having high conductivity and die bonding adhesion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An array of pre-molded structures <b>42</b><i>a </i>are formed to surround portions of the leadframe strip <b>10</b> with the exception of only electrode portions to be used as the external lead electrodes by means of a pre-molding process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>. The conventional pre-molding process is a single step cold runner process and implemented with a sprue <b>30</b> and multiple forked runners <b>32</b>. Each of the pre-molded structures <b>42</b><i>a </i>formed by the pre-molding process is in the form of polyhedron having an inner cavity to easily mount a desirable target therein, in which a surface facing the component region <b>22</b><i>a </i>is opened. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the detailed pre-molded structure <b>42</b><i>a </i>and the resulted component region <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The finished component region <b>22</b><i>a </i>includes a function area <b>48</b><i>a </i>composed of the chip-attached portion <b>47</b><i>a </i>and the wire-bonded portion <b>49</b><i>a</i>, the pre-molded structures <b>42</b><i>a</i>, the empty spaces <b>28</b><i>a </i>and two exposed external electrode portions <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>a</i>. The external electrode portions <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the component region <b>22</b><i>a </i>will then be folded to make mountable electrode structures during subsequent packaging processes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, such a conventional pre-molding process is disadvantageous in terms of lower throughput as well as leadframe and molding material waste, resulting from loose arrangement of effective component regions caused by space required by forked runners in a single injection molding process. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>c</i>, the conventional pre-molded process is low in mass production efficiency, since a density of the component regions is limited by the single pre-molding process. Moreover, use of such a single pre-molding process means the actual area occupied by the components is very low, thus significantly lowering utilization of precious materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An objective of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned problems and to provide a method for manufacturing a pre-molding leadframe strip with compact components that has much better materials utilization and mass production efficiency, characterized by compact components arrangement formed by a multiplicity of pre-molding processes with hot runners.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention achieves the above-indicated objective by providing a method for manufacturing a pre-molding leadframe strip with compact components by first forming a leadframe strip with an array of component regions, each component region including two metal parts for using as a chip-attached portion, a wire-bonded portion and two external electrical connection conductors. Next, the leadframe strip is plated with a metal layer having high conductivity and die bonding adhesion. Finally, a pre-molded structure on each of the component regions is formed to surround all the other portions of the leadframe strip with an exception of only the two external electrical connection conductors through a multiplicity of pre-molding processes, each pre-molding process molding the leadframe strip at an interval of one or more than one component regions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following detailed description, given by way of example and not intended to limit the invention solely to the embodiments described herein, will best be understood in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention discloses a method for manufacturing a pre-molding leadframe strip with compact components that is applicable to a surface-mountable electronic component, such as, but not limited to, light-emitting diodes. Reducing the distance between adjacent components increases the amount of components per unit area. Obtaining a minimum distance between adjacent components within a leadframe strip would require a multiplicity of pre-molding processes but increase materials utilization and mass production efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A leadframe <b>60</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a planar sheet and has an array of component regions <b>22</b>. The leadframe strip <b>60</b> is formed to support light emitting diode chips by stamping out the leadframe strip <b>60</b> from a metal sheet or a foil. The leadframe strip <b>60</b> is a metal selected from a group consisting of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), chromium (Cr) and alloys thereof. Each component region <b>22</b> includes two metal parts used to mount a light-emitting diode chip thereon, as a chip-attached portion <b>47</b>, a wire-bonded portion <b>49</b> and external electrical connection conductors (electrode portions) as well as two empty spaces <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The leadframe strip <b>60</b> is then plated with a metal layer <b>70</b> having high conductivity and die bonding adhesion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The plated metal layer is selected from a group consisting of Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd and alloys thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, an array of pre-molded structures <b>42</b> are formed to respectively surround portions of the component regions <b>22</b> of the leadframe strip <b>60</b> with an exception of only electrode portions to be used as the external lead electrodes through a multiplicity of pre-molding processes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. Each pre-molding process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>is used for molding the leadframe strip <b>60</b> at an interval of one component region <b>22</b>. Thus, two pre-molding processes are required for completing pre-molding the leadframe strip <b>60</b> at the interval of one component region <b>22</b>. For example, a first pre-molding process is implemented to process the component regions <b>22</b> in odd columns such as first, third, fifth and seventh columns, etc. Then, a second pre-molding process is implemented to process the component regions <b>22</b> in even columns such as second, fourth, sixth and eighth columns, etc. The resultant layout of the leadframe strip <b>60</b> after completing pre-molding can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A molding material used at the pre-molding process is made of non-light-transmittable plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to upgrade the quality of the pre-molding structures and efficiently utilize the molding material, the present invention introduces hot runners into the pre-molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pre-molding process of the present invention is a multiplicity of pre-molding and hot runner processes and implemented with hot runners <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Each hot runner <b>80</b> has multiple forked runners <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, each of the hot runners <b>80</b> of one of the pre-molding processes can possess a temperature, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Nine hot runners <b>80</b> are used in the pre-molding process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and these nine hot runners <b>80</b> can be separated into A<b>1</b> through A<b>9</b>, nine temperature regions. The range of processing temperature of each of the temperature regions depends on a type of molding compounds, generally between 150-400&#xb0; C. Therefore, with the manipulation of the temperature regions A<b>1</b>-A<b>9</b>, a better yield of pre-molding products can be achieved via adjusting the temperature of each hot runner <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Likewise, each of the pre-molded structures <b>42</b> formed by the process of the present invention is also in the form of polyhedron having an inner cavity to easily mount a desirable target therein, in which a surface facing the component region <b>22</b> is opened. The detailed pre-molded structures <b>42</b> and the resultant component region <b>22</b> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. The finished component region <b>22</b> includes a function area <b>48</b> composed of the chip-attached portion <b>47</b> and the wire-bonded portion <b>49</b>, the pre-molded structures <b>42</b>, the empty spaces <b>28</b> and two exposed external electrode portions <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. The external electrode portions <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> of the component region <b>22</b> will then be folded to make mountable electrode structures during subsequent packaging processes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Alternatively, each of the multiplicity of pre-molding processes of the present invention used for molding the leadframe strip <b>60</b> can be at an interval of two component regions <b>22</b>. Thus, three pre-molding processes are required for completing pre-molding the leadframe strip <b>60</b> at the interval of two component regions <b>22</b>. The resultant layout of the leadframe strip <b>60</b> after completing pre-molding can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The alteration of another multiplicity of pre-molding processes is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Each of the pre-molding process in this alteration is implemented with hot runners <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Each hot runner <b>90</b> has multiple forked runners <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Likewise, each of the hot runners <b>90</b> of one of the pre-molding processes also can possess its own temperature, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Six hot runners <b>90</b> are used in the pre-molding process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and these six hot runners <b>90</b> can be separated into B<b>1</b> through B<b>6</b>, six temperature regions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each runner hot runner <b>90</b> may further have a heating device <b>93</b> mounted around and contacting the hot runner <b>90</b> to keep the forked runners <b>92</b> in a desired temperature range that maintains the molding material in the forked runner <b>92</b> in a melted state. The heating device <b>93</b> prevents the melted molding material in the forked runners <b>93</b> from unexpectedly cooling down and solidifying before the molding material is injected on the leadframe strip <b>60</b> due to non-uniform heat distribution of the forked runners <b>92</b>. Therefore, a defect rate of the finished component regions <b>22</b> on the leadframe strip <b>60</b> is effectively lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Compared to the conventional method, the present invention has several advantages. First, the embodiments enable the leadframe to be produced simply and cost-effectively by stamping out the leadframe from a metal sheet or a foil. Second, since the density of the component regions is maximized, materials utilization and mass production efficiency are dramatically higher than the conventional method. Finally, due to the manipulation of the temperature of each hot runner, an improved yield of the pre-molding products can be achieved.</p>
