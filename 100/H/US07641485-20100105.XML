<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a lever-type connector and to a connector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H08-162209 discloses a lever-type connector with first and second housings that can be connected with one another. The first housing is formed with a supporting shaft and a lever is formed with a bearing hole mounted rotatably on the supporting shaft. The lever is formed with a cam groove and the second housing is formed with a cam follower that can engage in the cam groove. The first and second housing are fit lightly together with the lever at an initial position so that the cam follower enters the cam groove. The lever then is rotated to a connected position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A retaining projection is formed at the leading end of the supporting shaft and a cutout is formed in the inner circumference of the bearing hole. The retaining projection and the cutout are aligned to permit engagement of the supporting shaft and the bearing hole only when the lever is at an assembled position that is reached by rotating the lever from the initial position in a direction opposite to the rotational direction toward the connection position. The retaining projection is not aligned with the cutout and engages the opening edge of the bearing hole in the process of rotating the lever between the initial position and the connection position, i.e. in the process of connecting or separating the two housings. Therefore the bearing hole is not disengaged from the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The connecting operation of the above-described connector is started with the lever at the initial position. Thus, a positioning projection is formed on the first housing and a positioning hole is formed on the lever. The positioning projection engages the positioning hole to hold the lever at the initial position. However, the positioning projection abrades against the inner surface of the lever in the process of rotating the lever from the assembled position to the initial position. Hence the positioning projection may be deformed and crushed. An engagement margin between the positioning projection and the positioning hole decreases if the positioning projection is crushed, and the lever is held less reliably at the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A resiliently deformable locking projection might be provided on the first housing or the lever and a locking recess could be provided on the other of the first housing and the lever for engaging the locking projection in an effort to avoid the above-described problem. According to this construction, the locking projection can be deformed resiliently to escape from a mating member in the process of rotating the lever from the assembled position to the initial position. Therefore, the locking projection is not likely to be broken.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the locking projection of this possible connector would be pressed against the mating member due to its resilient restoring force. Thus, the locking projection may possibly be deformed upon mounting the lever.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention was developed in view of the above, and an object thereof is to improve the reliability of holding a lever at an initial position.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention relates to a lever-type connector or connector of the movable member type. The connector has a housing that is connectable with a mating housing. The housing includes a supporting shaft and a lever or movable member is mounted displaceably on the housing. The lever has a cam functioning portion that can engage a cam follower of the mating housing by lightly connecting the housing with the mating housing while the lever is at an initial position. The lever then is displaced toward a connection position and this displacement generates a cam action between the cam functioning portion and the cam follower housing for urging the housing toward a connected position with the mating housing. A retaining projection is formed on the outer surface of the leading end of the supporting shaft and a cutout is formed in the lever. The cutout does not correspond to the retaining projection in the process of displacing the lever between the initial position and the connection position and permits passage of the retaining projection only when the lever is at an assembled position at a side of the initial position opposite to the connection position. A resilient arm is formed on the housing or the lever and is deformable in a direction intersecting a displacement direction of the lever. A locking projection is formed on the resilient arm and a locking recess is formed in the other of the housing and the lever. The locking recess can engage the locking projection only when the lever is at the initial position and holds the lever. A resilient escaping portion is formed at one of the housing and the lever with the locking recess. The escaping portion can resiliently deform away from the locking projection and can slide on the locking projection as the lever is displaced between the assembled position and the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Upon assembling the lever with the housing, the bearing hole is engaged with the supporting shaft while the retaining projection is passed through the cutout with the lever held at the assembled position. Thereafter, both the resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion are deformed away from each other upon displacing the lever from the assembled position toward the initial position. Thus, a degree of resilient deformation of the resilient arm is reduced, and hence the restoring force of the resilient arm is reduced as compared with the case where only the resilient arm is deformed. Therefore, the locking projection is not likely to be crushed by the resilient restoring force of the resilient arm and the lever is held reliably at the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lever preferably is mounted rotatably on the housing by the engagement of a bearing hole, and the cutout is formed in the lever in the inner circumferential surface of the bearing hole.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The resilient escaping portion preferably is arranged before the supporting shaft in a connecting direction of the housing with the mating housing and is arranged to correspond to the locking projection in a direction at an angle to the connecting direction of the housing with the mating housing when the bearing hole and the supporting shaft are aligned at the same position to hold the lever in substantially the same posture as at the assembled position with the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The locking projection contacts the resilient escaping portion when the lever is assembled with the housing from the front in substantially the same posture as at the assembled position. Thus, the resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion deform resiliently in the assembling process. Accordingly, the resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion are deformed in the process of displacing the lever from the assembled position to the initial position and also in the process of assembling the lever with the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The housing preferably has an escaping groove that extends toward the supporting shaft from the front end of the housing for avoiding interference with the cam follower.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The locking recess preferably is formed by cutting the housing from the front end in substantially the same direction as the escaping groove.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A resilient escaping portion preferably is cantilevered forward in an area between the escaping groove and the locking recess. Thus, the resilient escaping portion is deformed more easily as compared with a resilient escaping portion having both ends supported on the housing and the degree of resilient deformation of the resilient arm is reduced by that much.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mating housing preferably has an unlocking projection that enters the locking recess in the process of connecting the housing with the mating housing. The unlocking projection displaces the locking projection in a direction to disengage from the locking recess and permits the lever to be displaced toward the connection position. Accordingly, it is not necessary to perform an operation of disengaging the locking projection from the locking recess.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion could be made to deform in radial directions toward and away from the supporting shaft. However, such a design would require the lever and the housing to be enlarged in radial directions to ensure space for the deformations of the resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion. Accordingly, deforming directions of the resilient arm and the resilient escaping portion preferably are substantially parallel to the axis of the supporting shaft. Therefore, the lever and the housing need not be enlarged in radial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention also relates to a connector assembly comprising the above-described lever-type connector and a mating connector.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings. It should be understood that even though embodiments are separately described, single features thereof may be combined to additional embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A lever-type connector assembly in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 12</figref>. The connector assembly includes a first housing <b>10</b>, a lever <b>20</b> mounted on the first housing <b>10</b> and a second housing <b>40</b> connectable with and separable from the first housing <b>10</b> along a connecting direction CD. Ends of the housings to be connected with each other are referred to herein as the front ends.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first housing <b>10</b> is made unitarily e.g. of synthetic resin and has a substantially block-shaped terminal accommodating portion <b>11</b>. Female terminal fittings (not shown) are accommodated in the terminal accommodating portion <b>11</b>. A substantially tubular fitting <b>12</b> extends forward from a rear end of the terminal accommodating portion <b>11</b> and at least partly surrounds the terminal accommodating portion <b>11</b>. A tubular connection space <b>13</b> is formed between the outer surface of the terminal accommodating portion <b>11</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the tubular fitting <b>12</b>. The connection space <b>13</b> is open at the front end of the first housing <b>10</b> for receiving part of the second housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Supporting shafts <b>14</b> project laterally out from the opposite left and right walls of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and are substantially orthogonal to the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>. The supporting shafts <b>14</b> are near the center in the vertical direction and are near the rear end in the connecting direction CD with the second housing <b>40</b>. Each supporting shaft <b>14</b> has a cylindrical shaft main body <b>15</b> and two retaining projections <b>16</b> project radially out in opposite directions from positions at or near the projecting end of the shaft main body <b>15</b>. The retaining projections <b>16</b> extend in forward and backward directions and hence are aligned substantially parallel to the connecting directions CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Escaping grooves <b>17</b> are formed in each of the opposite left and right walls of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and extend substantially straight back in directions substantially parallel to the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>. The escaping grooves <b>17</b> are at the same height as the supporting shafts <b>14</b> in a vertical direction. Additionally, the escaping grooves <b>17</b> open at the front end edge of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and provide communication between the outer surface of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and the connection space <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each of the opposite left and right walls of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> also is formed with a locking recess <b>18</b> at a position different from the supporting shaft <b>14</b> and the escaping groove <b>17</b> in the vertical direction. The locking recesses <b>18</b> extend substantially straight back from the front end of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> in directions substantially parallel to the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> and in substantially the same direction as the escaping grooves <b>17</b>. The locking recesses <b>18</b> are open at the front end of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and provide communication between the outer surface of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and the connection space <b>13</b>. The rear ends of the locking recesses <b>18</b> are more backward than the rear ends of the escaping grooves <b>17</b> and more forward than the axial lines of the supporting shafts <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Areas on each of the left and right walls of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> between the escaping grooves <b>17</b> and the locking recesses <b>18</b> define forwardly cantilevered resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> that are resiliently deformable about their rear ends. The escaping portions <b>19</b> can deform resiliently in lateral directions substantially parallel with the axial lines of the supporting shafts <b>14</b> and substantially orthogonal to the connecting and separating directions CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>. The escaping portions <b>19</b> are more forward than the supporting shafts <b>14</b> in the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The lever <b>20</b> is made e.g. of synthetic resin to include an operable portion <b>21</b> and two laterally symmetrical plate-like arms <b>22</b> that project unitarily from the operable portion <b>21</b>. The arms <b>22</b> extend parallel with each other from opposite lateral ends of the operable portion <b>21</b>. A bearing hole <b>23</b> penetrates each arm <b>22</b> from the outer surface to the inner surface. Each bearing hole <b>23</b> has two symmetrically opposed circularly generated arcuate sections <b>24</b> and two symmetrically opposed substantially rectangular cutouts <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bearing holes <b>23</b> can be engaged rotatably with the supporting shafts <b>14</b> of the first housing <b>10</b> by deforming the arms <b>22</b> away from each other, locating the bearing holes <b>23</b> on the same axis as the supporting shafts <b>14</b> and aligning the cutouts <b>25</b> with the retaining projections <b>16</b>. The arms <b>22</b> are adjacent to and facing the outer surfaces of the opposite side walls of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is mounted on the first housing <b>10</b> and the operable portion <b>21</b> is arranged above the first housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The lever <b>20</b> has an assembled position AP (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>) where the operable portion <b>21</b> is located above the first housing <b>10</b> and the cutouts <b>25</b> and the retaining projections <b>16</b> are aligned so that the retaining projections <b>16</b> can pass the cutouts <b>25</b>. The lever <b>20</b> can be rotated back by a small angle from the assembled position AP to an initial position IP (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> to displace the operable portion <b>21</b> back. The lever <b>20</b> also can be rotated a large amount from the assembled position AP toward a side opposite to the initial position IP and to a connection position CP (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Preferably, the sum of an angle of rotation from the assembled position AP to the initial position IP (about 10&#xb0; to about 20&#xb0; in this embodiment) and an angle of rotation from the initial position IP to the connection position CP (about 80&#xb0; to about 100&#xb0;, preferably about 90&#xb0; in this embodiment) is smaller than 180&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A cam groove <b>26</b> is formed in the surface of each arm <b>22</b> that faces the side wall of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> and extends back from the front edge of the respective arm <b>22</b> that is substantially orthogonal to the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the initial position IP. Each cam groove <b>26</b> has an entrance <b>27</b> extending substantially straight from the front edge of the arm <b>22</b> toward the bearing hole <b>23</b> and a cam operating portion <b>28</b> that extends from the rear end of the entrance <b>27</b> in an arcuate manner to gradually approach the bearing hole <b>23</b>. The entrances <b>27</b> of the cam grooves <b>26</b> correspond to the escaping grooves <b>17</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the initial position IP.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A substantially U-shaped cut-out <b>29</b> penetrates each arm <b>22</b> from the inner surface to the outer surface in an area above the cam groove <b>26</b> and the bearing hole <b>23</b> and before the bearing hole <b>23</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the initial position IP. A resilient arm <b>30</b> is cantilevered forward in each cutout <b>29</b>. The resilient arms <b>30</b> are resiliently deformable in lateral directions substantially parallel to the axes of the supporting shafts <b>14</b> and substantially orthogonal to the connecting and separating directions CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> with the rear ends of the arms <b>30</b> as supports. A locking projection <b>31</b> is formed at a front extending end of each resilient arm <b>30</b> and projects in when the resilient arm <b>30</b> is in a free undeformed state.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The resilient arms <b>30</b> face the locking recesses <b>18</b> and the locking projections <b>31</b> engage the upper and lower edges of the locking recesses <b>18</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the initial position IP. This engagement holds the lever <b>20</b> at the initial position IP and prevents displacement toward the assembled position AP and the connection position CP. The locking projections <b>31</b> are located before and above the bearing holes <b>23</b> and are between the locking recesses <b>18</b> and the escaping grooves <b>17</b>. Thus, the locking projections <b>31</b> face the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the assembled position AP.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second housing <b>40</b> is made e.g. of synthetic resin and has a terminal holding portion <b>41</b> for holding male terminal fittings (not shown). A rectangular tubular receptacle <b>42</b> projects unitarily forward from the terminal holding portion <b>41</b>. Cam followers <b>43</b> project from the outer surfaces of the opposite left and right walls of the receptacle <b>42</b>. The cam followers <b>43</b> are substantially cylindrical and are at positions corresponding to the supporting shafts <b>14</b> and the escaping grooves <b>17</b> in the vertical direction, which is substantially orthogonal to the connecting direction CD with the first housing <b>10</b>. Long narrow unlocking ribs <b>44</b> extend in forward and backward directions at positions above the cam followers <b>43</b> on the opposite left and right outer surfaces of the receptacle <b>42</b>. The unlocking ribs <b>44</b> are at vertical positions corresponding to the locking recesses <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lever <b>20</b> is mounted on the first housing <b>10</b> and is held in the same posture as the assembled position AP relative to the first housing <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that the cutouts <b>25</b> of the bearing holes <b>23</b> align with the retaining projections <b>16</b> in circumferential directions of the supporting shafts <b>14</b>. The lever <b>20</b> is positioned vertically relative to the first housing <b>10</b> so that the bearing holes <b>23</b> are at substantially the same height as the supporting shafts <b>14</b>. In this state, the lever <b>20</b> is brought closer to the first housing <b>10</b> from the front along a moving direction substantially parallel to the connecting direction CD of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>. In other words, the lever <b>20</b> is assembled with the first housing <b>10</b> while being moved along a path so as not to change the heights of the supporting shafts <b>14</b> and the bearing holes <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lever <b>20</b> temporarily deforms during assembly to widen the spacing between the arms <b>22</b>, and the bearing holes <b>23</b> are fit on the shaft main bodies <b>15</b> of the supporting shafts <b>14</b>. The arms <b>22</b> then restore resiliently and move toward one another. As a result, the retaining projections <b>16</b> pass the cutouts <b>25</b> to mount the lever <b>20</b> on the first housing <b>10</b> at the assembled position AP. The retaining projections <b>16</b> pass the bearing holes <b>23</b> as the lever <b>20</b> is assembled. The lever <b>20</b> then is rotated away from the assembled position AP so that the retaining projections <b>16</b> engage the opening edges of the arcuate sections <b>24</b> of the bearing holes <b>23</b> from the outside the arms <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The locking projections <b>31</b> contact the outer surfaces of the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> in the process of assembling the lever <b>20</b> on the first housing <b>10</b> and in a state where arms <b>22</b> of the lever <b>20</b> are not deformed away from each other. Thus, the resilient arms <b>30</b> deformed inwardly and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> deform outwardly. The arms <b>22</b> then are moved away from each other so that the bearing hole <b>23</b> can engage the supporting shafts <b>14</b>. As a result, the arms <b>22</b>, on which the locking projections <b>31</b> are formed, separate from the tubular fitting <b>12</b>, on which the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> are formed. Thus, degrees deformation of the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> temporarily decrease. The resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> are deformed resiliently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the bearing holes <b>23</b> are engaged with the supporting shafts <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The lever <b>20</b> is rotated from the assembled position AP to the initial position IP after the bearing holes <b>23</b> are engaged on the supporting shafts <b>14</b>. As a result, the locking projections <b>31</b> slide on the outer surfaces of the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> with the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> kept resiliently deformed. The locking projections <b>31</b> disengage from the upper edges of the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> when the lever <b>20</b> reaches the initial position IP so that the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> restore resiliently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Therefore, the lower surfaces of the locking projections <b>31</b> engage the lower edges of the locking recesses <b>18</b> (i.e. upper edges of the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b>) from above and the upper surfaces of the locking projections <b>31</b> engage the upper edges of the locking recesses <b>18</b> from below, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. These engagements prevent displacement of the lever <b>20</b> toward the assembled position AP and toward the connection position CP. As a result, the lever <b>20</b> is held at the initial position IP. The retaining projections <b>16</b> engage the outer edges of the bearing holes <b>23</b> when the lever <b>20</b> is at the initial position IP to prevent displacements of the bearing holes <b>23</b> relative to the supporting shafts <b>14</b> in an axial direction and to hold the lever <b>20</b> mounted on the supporting shafts <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are connected lightly while the receptacle <b>42</b> of the second housing <b>40</b> is fit partly into the connection space of the first housing <b>10</b> with the lever <b>20</b> held at the initial position IP. In the fit-in process, the cam followers <b>43</b> enter the entrances <b>27</b> of the cam grooves <b>26</b> and the unlocking ribs <b>44</b> enter the locking recesses <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thus, the unlocking ribs <b>44</b> press the inner sides of the resilient arms <b>30</b> and deform the resilient arms <b>30</b> out in a disengagement direction to disengage the locking projections <b>31</b> from the locking recesses <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The disengagement of the locking projections <b>31</b> from the locking recesses <b>18</b> frees the lever <b>20</b> from a rotation prevented state and permits the lever <b>20</b> to be rotated toward the connection position CP. Further connection of the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> is prevented when the cam followers <b>43</b> contact the rear ends of the entrances <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this state, the operable portion <b>21</b> is gripped to rotate the lever <b>20</b> toward the connection position CP. As a result, the cam grooves <b>26</b> engage the cam followers <b>43</b> to urge the housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> together. During this time, the locking projections <b>31</b> are disengaged from the unlocking portions <b>44</b> and slide on the outer surfaces of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> with the resilient arms <b>30</b> kept resiliently deformed. Therefore the arms <b>22</b> try to displace away from the outer surfaces of the tubular fitting <b>12</b> due to resilient restoring forces of the resilient arms <b>30</b>. However, the retaining projections <b>16</b> engage the edges of the bearing holes <b>23</b> from the outer sides. Thus, the arms <b>22</b> cannot displace away from the outer surfaces of the tubular fitting <b>12</b>. In this way, the cam grooves <b>26</b> and the cam followers <b>43</b> are kept engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are connected properly when the lever <b>20</b> reaches the connection position CP and the lever <b>20</b> is locked at the connection position CP by the engagement of a lock arm <b>21</b><i>a </i>on the operable portion <b>21</b> and a lock <b>10</b><i>a </i>at the rear end of the upper surface of the first housing <b>10</b>. As a result, the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are locked in a properly connected state.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> both deform resiliently away from the mating sides while rotating the lever <b>20</b> from the assembled position to the initial position IP. Thus, the degrees of resilient deformation, i.e. resilient restoring forces of the resilient arms <b>30</b> are reduced as compared with a case where only the resilient arms <b>30</b> deform. Therefore, the lever <b>20</b> is held reliably at the initial position IP by suppressing the deformation that could crush the locking projections <b>31</b> due to the resilient restoring forces of the resilient arms <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The lever <b>20</b> is assembled with the first housing <b>10</b> from the front in substantially the same posture as at the assembled position AP. Thus, the locking projections <b>31</b> contact the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> and the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> are deformed resiliently in the assembling process. Accordingly, the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> are deformed resiliently in the process of rotating the lever <b>20</b> from the assembled position to the initial position IP and also in the process of assembling the lever <b>20</b> with the first housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each resilient escaping portion <b>19</b> is supported at only one end and therefore is more easily resiliently deformed than a resilient escaping portion supported at both ends, and resilient displacement amounts of the resilient arms <b>30</b> are reduced by that much.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The unlocking ribs <b>44</b> disengage the locking projections <b>31</b> from the locking recesses <b>18</b> when the second housing <b>40</b> is connected with the first housing <b>10</b> so that the lever <b>20</b> can be displaced toward the connection position CP. Accordingly, it is not necessary to perform a separate operation of disengaging the locking projections <b>31</b> from the locking recesses <b>18</b> in addition to the operation of lightly connecting the housings <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> deformed in radial directions toward and away from the supporting shafts <b>14</b>, the lever <b>20</b> and the first housing <b>10</b> would be enlarged in radial directions to ensure space for the deformations of the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b>. However, the resilient arms <b>30</b> and the resilient escaping portions <b>19</b> deform in directions substantially parallel to the axes of the supporting shafts <b>14</b> to avoid enlargement in radial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the above embodiment, upon assembling the lever with the first housing, the lever is held in the same posture as at the assembled position and is brought closer to the first housing from front. Thus, the locking projections contact the resilient escaping portions. However, the assembling mode is not limited to this and the lever also can be assembled in a different posture, at a different position and/or along a different movement path, e.g. the lever can be assembled with the first housing from front in a posture different from the one at the assembled position (e.g. posture at the initial position) or the lever can be assembled with the first housing obliquely from the front or above in the same posture as at the assembled position. In these assembling modes, the locking projections may not contact the resilient escaping portions in the assembling process, but the invention also is applicable to such assembling modes.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The locking recesses extend back from the front end of the first housing in the above embodiment. However, they may be closed in the form of windows without opening at the front end of the first housing.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The resilient escaping portions are cantilevered forward in the above embodiment. However, they may be supported at both ends.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The deforming directions of the locking projections and the resilient escaping portions are not limited to those parallel to the axes of the supporting shafts and may deform radially toward and away from the supporting shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The locking projections are disengaged from the locking recesses by the second housing in the above embodiment, but they may be disengaged from the locking recesses separately from the connecting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The cam functioning portions are cam grooves in the above embodiment, but they may be projections (ribs) according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lever is formed with the locking projections and the first housing is formed with the resilient escaping portions in the above embodiment. However, the first housing may be formed with locking projections and the lever may be formed with resilient escaping portions according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The invention also is applicable to a lever in the form of a plate having the cam means. Furthermore, the lever may be displaceable along any path, such as a substantially linear or bent path to display the cam action.</p>
