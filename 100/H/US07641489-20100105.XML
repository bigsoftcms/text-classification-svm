<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an Innovative structural design of a safety plug socket, and more particularly to a safety plug which provides power only when a pair of plug terminals are correctly inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A plug socket enables a pair of plug terminals to be inserted therein to effect the supply of power. The traditional plug socket is provided with socket holes in the outer housing, and conductive clips are internally fixed corresponding to the socket holes. The conductive clips are connected to an electric wire which provides a power source, and the conductive clips clamp the inserted terminals, thereby enabling the plug to effect the supply of power.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In prior art technology, in order to achieve preventing a metallic foreign body from being inserted into a plug socket and creating the danger of electric shock, movable cover plates are disposed within the socket holes to seal the socket holes. When not in use, the cover plates remain in a closed position to prevent the intrusion of foreign bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such prior art technology, because the conductive clips retain electric power, if a long thin or (squared-off) U-shaped metallic foreign body is made to extend into the socket holes and make contact with the conductive clips, there is still the possible danger of electric shock occurring. Thus the need for improvement exists.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A primary objective of the present invention is to provide a safety plug socket, wherein a safety plug supplies power to a plug for use by an electronic product connected thereto only when a pair of plug terminals is correctly inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the pair of plug terminals is incorrectly inserted or a metallic foreign body is inserted, then electric conduction is not realized, thereby preventing the danger of an electric shock.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is primarily structured to comprise a sliding insulating base disposed within an outer housing of a safety plug socket. A pair of contact conducting strips is located on the bottom surface of the sliding insulating base, and conductive clips disposed internal of a pair of socket holes extend to the bottom portion of the outer housing and form folded strips. When a pair of plug terminals is correctly inserted, then the sliding insulating base is pressed down, thereby causing the lower contact conducting strips to make conductive contact with the folded strips, and causing clips on the conductive clips to make contact with the inserted plug terminals to supply power for use by an electronic product.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present invention provides a safety plug socket for plug terminals of electronic products to be inserted therein and effect the supply of power, wherein a safety plug socket <b>1</b> is primarily structured from an outer housing <b>2</b>, an electric wire <b>13</b>, at least one pair of conductive clips <b>7</b>, at least one sliding insulating base <b>3</b> and at least one pair of power contacts <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The outer housing <b>2</b> is structured from an upper case <b>21</b> and a lower case <b>22</b>, wherein the upper case <b>21</b> is provided with at least one pair of socket holes <b>23</b> to enable insertion of terminals <b>91</b> of a plug <b>9</b> therein; the number of pairs of socket holes <b>23</b> being designed according to needs, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts two pairs of the socket holes <b>23</b>. A cylindrical spring base <b>25</b> extends from a bottom portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>2</b> corresponding to the midpoint position of the respective pair of socket holes <b>23</b>, and the lower portion of a spring <b>8</b> is retained within the cylindrical spring base <b>25</b>. A guide column <b>26</b> used as support in the interspace of the spring <b>8</b> is further located within the cylindrical spring base <b>25</b>. An end of the electric wire <b>13</b> is connected to a plug <b>131</b> to enable effecting the supply of power, and the electric wire <b>13</b> extends into the outer housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The conductive clips <b>7</b> are in paired configuration, the number of pairs being in accordance with the number of pairs of the socket holes <b>23</b>, and the conductive clips <b>7</b> are disposed within the outer housing <b>2</b> corresponding to the pairs of socket holes <b>23</b>. Clips <b>71</b> of each of the conductive clips <b>7</b> are disposed internal of one of the socket holes <b>23</b>, and the conductive clips <b>7</b> are further provided with folded strips <b>72</b> extending to the bottom portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>2</b>. Moreover, a concavity <b>74</b> is defined in at least one side of the clips <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The number of sliding insulating bases <b>3</b> is in accordance with the number of pairs of the socket holes <b>23</b>, and each is provided with a horizontal plate <b>31</b>, and the center of the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> upwardly forms a cylinder <b>32</b>. At least one side of the cylinder <b>32</b> is provided with a protruding point <b>321</b> and configured to be opposite to the concavity <b>74</b> on the side of the clip <b>71</b> relative thereto. The bottom surface of the horizontal plate <b>31</b> is provided with a pair of contact conducting strips <b>4</b> corresponding to the folded strips <b>72</b> of the pair of conductive clips <b>7</b>. Moreover, the inside diameter of the cylinder <b>32</b> is greater than the outer diameter of the cylindrical spring base <b>25</b> and retains the upper portion of the spring <b>8</b>, which enables the pair of contact conducting strips <b>4</b> to maintain non-contact separation with the folded strips <b>72</b> in normal times.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The power contacts <b>6</b> are in paired configuration, the number of pairs being in accordance with the number of pairs of the socket holes <b>23</b>, and are disposed in a separated configuration within the outer housing <b>2</b> and conductively connected with the electric wire <b>13</b>. Moreover, the power contacts <b>6</b> are respectively conductively connected to the pair of contact conducting strips <b>4</b> on the bottom surface of the horizontal plate <b>31</b> of the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> using soft conducting strips <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, a pair of first contact points <b>5</b> extend from the pair of contact conducting strips <b>4</b>, and a pair of second contact points <b>11</b> extend from the folded strips <b>72</b>. When the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> is pressed down, the first contact points <b>5</b> make contact with the second contact points <b>11</b>, thereby causing the contact conducting strips <b>4</b> to make conductive contact with the folded strips <b>72</b>. A pair of contact portions <b>12</b> is located on top of the horizontal plate <b>31</b> of the sliding insulating base <b>3</b>, and the contact portions <b>12</b> respectively contact the pair of plug terminals <b>91</b> when inserted into the safety plug socket <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when using the present invention, the terminals <b>91</b> of the plug <b>9</b> are inserted into the socket holes <b>23</b> of the outer housing <b>2</b> until the plug terminals <b>91</b> make contact with the contact portions <b>12</b> of the sliding insulating base <b>3</b>, thereby causing the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> to be pressed down (as depicted by the arrow in the drawing), and causing the protruding point <b>321</b> on one side of the cylinder <b>32</b> to fixedly join with the concavity <b>74</b> on one side of the clip <b>71</b>. Moreover, the lower contact conducting strips <b>4</b> makes conductive contact with the folded strips <b>72</b> of the pair of conductive clips <b>7</b>, thereby enabling the plug to effect the supply of power and supply electricity for use by a connected electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the terminals <b>91</b> of the plug <b>9</b> are not correctly inserted, for example, when only one of the terminals <b>91</b> is inserted into the socket hole <b>23</b> as depicted in the drawing, then, from the structural configuration of the present invention, because the force subjected to the horizontal plate <b>31</b> of the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> is uneven, thus, the horizontal plate <b>31</b> becomes askew (in the direction as depicted by the arrow in the drawing), thereby causing the cylinder <b>32</b> to jam against the cylindrical spring base <b>25</b> and preventing horizontal plate <b>31</b> from being pressed down, thus, the contact conducting strips <b>4</b> do not make conductive contact with the folded strips <b>72</b>, and the conductive clips <b>7</b> will not enable current flow, thus avoiding the danger of electric shock.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the structure design of the present invention also comprises elongated holes <b>33</b> formed in the horizontal plate <b>31</b> at sides of the contact portions <b>12</b> corresponding to insertion positions of the plug terminals <b>91</b>, and a first hollow portion <b>41</b>, having an area larger than the elongated hole <b>33</b>, is formed in each of the contact conducting strips <b>4</b>, and a second hollow portion <b>73</b>, having an area larger than the elongated hole <b>33</b>, is formed in each of the folded strips <b>72</b>. Such a design causes metallic foreign bodies to pass through the elongated holes <b>33</b>, the first hollow portions <b>41</b> and the second hollow portions <b>73</b> when inserted into the socket holes <b>23</b>, and thus prevents the metallic foreign bodies from causing the sliding insulating base <b>3</b> to shift down, thereby preventing the metallic foreign bodies from coming in contact with the contact conducting strips <b>4</b>. Accordingly, metallic foreign bodies will not realize electric conduction after being inserted, thus achieving a safety effect, and in particular, provides a protective effect when a child inserts a metallic foreign body.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a situation whereby a long thin metallic foreign body <b>92</b> has been inserted into the socket hole <b>23</b>, and after a long thin metallic foreign body <b>92</b> has been inserted into the socket hole <b>23</b>, then a situation occurs whereby contact or non-contact is made with a top portion of the clips <b>71</b> of the conductive clip <b>7</b>. However, because the metallic foreign body <b>92</b> passes through the elongated hole <b>33</b>, the first hollow portion <b>41</b> and the second hollow portion <b>73</b>, thus, it will not press down on the sliding insulating base <b>3</b>, and the contact conducting strips <b>4</b> will not make conductive contact with the folded strips <b>72</b>. Hence, there is no electric current in the conductive clip <b>7</b>, thus, even if the metallic foreign body <b>92</b> does make contact with the clip <b>7</b>, there is no danger of an electric shock.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a situation whereby a (squared-off) U-shaped metallic foreign body <b>93</b> has been inserted, and after the squared-off U-shaped metallic foreign body <b>93</b> has been inserted into the socket holes <b>23</b>, then a situation occurs whereby contact or non-contact is made with top portions of the clips <b>71</b> of the conductive clips <b>7</b>. However, because the squared-off U-shaped metallic foreign body <b>93</b> passes through the elongated holes <b>33</b>, the first hollow portions <b>41</b> and the second hollow portions <b>73</b>, thus, it will not press down on the sliding insulating base <b>3</b>, and the contact conducting strips <b>4</b> will not make conductive contact with the folded strips <b>72</b>. Hence, there is no electric current in the conductive clips <b>7</b>, thus, even if the squared-off U-shaped metallic foreign body <b>93</b> does make contact with the clips <b>7</b>, there is no danger of an electric shock.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In conclusion, the innovative structure of the safety plug socket provided by the present invention only effects the supply of power after a pair of plug terminals are correctly inserted into the socket holes to supply power for use by an electronic products. However, there is no flow of electric current when the plug terminals are incorrectly inserted or other metallic foreign bodies are inserted, thus preventing the danger of an electric shock from occurring. Hence, the present invention completely complies with the essential elements as required for a new patent application. Accordingly, a new patent application is proposed herein.</p>
