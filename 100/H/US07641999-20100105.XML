<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention:</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fuel cell stack including a box-shaped casing and a stack body provided in the casing. The stack body is formed by stacking a plurality of unit cells. Each of the unit cells includes an electrolyte electrode assembly and separators sandwiching the electrolyte electrode assembly. The electrolyte electrode assembly includes a pair of electrodes, and an electrolyte interposed between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a solid polymer fuel cell employs a membrane electrode assembly which includes an anode and a cathode, and an electrolyte membrane (electrolyte) interposed between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte membrane is a polymer ion exchange membrane. The membrane electrode assembly and separators sandwiching the membrane electrode assembly make up a unit of a fuel cell (unit cell) for generating electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the fuel cell, a fuel gas such as a gas chiefly containing hydrogen (hereinafter also referred to as the &#x201c;hydrogen-containing gas&#x201d;) is supplied to the anode. A gas chiefly containing oxygen or air (hereinafter also referred to as the &#x201c;oxygen-containing gas&#x201d;) is supplied to the cathode. The catalyst of the anode induces a chemical reaction of the fuel gas to split the hydrogen molecule into hydrogen ions and electrons. The hydrogen ions move toward the cathode through the electrolyte membrane, and the electrons flow through an external circuit to the cathode, creating a DC electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, a predetermined number of, e.g., several tens to several hundreds of fuel cells are stacked together to form a fuel cell stack for achieving the desired level of electricity in power generation. Components of the fuel cell stack need to be tightened together reliably under pressure so that the internal resistance of the fuel cell does not increase, and the sealing performance for preventing leakage of reactant gases is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this regard, for example, a fuel cell stack disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-135344 is known. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the fuel cell stack includes a stack body <b>2</b> formed by stacking a plurality of unit cells <b>1</b>. At opposite ends of the stack body <b>2</b> in the stacking direction, end plates <b>3</b> are provided. Further, auxiliary plates <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are provided outside the end plates <b>3</b>. A pair of tightening bands <b>5</b> is provided along both sides of the stack body <b>2</b>. At ends of the tightening bands <b>5</b> and the auxiliary plates <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, cylindrical coupling members <b>6</b> are provided. The coupling members <b>6</b> have holes arranged in a straight line. A metal pin <b>7</b> is inserted into each of the coupling members <b>6</b> for coupling the tightening bands <b>5</b> and the auxiliary plates <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>together.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the disclosure, a plurality of bolts <b>8</b> are screwed into the auxiliary plate <b>4</b><i>a</i>. A plurality of belleville springs <b>9</b> are provided on the auxiliary plate <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, when the bolts <b>8</b> are screwed into the auxiliary plate <b>4</b><i>a</i>, the end plates <b>3</b> are pressed downwardly, and the belleville springs <b>9</b> on the auxiliary plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>are compressed. Thus, the required tightening pressure is applied to the stack body <b>2</b> through the pair of end plates <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-135344, the metal pins <b>7</b> are fitted into both of the coupling members <b>6</b> of the tightening bands <b>5</b> and the coupling members <b>6</b> of the auxiliary plates <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the distance between the auxiliary plates <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>does not change. Thus, when the tightening load applied to the fuel cell stack is reduced by aged deterioration or the like, it is necessary to tighten the plurality of bolts <b>8</b> for maintaining the desired tightening load.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-135344, in order to adjust the tightening load applied to the fuel cell stack, the bolts <b>8</b> as dedicated components for tightening are required. Therefore the additional dedicated components increase the weight of the fuel cell stack, and the size of the fuel cell stack in the stacking direction of the unit cells <b>1</b> disadvantageously.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a solution of the above problem, for example, a fuel cell stack disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-298901 is known. In the fuel cell stack, current collecting electrodes (terminal plates) are provided on the outside of a stack body formed by stacking a predetermined number of unit cells. Further, end plates are provided outside the terminal plates. The end plates are coupled to a casing by a hinge mechanism. The casing includes a plurality of panels (side plates) provided on upper, lower, left, and right sides between the end plates.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-298901, the bolts <b>8</b> disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-135344 are not required. Further, it is possible to use thin end plates. Thus, it is possible to achieve reduction in the overall size and weight of the fuel cell stack easily.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-298901, for example, a relatively large gap may be formed between the side plates of the casing and the sides of the stack body. Therefore, when an impact is applied to the fuel cell stack, positional displacement may occur in the stack body in the stacking direction, or the stack body may be vibrated undesirably. If the gap between the side plates and the sides of the stack body is excessively small, the side plates and the stack body contact unnecessarily.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the panels of the casing have a flat shape. For example, if a load is applied to the fuel cell stack in a twisting direction, or if vibrations are generated, deformation may occur in the panels. Thus, the position of the stack body may be displaced in the stacking direction. In this case, for example, the sealing performance is degraded undesirably.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the above, for example, a rib-panel having ribs may be adopted to increase the rigidity of the panel. However, since the tightening load is applied to the stack body in the stacking direction, when the load in the stacking direction is applied to the rib-panel, the rib-panel may be deformed undesirably by the load.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A general object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell stack having a simple and economical structure in which it is possible to adjust a gap or a state of the contact between a casing and a stack body.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, a main object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell stack having a light weight and compact structure in which it is possible to desirably maintain the rigidity of the casing, and reliably apply the desired tightening load in the stacking direction of a stack body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, another main object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell stack having a simple structure, in which a gap between a side plate of a casing and a stack body is adjusted suitably, and a state of the contact between the side plate and the stack body can be determined arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention relates to a fuel cell stack including a box-shaped casing and a stack body. The stack body is formed by stacking a plurality of unit cells. Each of the unit cells includes an electrolyte electrode assembly and separators sandwiching the electrolyte electrode assembly. The electrolyte electrode assembly includes a pair of electrodes, and an electrolyte interposed between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The casing includes end plates provided at opposite ends of the stack body in the stacking direction, a plurality of side plates provided on sides of the stack body, and coupling pins each for coupling the end plate and the side plate. The side plates include a first side plate and a second side plate provided adjacent to each other. The first side plate includes a flange for attaching the first side plate to the second side plate, and the center of the coupling pin for coupling the first side plate to the end plate is offset from a neutral surface of the first side plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The neutral surface of the first side plate herein means a surface in which the theoretical stress and distortion are estimated to be &#x201c;0 (zero)&#x201d; (a surface in which no compression occurs) when a bending stress is applied to the first side plate, assuming that the deformation in the cross section of the side plate is very small. The center of the coupling pin is provided on the neutral surface of the first side plate. Stated otherwise, the neutral axis of the first side plate (the intersection line between the neutral surface and the cross section) and the central axis of the coupling pin are on the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, it is preferable that the width of the first side plate is smaller than the width of the second side plate. The load in the longitudinal direction applied to the first side plate on the short side is considerably small in comparison with the load in the longitudinal direction applied to the second side plate on the long side. Therefore, deformation of the first side plate by the offset is small. Thus, with the simple structure, deformation of the first and second side plates by the load in the longitudinal direction is reduced effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, according to another aspect of the present invention, the casing includes end plates provided at opposite ends of the stack body in the stacking direction, a plurality of side plates provided on sides of the stack body, and coupling pins each for coupling the end plate and the side plate. At least one of the side plates is a rib-panel, and the center of the coupling pin is provided on the neutral surface of the rib-panel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The neutral surface of the rib-panel herein means a surface in which the theoretical stress and distortion are estimated to be &#x201c;0 (zero)&#x201d; (a surface in which no compression occurs) when a bending stress is applied to the rib-panel, assuming that the deformation in the cross section of the panel is very small. The center of the coupling pin is provided on the neutral surface of the rib-panel. Stated otherwise, the neutral axis of the rib-panel (the intersection line between the neutral surface and the cross section) and the central axis of the coupling pin are on the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, it is preferable that the position of a rib of the rib-panel is determined such that the center of the plate thickness of the rib-panel is provided on the neutral surface. The rib may be formed integrally with the panel. Alternatively, the rib may be formed separately from the panel, and attached to the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, according to still another aspect of the present invention, the casing includes end plates provided at opposite ends of the stack body in the stacking direction, a plurality of side plates provided on sides of the stack body, and coupling pins each for coupling the end plate and the side plate. In at least one of the side plates, the center of the coupling pin is offset from a neutral surface of the side plate such that the side plate has a deformation portion which is deformed along the stacking direction of the stack body.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, it is preferable that at least one of the side plates is a rib-panel including a panel and a rib which is formed integrally with or separately from the panel. In the structure, it is possible to improve the rigidity of the side plate itself.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present invention, by applying a tightening load to the stack body, when a load is applied to the coupling pin along the stacking direction, the center of the coupling pin is offset from the neutral surface of the first side plate. Therefore, a force in a bending direction is applied to the first side plate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At this time, if the center of the coupling pin is offset from the neutral surface of the first side plate inwardly, i.e., toward the stack body, the first side plate is deformed (bent) toward the stack body. Thus, for example, it is possible to effectively reduce the positional displacement or vibrations in the stack body due to the impact outside the stack body.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the center of the coupling pin is offset from the neutral surface of the first side plate outwardly, i.e., in a direction away from the stack body, the first side plate is deformed (bent) in the direction away from the stack body. Therefore, a desired space is formed between the first side plate and the stack body. Thus, it is possible to prevent the first side plate from contacting the stack body unnecessarily. With the simple structure, it is possible to suitably adjust the gap and the state of contact between the first side plate of the casing and the stack body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, the first side plate has the flange for attaching the first side plate to the second side plate. Therefore, no separate coupling member is additionally required. Thus, it is possible to reduce the weight, the number of components, and the cost of the fuel cell stack effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, in the present invention, the casing includes at least one rib-panel. The rigidity of the rib-panel is better than the rigidity of the planar panel. Therefore, even if a load is applied to the casing in a direction different from the stacking direction such as a twisting direction, it is possible to effectively maintain the shape of the casing by the rib, and the casing is not affected by vibrations outside the casing or the like. When the stack body is deformed in a direction that intersects the stacking direction, the amount of displacement in the stack body is reduced effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, by applying a tightening load to the stack body, when a load is applied to the coupling pin in the stacking direction, since the center of the coupling pin is provided on the neutral surface of the rib-panel, it is possible to prevent the force in a bending direction from being applied to the rib-panel. With the lightweight and compact structure, the rigidity of the casing is maintained suitably. It is possible to inhibit the positional displacement in the stack body, and it is possible to reliably apply the desired tightening load to the stack body in the stacking direction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.</p>
