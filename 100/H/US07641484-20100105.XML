<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Herein, the parts corresponding to those of a conventional structure have the same names.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating a connector cover structure according to the present invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are perspective views illustrating operational principles of a connector cover; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>are enlarged views illustrating a process of assembling a female connector and a male connector.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a connector cover structure according to the present invention includes a connector-fixing bracket <b>30</b>, a cover <b>40</b>, and elastic springs <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The connector-fixing bracket <b>30</b> is fixedly assembled with a male connector <b>21</b> (connector), and has assembling holes <b>31</b> formed through opposite sides of the bracket. Herein, according to an assembly structure, a female connector <b>22</b> (mating connector) instead of the male connector <b>21</b> may be assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the assembly of the cover <b>40</b>, a hinge shaft <b>41</b> on opposite sides is rotatably fitted in the assembling holes <b>31</b>. Herein, the cover <b>40</b> is disposed above a connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the male connector <b>21</b>, so as to cover and protect the connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In front of one end of the cover <b>40</b>, a contact part <b>42</b> is protruded by a certain length. Herein, the contact part <b>42</b> has a downward curved shape.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The contact part <b>42</b> of the cover <b>40</b> is disposed on a position where the contact part <b>42</b> can come in contact with a contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of a cassette box <b>14</b>. (The cassette box <b>14</b> mounted from the upper side or the lateral side will be described later.) Accordingly, when the contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the vertically mounted cassette box <b>14</b> presses the contact part <b>42</b> of the cover <b>40</b>, the cover <b>40</b> covering the male connector <b>21</b> rotates in one direction, thereby releasing the connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also, the lower end portion of the contact part <b>42</b> is lower than the center of the hinge shaft <b>41</b> of the cover <b>40</b>, in such a manner that of the contact part <b>42</b> can smoothly downwardly rotate by contact with the contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the laterally mounted cassette box <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, there are stopper pieces <b>33</b> on opposite sides of the cover <b>40</b>, so that the rotating angle of the cover <b>40</b> can be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The elastic springs <b>45</b> (elastic members) are assembled and fixed on the hinge shaft <b>41</b> on opposite sides of the cover <b>40</b>. At the moment when the force pressing the contact part <b>42</b> is released, the cover <b>40</b> is returned to its original position by elastic force of the elastic springs <b>45</b>, thereby again covering the connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the male connector <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, in a connector cover structure according to the present invention as described above, a case where the cassette box <b>14</b> is vertically mounted to a bill storage box <b>12</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, during the process of vertically mounting the cassette box <b>14</b> to the bill storage box <b>12</b>, when the contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the cassette box <b>14</b> presses a contact surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>40</b>, the cover <b>40</b> rotates in one direction on the axis of the hinge shaft <b>41</b>, thereby releasing the covered connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Herein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the male connector <b>21</b> is released, and at the same time, is connected to the female connector <b>22</b> provided on one lateral surface of the vertically mounted cassette box <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, when the cassette box <b>14</b> is upwardly dismounted, the contact part <b>42</b> of the cover <b>40</b>, which has been pressed by the contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the cassette box <b>14</b>, is released. Herein, the cover <b>40</b> is returned to its original position by elastic force of the elastic springs <b>45</b> fixedly assembled on opposite sides of the cover, thereby again covering the connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the male connector <b>21</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the connector from being exposed to dust or foreign substances.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another embodiment of a connector according to the present invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a connector conveyor for upwardly and downwardly conveying a connector; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an exploded perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are side views illustrating a process of assembling a connector.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in a bill storage box <b>12</b>, a cassette box <b>14</b> is configured to be laterally mounted and dismounted. Herein, the mounted cassette box <b>14</b> may clash with a male connector <b>21</b> on the bottom surface of the bill storage box <b>12</b>, and thus cause the breakage of the male connector <b>21</b>. Therefore, in this embodiment, there is provided a connector conveyor <b>50</b> for downwardly conveying the male connector <b>21</b>, thereby preventing the clash.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the connector conveyor <b>50</b> includes an operating lever <b>51</b>, a horizontal conveyor <b>57</b>, fixed brackets <b>58</b>, and a vertical conveyor <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The operating lever <b>51</b> is rotatably assembled to a fixed frame <b>52</b> on the axis of a hinge shaft <b>53</b>. A connecting shaft <b>54</b> is spaced apart from the hinge shaft <b>53</b> by a predetermined distance, and is rotatably assembled with assembling holes <b>57</b><i>a </i>of the horizontal conveyor <b>57</b> through a connecting part <b>55</b> and a connecting shaft <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The horizontal conveyor <b>57</b> has horizontal guide holes <b>57</b><i>b</i>, and inclined guide holes <b>57</b><i>c</i>, on opposite sides.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fixed brackets <b>58</b> are fixedly assembled to the bottom surface of the bill storage box <b>12</b>. The fixed brackets <b>58</b> have assembling holes <b>58</b><i>a </i>and vertical guide holes <b>58</b><i>b </i>perpendicular to the assembling holes <b>58</b><i>a</i>, on opposite sides of the brackets. Herein, connecting shafts <b>60</b> are fitted in the assembling holes <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the fixed brackets <b>58</b> and are slidably inserted in the horizontal guide holes <b>57</b><i>b </i>of the horizontal conveyor <b>57</b>, so as to interconnect the assembling holes <b>58</b><i>a </i>and the horizontal guide holes <b>57</b><i>b </i>while allowing relative sliding between them.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also, between the opposite fixed brackets <b>58</b>, connecting shafts <b>61</b> assembled with the vertical conveyor <b>59</b> are fitted in the vertical guide holes <b>58</b><i>b </i>of the fixed brackets <b>58</b>, and are slidably inserted in the inclined guide holes <b>57</b><i>c </i>of the horizontal conveyor <b>57</b>, so as to interconnect the vertical guide holes <b>58</b><i>b </i>and the inclined guide holes <b>57</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, when the horizontal conveyor <b>57</b> moves in left and right directions, the connecting shafts <b>61</b> inserted in the inclined guide holes <b>57</b><i>c </i>and the vertical guide holes <b>58</b><i>b </i>on the fixed brackets <b>58</b>, can be moved up and down within a predetermined distance. Then, the vertical conveyor <b>59</b> fixedly assembled to the connecting shafts <b>61</b>, and the male connector <b>21</b> are conveyed upward and downward together with the connecting shafts <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, in the connector cover structure provided with the connector conveyor <b>50</b> as described above, when the cassette box <b>14</b> is laterally mounted, the male connector <b>21</b> is conveyed downward by downward operation of the operating lever <b>51</b>, and then the cassette box <b>14</b> is pushed in as deeply as possible. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the clash of the cassette box <b>14</b> with the male connector <b>21</b>. Herein, a contact surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the cassette box <b>14</b> presses a contact surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of a cover <b>40</b>, thereby rotating the cover <b>40</b> in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>, at the moment when a contact part <b>42</b> of the cover <b>40</b> is pressed, a connecting pin <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the male connector <b>21</b> is released. Then, when the operating lever <b>51</b> is upwardly operated, the male connector <b>21</b> is upwardly conveyed by a link structure of the connector conveyor <b>50</b>, and thus is assembled to a female connector <b>22</b> of the cassette box <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, when the operating lever <b>51</b> is downwardly operated, the male connector <b>21</b> is downwardly conveyed, and thus is detached from the female connector <b>22</b>. Herein, the force pressing the contact part <b>42</b> of the cover <b>40</b> is released, so that the cover <b>40</b> can be returned to its original position by elastic force of elastic springs <b>45</b>.</p>
