<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application for BATTERY PACK earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on 9 Sep. 2003 and there duly assigned Ser. No. 2003-0063137.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a battery pack and, more particularly, to a spacer placed between battery cells when making a battery pack.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unlike the primary battery, the secondary battery may be recharged, and may be made into a battery pack and used as the power source for various portable electronic devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, and camcorders.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, the lithium secondary battery among the secondary batteries is more suitable for portable electronic devices since it has a high driving voltage and a high energy density per unit weight. The lithium polymer battery is a type of lithium battery which uses polymer electrolytes, and has the advantage of making portable electronic devices slim and lightweight because it is flexible so as to form various shapes, and its weight is light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, the battery pack includes battery cells which are prepared separately, a case receiving the battery cells, and a spacer placed between the battery cells when a plurality of the battery cells are placed inside the case.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The spacer is placed between the battery cells to prevent electrical contact between the battery cells, and the spacer supports both sides of the battery cell when the battery cells are placed inside the case so that it plays a role in making the battery cells tightly fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The spacer which has been suggested or used for the battery pack up to the present is devised so as to have a contact area with the battery cell which is as large as possible. This enables the spacer to support the battery cells by area contact so that more supporting power is added to the battery cells so as to fix the battery cells more tightly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, by way of example, when the battery cell has a cylindrical shape, the spacer has a curved surface corresponding to the circumferential surface of the battery cells so as to contact the outer surface of the cylindrical battery cell. One example of such a technology is described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-290821.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, such battery packs have a problem in that the life of the battery cell is decreased due to the fact that heat generated by the battery cells disposed inside the case cannot easily flow out of the case. That is, since the conventional battery pack, as described above, has a structure such that the spacer disposed inside the case is in close contact with the battery cells, it has an advantage in terms of support of the battery cells. However, since there is no passage through which the heat generated by the battery cells can flow out of the case, the heat remains inside the case and has a harmful effect on the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the consumer who uses an electronic device having the secondary battery as the power source suffers inconvenience in using the electronic device because it cannot be sufficiently supported by the power source of the secondary battery.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a battery pack in which the heat generated from the battery cells easily flows out of the case, and in which the plurality of battery cells disposed inside the case are supported tightly when the battery pack is made.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one aspect of the present invention, the battery pack includes a case having an inner space, a plurality of battery cells disposed inside the case, and at least one spacer disposed between the battery cells, and a space is formed around a supporting portion of the spacer(s) for the battery cells to allow the heat generated by the battery cells to flow out of the case.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, the battery pack includes a case having an inner space, a plurality of battery cells disposed inside the case, and at least one spacer disposed between the battery cells, wherein the spacer supports the battery cell by line contact with the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The spacer includes a body having a supporting portion for contacting and supporting the battery cells, and the spacer can be formed such that the cross-section of the supporting portion of the spacer is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the battery cell when the spacer is mounted inside the case and has a staircase shape. In that case, the body can be formed in the shape of an H beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a battery pack according to an embodiment of the present invention. The battery pack shown in the figure is a battery pack for laptop computers. However, it is an exemplary embodiment and, accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiment. That is, the present invention can be used as the battery pack for various other electronic devices. Although the battery cell with a cylindrical shape is given below as an example, the present invention is not limited to the following example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in the figure, the battery pack according to the present invention includes a case <b>20</b> having an inner space <b>2</b><i>a </i>of a predetermined size. In the embodiment of the present invention, the case <b>20</b> has an upper case <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a lower case <b>2</b><i>c, </i>both of which are assembled into one body, and the case <b>20</b> receives a plurality of battery cells <b>22</b> inside the inner space <b>2</b><i>a </i>when the upper case <b>2</b><i>b </i>and the lower case <b>2</b><i>c </i>are detached.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The case <b>20</b> has a rectangular shape, and a connector <b>2</b><i>d </i>is formed on one of the upper case <b>2</b><i>b </i>and the lower case <b>2</b><i>c </i>(the lower case for the present embodiment) which electrically connects the battery pack with an electronic device, such as a laptop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The battery cells <b>22</b> are secondary batteries prepared separately, for example, cylindrical lithium-ion secondary batteries, a plurality of which are placed in the inner space <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the case <b>20</b> so as to electrically connect to each other and to connect to the connector <b>2</b><i>d. </i>Since the structure for connecting these battery cells is the same as in the general battery packs, the detailed description for this structure is not provided herewith.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Inside the case <b>20</b>, a spacer <b>24</b> which supports the battery cells <b>22</b> is mechanically placed between the battery cells <b>22</b> so that the battery cells <b>22</b> are mounted stably inside the case <b>20</b>. In addition, the spacer <b>24</b> prevents electrical contact between each other of the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Since the spacer <b>24</b> supports the side corresponding to the longitudinal direction of the battery cells <b>22</b>, that is, the circumferential area of the battery cells <b>22</b>, when the battery cells <b>22</b> are received inside the case <b>20</b>, the spacer <b>24</b> has a body <b>24</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which is formed with a long shape along the longitudinal direction of the battery cells <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, in the present invention, the spacer <b>24</b> has a structure to support the battery cells <b>22</b> by line contact therewith. Accordingly, the body <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the spacer <b>24</b> has the shape of an H beam, and is formed such that the cross-section of a supporting portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>contacts and supports the battery cells having a staircase shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cross-section of the supporting portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>is a cross-sectional view cut in the direction Y perpendicular to the longitudinal direction or longitudinal axis X of the battery cells <b>22</b> when the battery cells <b>22</b> are placed inside the case,</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such a shape enables the spacer <b>24</b> to make a space <b>26</b> between the battery cells <b>22</b> and the supporting portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>as the spacer <b>24</b> supports the battery cells <b>22</b> by line contact therewith inside the case <b>20</b> upon fabrication of the battery pack. The space <b>26</b> is formed with a long shape between the battery cells <b>22</b> and the spacer <b>24</b> along the longitudinal direction of the battery cells <b>22</b> and the spacer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the space <b>26</b> with a predetermined size is formed between the battery cells <b>22</b> and the spacer <b>24</b>, the space <b>26</b> serves as an air flow passage which allows the heat generated by the battery cells <b>22</b> to flow out of the case <b>22</b> when the battery pack is used as a power source for a laptop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">That is, when heat is generated from the reaction of the battery cells, the rising air due to the heat does not remain between the battery cells <b>22</b> and the spacer <b>24</b>, but instead it is guided by the space <b>26</b> to flow out of the case <b>20</b>. Then, it is preferable that a vent hole be formed on the case <b>20</b> to easily drain the air, but this is not shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the meantime, in accordance with the present embodiment, although it is described that the supporting portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the spacer <b>24</b> supports the battery cells <b>22</b> by line contact, the spacer <b>24</b> according to the present invention can also have a structure wherein it supports the battery cells <b>22</b> by point contact as well as line contact.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, in the battery pack of the present invention, the spacer <b>24</b> contacting and supporting the battery cells <b>22</b> provides a space <b>26</b> with respect to the battery cells <b>22</b> while supporting the battery cells <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, when heat is generated by the battery cells <b>22</b>, the battery pack of the present invention allows the heat to flow out of the case <b>20</b> through the space <b>24</b> so as to enable the battery cells <b>22</b> to work without heat damage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, the battery pack of the present invention can prevent the battery from decreasing its life and thereby consumers can use portable electronic devices for a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail hereinabove, it should be clearly understood that many variations and/or modifications of the basic inventive concept herein taught which may appear to those skilled in the art will still fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims.</p>
