<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Statement of the Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns electrical connectors. More particularly, the invention concerns low impedance, low profile battery connectors configured for electrically connecting a battery to at least one circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many battery connectors known in the art for electrically connecting circuits to a battery. Such battery connectors include, but are not limited to, an electrical connector assembly disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,788 to Pristupa, Jr. et al. (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Pristupa&#x201d;). The electrical connector assembly of Pristupa generally comprises an electrical connector configured to be captivated by a radio housing and a battery housing. In this regard, it should be understood that a universal connector is located on the back of the radio for engaging the electrical connector.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The universal connector is comprised of nine (9) electrical contacts having a grid configuration. The electrical contacts extend away from the radio housing. Four (4) protruding members are also located on the back of the radio housing. The protruding members facilitate an alignment of the electrical connector and the universal connector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electrical connector is comprised of an interface section having a plurality of pads formed thereon. Each of the pads is configured to engage one of the electrical contacts of the universal connector. The electrical connector is also comprised of a plurality of apertures formed therein. The apertures facilitate the captivation of the electrical connector by the radio housing. As such, the apertures are sized and shaped to receive the protruding members of the universal connector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The electrical connector assembly of Pristupa suffers from certain drawbacks. For example, the electrical connector assembly has a relatively large profile. The electrical connector assembly has a relatively complicated assembly. Accordingly, there is a need for an electrical connector having a low profile and easy assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention concerns a low impedance, low-profile connector. The connector comprises a dielectric body comprising two opposing faces, pins, a plate, and resilient spring fingers. Each pin is formed of a conductive material captured within the dielectric body. Each pin extends through the dielectric body. Each pin is defined by a pair of nubs. The nubs respectively extend from each of the two opposing faces. Each nub is movable along an axis aligned with an elongated length of the pin. Each nub is resiliently biased in a direction away from the two opposing faces.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plate is formed of a planar conductive material. The plate is secured to the dielectric body adjacent to a first face of the two opposing faces. The plate comprises one or more apertures through which the pins extend in a first direction. One or more of the apertures is sized and shaped to form an electrical connection between the plate and selected ones of the pins. The selected pins can be ground pins having a longer length as compared to a remainder of the pins. The resilient spring fingers comprise projections formed on a periphery of the plate. Each of the resilient spring fingers extends away from the dielectric body in a direction between a plane defined by the first face and the first direction of the pins. Notably, an end of the resilient spring fingers distal from the dielectric body is approximately aligned with an end of the nubs distal from the dielectric body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the invention, retention fingers are formed as projections on a periphery of the plate. Each of the retention fingers is shaped to define a resilient clip configured for engaging a portion of the dielectric body. For example, the resilient spring fingers have an S-shaped profile. The portion of the dielectric body is a ridge defined on a peripheral portion of the dielectric body adjacent to the first face of the two opposing faces. Retainers are formed of tab-like projections defined on a periphery of the plate. The retainers extend beyond a peripheral edge of the dielectric body. The retainers are configured for securing the connector to a chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, the dielectric body is comprised of at least one sidewall extending from the first face to a second opposing face. At least one gasket is provided on the sidewall. The gasket is configured for forming a seal which prevents the intrusion of environmental contaminants around a periphery of the connector when the connector is installed in a chassis. The dielectric body is further comprised of an alignment key structure. The alignment key structure is configured for selectively limiting an installed position of the connector within the chassis in which it is to be installed.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The retainers <b>1004</b> are configured to facilitate the retention of the electrical connector <b>200</b> within the aperture (or bored hole) <b>208</b> of the communication device <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The retainers <b>1004</b> are also configured to secure the electrical connector <b>200</b> to a chassis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the retainers <b>1004</b> are formed as tab-like projections protruding away from a periphery of the plate <b>800</b>. The retainers <b>1004</b> are defined by a periphery of the plate <b>800</b>. The retainers <b>1004</b> are sized and shaped to extend beyond a peripheral edge of the dielectric body <b>404</b>. The retainers <b>1004</b> are radially spaced apart along a periphery of the plate <b>800</b>. For example, the retainers <b>1004</b> are respectively located along a periphery of the plate <b>800</b> at zero degrees (0&#xb0;), forty-five degrees (45&#xb0;), or ninety-degrees (90&#xb0;) from an axis <b>1020</b>. The invention is not limited in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the retainers <b>1004</b> have a substantially rectangular shape with round corners. The invention is not limited in this regard. The retainers <b>1004</b> can have any shape selected in accordance with a particular electrical connector <b>200</b> application. It should be noted that the retainers <b>1004</b> are provided to facilitate an electrical connection between at least one electrically conductive pin (e.g., electrically conductive pins <b>302</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>302</b><sub>4</sub>) and a chassis for grounding the same.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are provided to account for tolerance variations between the sizes of the dielectric body <b>404</b> and printed circuit boards <b>300</b> (described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are configured to facilitate the retention of the electrical connector <b>200</b> within the aperture (or bored hole) <b>208</b> of the communication device <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As such, the resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are protruding structures formed on a periphery of the plate <b>800</b>. Each resilient spring finger <b>1006</b> is sized and shaped so as to extend away from a plane defined by a surface (or face) <b>604</b> of the dielectric body <b>404</b> when the plate <b>800</b> is coupled thereto. Each resilient spring finger <b>1006</b> has an end <b>1050</b> distal from the dielectric body <b>404</b> when the plate <b>800</b> is coupled thereto. These distal ends <b>1050</b> can be placed along the periphery of the plate <b>800</b> so as to be approximately aligned with the nubs <b>510</b> of the electrically conductive pins <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> have a substantially S-shaped profile. The invention is not limited in this regard. The resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> can have any shape selected in accordance with a particular electrical connector <b>200</b> application. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are radially spaced apart along a periphery of the plate <b>800</b>. For example, the resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are respectively located along a periphery of the plate <b>800</b> at zero degrees (0&#xb0;) or ninety-degrees (90&#xb0;) from an axis <b>1022</b>. The invention is not limited in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be understood that the resilient spring fingers <b>1006</b> are also configured to provide a mechanical connection between at least one electrically conductive pin (e.g., electrically conductive pins <b>302</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>302</b><sub>4</sub>) and a chassis (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result of the mechanical connection, an electrically conductive pad for a ground signal of a circuit (not shown) can be connected to a chassis (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This mechanical connection ensures low connection impedance between the communication device <b>100</b> and a power source (e.g., battery <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). One can appreciate that the low impedance connection reduces radiated emissions from the power source (e.g., battery <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), thereby increasing a clarity of a signal received at or transmitted from the communication device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the dielectric body <b>404</b> comprises slots <b>1008</b> and ridges <b>1010</b> defined on a peripheral portion thereof adjacent to a surface (or face) <b>604</b>. The slots <b>1008</b> facilitate the engagement between the retention fingers <b>1002</b> of the plate <b>800</b> and the dielectric body <b>404</b>. As such, the slots <b>1008</b> are sized and shaped to receive at least a portion of the retention fingers <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The slots <b>1008</b> and ridges <b>1010</b> ensure that the plate <b>800</b> is placed in a proper orientation when coupled to the dielectric body <b>404</b>. The slots <b>1008</b> and ridges <b>1010</b> further ensure that the plate <b>800</b> remains in a selected or optimal position in relation to the dielectric body <b>404</b>. Stated differently, the slots <b>1008</b> and ridges <b>1010</b> collectively provide a means for preventing the plate <b>800</b> from rotating or spinning when coupled to the dielectric body <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">All of the apparatus, methods, and algorithms disclosed and claimed herein can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure. While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that variations may be applied to the apparatus, methods and sequence of steps of the method without departing from the concept, spirit and scope of the invention.
