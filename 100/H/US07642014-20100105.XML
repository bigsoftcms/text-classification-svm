<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-087038, filed Mar. 26, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a positive electrode active material and to a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery equipped with a positive electrode containing the positive electrode active material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, a portable information terminal has been developed and being propagated rapidly. With propagation of the portable information terminal, a research and development of a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery used as a power source of the portable information terminal is being carried out vigorously so as to put the secondary battery to the practical use. Known is a lithium ion secondary battery, which is an example of the nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery, comprising a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator arranged between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, and a liquid nonaqueous electrolyte impregnated in the separator. The lithium ion secondary battery, which has been put to the practical use, has a discharge voltage of about 4V.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, the development of a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery exhibiting a discharge voltage higher than 4V has already been started. A nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery comprising LiCOPO<sub>4 </sub>or LiNiPO<sub>4 </sub>as the positive electrode active material is known to exhibit a high discharge voltage of about 5V.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The theoretical discharge capacity, which is obtained when a lithium ion is inserted into and extracted from the active material, is about 170 mAh/g in each of LiCOPO<sub>4 </sub>and LiNiPO<sub>4</sub>. However, the discharge capacity that is actually obtained is about half the theoretical discharge capacity noted above. In addition, each of LiCOPO<sub>4 </sub>and LiNiPO<sub>4 </sub>is defective in that the diffusion rate of the lithium ions within the crystal is low, with the result that, if the charge-discharge is carried out with a high current density, it is impossible to obtain a large discharge capacity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">&#x3c;First Positive Electrode Active Material&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first electrode active material contains a lithium-containing composite metal oxide having a composition represented by formula (1) given below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>LiMg<sub>x</sub>M<sub>1&#x2212;x</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">where M is at least one kind of an element selected from the group consisting of Co and Ni, and the molar ratio x is larger than 0.5 and smaller than 0.75, i.e., 0.5&#x3c;x&#x3c;0.75.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(Element M)</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The transition metal element M is absolutely necessary for bringing about a lithium absorption-desorption reaction. In order to obtain a high operating voltage in the nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery, it is desirable for at least one of Ni and Co to be used as the element M.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(Mg)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present invention, the molar ratio x of Mg is defined to be larger than 0.5 and smaller than 0.75. If the molar ratio x is 0.5 or less, the lithium diffusion rate within the positive electrode active material is lowered, with the result that it is difficult to obtain a large discharge capacity when the secondary battery is discharged with a large current. In other words, the discharge rate characteristics are lowered. On the other hand, if the molar ratio x is 0.75 or more, the discharge capacity of the nonaqueous secondary battery is lowered. It is more desirable for the molar ratio x to be not smaller than 0.52 and to be smaller than 0.75, and furthermore desirably to be not smaller than 0.54 and to be smaller than 0.75.</p>

However, if the molar ratio of lithium is not smaller than 1.3, the probability for the excessive lithium ions to impair the diffusion of the lithium ions is increased, with the result that it is possible for the lithium diffusion rate within the positive electrode active material to be lowered. It follows that the molar ratio y should be larger than 0 and not larger than 0.3.

However, if the molar ratio z exceeds 0.5, the amount of the transition metal element M contained in the complex metal oxide is decreased so as to decrease the discharge capacity of the nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery. Under the circumstances, the molar ratio z should be larger than 0 and should not exceed 0.5. In this case, it is possible to make excellent both the discharge capacity and the discharge rate characteristics of the nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery.
