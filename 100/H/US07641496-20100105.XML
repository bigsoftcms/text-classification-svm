<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a zero insertion force (ZIF) electrical connector, and more particularly, to a socket connector having an improved guiding device arranged between a base and a cover so as to efficiently drive the cover to move along the base.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,926 issued to Chen on Aug. 26, 2003 discloses a socket connector for connecting an IC package, such as a CPU to a printed circuit board (PCB). The socket connector <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an insulating base <b>20</b>, a plurality of terminals <b>28</b> arranged in the base <b>20</b>, a cover <b>22</b> movably assembled on the base <b>20</b>, an anti-rotation mechanism <b>24</b> and an actuator <b>26</b>. The actuator <b>26</b> drives the cover <b>22</b> to slide on the insulating base <b>20</b>. The anti-rotation mechanism <b>24</b> includes a generally T-shaped metal cover plate <b>241</b> and a metal base plate <b>242</b> defining a through hole <b>2421</b> therein. The cover plate <b>241</b> is integrally insert-molded with the cover <b>22</b>, the base plate <b>242</b> is disposed in the recess <b>201</b> of the base <b>20</b>. When the socket connector <b>2</b> is assembled, the actuator <b>26</b> is rotated to drive the cover <b>22</b> to slide along the base <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the actuator <b>26</b> is driven to rotate, it firstly needs to overcome a great deal of friction force resulted from the coarse inner surface of the through hole <b>2421</b>. Therefore, the user needs to exert a comparable higher driving force to rotate the actuator <b>26</b> so as to drive the cover <b>22</b> to move along the base <b>20</b>. Hence, a new design which can reduce operating force is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a socket connector that can overcome the above-mentioned problem.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the object set forth, a socket connector of the present invention includes an insulative base defining a plurality of passageways to receive a plurality of conductive terminals therein, a base plate retained in the insulative base, a cover movably assembled on the base, a cover plate retained in the cover and a cylindrical actuator. The base defines a through hole thereof. The base plate defines a through hole and a guiding slot. The cover defines a plurality of passages corresponding to the passageways of the insulative base and a through hole. The cover plate defines a through hole and a guiding portion sliding in the guiding slot. The cylindrical actuator is received and rotating in said through holes. At least one inner edge of the through hole of the base plate extends outwards to form an edge portion with a smooth surface thereon.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe a preferred embodiment of the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a ZIF socket connector in accordance with the present invention is adapted for electrically connecting an IC package, such as a CPU to a PCB (not shown). The socket connector <b>1</b> includes an insulative base <b>10</b> mounted with a plurality of terminals <b>19</b> thereon, a cover <b>12</b> movably assembled on the base <b>10</b>, a guiding mechanism <b>14</b> locating between the base <b>10</b> and the cover <b>12</b> and an actuator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The base <b>10</b> is generally rectangular. A plurality of passageways <b>101</b> is defined in the base <b>10</b>. The plurality of passageways <b>101</b> form a rectangular array, and the plurality of conductive terminals <b>19</b> are received in the passageways <b>101</b>. A first recess <b>102</b> of cross-shape is defined in a middle portion of one end of the base <b>10</b>. An elliptical through hole <b>1021</b> runs through the first recess <b>102</b> along upright direction, for receiving the actuator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cover <b>12</b> defines a square opening <b>121</b> in a centre portion thereof, and a ledge portion <b>122</b> at one end thereof. A through hole <b>123</b> is defined in a middle portion of the ledge portion <b>122</b>, corresponding to the through hole <b>1021</b> of the base <b>10</b>. The through hole <b>123</b> is formed by two semicircular inner edges of different radius. Accordingly, a pair of spaced stop edges <b>1231</b> is formed at the inner side of through hole <b>123</b>. A plurality of passages <b>124</b> is defined in the cover <b>12</b>, corresponding to the passageways <b>101</b> of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The guiding mechanism <b>14</b> includes a generally T-shaped metal cover plate <b>141</b> and a metal base plate <b>142</b>. The cover plate <b>141</b> defines a circular through hole <b>1411</b> in a middle portion thereof and a pair of stop portions <b>1412</b> extending upwardly and adjacent to the through hole <b>1411</b>. The stop portions <b>1412</b> are chamfered at the inner side to correspond to a proximate curvature of the through hole <b>1411</b>. The cover plate <b>141</b> further defines a pair of small fixing holes <b>1414</b> in opposite ends thereof for facilitating insert-molding of the cover plate <b>141</b> in a second recess (not shown) of the cover and a guiding portion <b>1413</b> extending downwards from a bottom thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the base plate <b>142</b> defines a rectangular through hole <b>1421</b> in a middle portion thereof and a guiding slot <b>1422</b> at one side thereof and perpendicular to the through hole <b>1421</b>, corresponding to the guiding portion <b>1413</b>. A back inner edge opposite to the guiding slot <b>1422</b> of the through hole <b>1421</b> further extends upwardly and then backwardly to form an edge portion with thereon a smooth surface <b>1423</b> downwardly bent from a primary horizontal plane (not labeled) of the base plate, which is parallel to the base <b>10</b>. The edge portion extends out of the through hole <b>1421</b> and the smooth surface <b>1423</b> is provided to contact with the actuator <b>16</b>. The cover plate <b>141</b> is insert-molded in the cover <b>12</b>, and the base plate <b>142</b> is retained in the first recess <b>102</b> of the base <b>10</b> with a pair of retaining portion <b>1424</b> retained in corresponding retaining slots <b>1022</b>. The stop portions <b>1412</b> abut against the stop edges <b>1231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The actuator <b>16</b> defines several cylindrical portions of different radius stacked one on another. The cylindrical portions progressively decrease in diameter from top to bottom. Center axes of the different cylindrical portions are offset from each other. A lateral protrusion <b>161</b> protrudes from a circumferential periphery of the topmost cylindrical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The actuator <b>16</b> is received in corresponding through holes <b>123</b>, <b>1411</b>, <b>1421</b> and <b>1021</b>. The bottom end of the actuator <b>16</b> protrudes beyond the base portion <b>10</b> and is riveted with a pad <b>18</b> to secure the actuator <b>16</b> in the socket connector <b>1</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Rotation of the protrusion <b>161</b> is restricted between the two stop portions <b>1412</b>. Thus a distance along which the cover <b>12</b> slide is limited. The actuator <b>16</b> is rotated by an exterior force to urge the cover plate <b>141</b> to move in a front-to-rear direction by the limitation of the guiding slot <b>1422</b>. Then, the cover <b>12</b> together with the cover plate <b>141</b> is urged to move in the front-to-rear direction. The cylindrical portions of the actuator <b>16</b> will rotate in corresponding through holes, wherein friction is produced between the cylindrical portion and the inner side of the through hole <b>1421</b>. The smooth surface <b>1423</b> is smooth so that the coefficient of friction between the cylindrical portion and the smooth surface <b>1423</b> is reduced, and the friction may be reduced effectively. This ensures that the operating of the actuator <b>16</b> is easy and the cover <b>12</b> slides along the base <b>10</b> safely. The bend of the edge portion can enhance the rigidity of the edge portion, and also can prevent burrs from being produced while the through hole <b>1421</b> is pressed in the base plate <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
