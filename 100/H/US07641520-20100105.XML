No. 60/605,190, filed Aug. 27, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a connector assembly and more particularly to a flexible connector assembly for an implantable wiring harness. However, it is to be appreciated that the present invention is also amenable to other like environments and applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The need for implantable mechanical assist or replacement organs and devices is growing at a fast pace that challenges the ability of the medical industry to develop, test, and commercialize suitable products. While innovative advances in materials, electronics, and technology propel this industry forward, the reliance on conventional approaches to the implantable wiring harnesses that connect these many devices together presents serious obstacles to reliability and implantability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Implanted wiring harnesses are subjected to a spectrum of forces and environmental stresses that must be withstood throughout the lifetime of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, as the sophistication and complexity of implanted medical devices increases, there is a corresponding increase in the number of separate power and control channels required in the wiring harness. These wiring harnesses must provide a safe and reliable conduit for electrical power, control signals, and feedback signals to and from power sources, control modules, sensors, and the necessary medical devices. In addition, they must be biocompatible, extremely reliable, easy to install and to replace, and they must be of small enough volume and flexible so as to not detract from patient comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional implantable wiring harness technology relies upon plastic-insulated metallic conductors cabled within a medical grade plastic jacket for the primary conduit. Interconnects are either hardwired at sealed devices (fixed and non-removable) or rely upon conventional connector approaches. These approaches have been adapted from other industries&#x2014;essentially round rigid bodies with cylindrical coplanar pin and socket inserts packaged in bulky sealed enclosures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Until recently, very few electrical devices were designed for long term implantation inside the human body. The classic example of implanted wiring is the pacemaker lead. This was once a very troublesome component, although the field has now progressed to a very high degree of reliability. While highly flexed, this application has some advantages. Generally, one lead wire has been involved, with current return through the body to the case of the pulse generator. Most advantageously, the current levels are extremely low, and exotic alloys can be used to construct the lead. These can be very strong and corrosion resistant, but of relatively high resistance. This resistance is insignificant to a pacemaker pulse, but is not as desired to a significant current carrying lead, such as occurs in implanted blood pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a new and improved connector assembly for implanted medical devices which overcomes difficulties with the prior art while providing better and more advantageous overall results.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A preferred linear connector assembly comprises a plug connector and a receptacle connector. The plug connector includes an elongated member and an electrical contact disposed about a portion of the elongated member. The receptacle connector includes a wall defining a cavity dimensioned to sealingly receive the elongated member and an electrical contact having a surface disposed in the wall for electrical connection with the plug contact. The electrical contacts of the plug connector and the receptacle connector have spherical surface portions whereby a spherical interface between the electrical contacts is formed upon make-up and reduces voltage drops between the contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The elongated connector body includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced apart first electrical contacts fixedly secured to a peripheral surface of the elongated connector body. A plurality of longitudinally spaced apart second electrical contacts extend from the receptacle connector wall and at least partially surround the cavity. The plurality of second contacts are received electrically connected to the plurality of first contacts when the plug connector is received in the receptacle connector. Upon insertion of the elongated connector body into the cavity, the peripheral surface of the elongated connector body located between adjacent first contacts sealingly engages the wall to electrically isolate adjacent first contacts from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The elongated plug connector includes a bore for receiving a first set of power and sensor cables. A plurality of spaced apart first electrical contacts are received in the bore, wherein the first set of power and sensor cables are electrically connected to the plurality of first electrical contacts. A plurality of second electrical contacts in the receptacle connector are received electrically connected to the plurality of first contacts upon assembly of the plug connector to the receptacle connector. A second set of power and sensor cables are electrically connected to the plurality of second electrical contacts. The second set of receptacle power and sensor cables are helically coiled about the cavity for flexibility and for relieving strain from solder joints between each second cable and each second electrical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A benefit of the present invention resides in the ability to provide a totally flexible system of minimal volume that can provide the required reliability and implantability to maximize patient quality of life.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another benefit of the present invention resides in the ability to provide electrical contacts which are relatively large, for good conduction, and sealed from one another, as a second barrier to shorting by fluid or corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet another benefit of the present invention resides in the ability to provide a connector assembly having minimized dimensions to ease implantability and improve patient comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still other non-limiting benefits and aspects of the invention will become apparent from a reading and understanding of the description of the preferred embodiments below.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should, of course, be understood that the description and drawings herein are merely illustrative and that various modifications and changes can be made in the structures disclosed without departing from the spirit of the invention. Like numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a generally linear flexible connector assembly <b>20</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention comprises a plug connector <b>22</b> and a receptacle connector <b>24</b>. Both the plug connector and receptacle connector are formed at least partially from a flexible elastomeric material, preferably a medical grade elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The plug connector <b>22</b> includes an elongated member <b>26</b> and at least one electrical contact. In this embodiment, the plug connector includes five longitudinally spaced apart electrical contacts <b>28</b> disposed about a portion of the elongated member; however, it should be appreciated that the plug connector <b>22</b> can include more or less than five electrical contacts depending on the manner and use of the connector assembly <b>20</b>. Each electrical contact <b>28</b> is fixedly secured to a peripheral surface <b>30</b> of the elongated member and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are generally circular in the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the plug connector <b>22</b> further includes a first or proximal seal <b>32</b> and a second or distal seal <b>34</b> axially spaced therefrom. The proximal seal is fixedly secured to a proximal portion <b>38</b> of the elongated member <b>26</b> and the distal seal distal is fixedly secured to a distal portion <b>40</b> of the elongated member. As will be described in greater detail below, the proximal seal <b>32</b> expels any fluid or air in a cavity <b>44</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b> upon advancement of the plug connector <b>22</b> into the receptacle connector. The distal seal <b>34</b> provides protection from fluid ingress and/or migration at tissue interfaces. In this embodiment, the proximal and distal seals are shown as a pair of adjacent seals having O-ring conformations. It will be appreciated that other contours of the proximal and distal seals <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the proximal seal <b>32</b> and the distal seal <b>34</b> can be integrally formed with the elongated member <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Adjacent the distal portion of the elongated member <b>26</b> is a tapered strain relief <b>50</b> which adds flexibility to the plug connector <b>22</b>. The strain relief also sealingly secures the plug connector to a first cable/cord jacket <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In this embodiment, the strain relief is molded to the jacket, although, the jacket may be secured thereto with any other type of bonding. Disposed on a peripheral surface <b>54</b> of the strain relief is a gripping means <b>56</b> generally comprised of a plurality of axially-spaced, circumferentially extending ridges which allows for easy handling of the plug connector <b>22</b> and provides a user with a suitable gripping surface for make-up and disconnection of the connector assembly. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plug connector <b>22</b> includes a bore <b>60</b> for receiving a first set of power and signal/sensor cables <b>62</b> extending from an end of a cord <b>64</b>. Each power and signal/sensor cable is electrically connected to one of the electrical contacts <b>28</b>. The power and signal/sensor cables <b>62</b> extend longitudinally through the elongated member <b>26</b>, the elastomeric material of the elongated member at least partially encapsulating the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the receptacle connector <b>24</b> includes a wall <b>70</b> defining the cavity <b>44</b> which, as stated above, is dimensioned to sealingly receive the elongated member <b>26</b>. The receptacle connector further includes at least one electrical contact having a surface disposed in the wall <b>70</b> for electrical connection with at least one of the electrical contacts <b>28</b> of the plug connector. Preferably, the receptacle connector will have the same number of electrical contacts as the plug connector <b>22</b> and, in this embodiment, the receptacle connector has five longitudinally spaced apart electrical contacts <b>72</b> extending from the wall <b>70</b> and at least partially surrounding the cavity <b>44</b>. Of course, one skilled in the art will appreciate that a different number of contacts may be used without departing from the scope and intent of the present invention. The electrical contacts <b>72</b> are electrically connected to the electrical contacts <b>28</b> (through physical engagement) when the plug connector <b>22</b> is received in the receptacle connector <b>24</b>. As previously stated, the receptacle connector <b>24</b> is formed at least partially from a flexible elastomeric material which at least partially encapsulates the electrical contacts <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To promote flexibility of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, and ease of make-up and disconnection of the connector assembly, the electrical contacts <b>72</b> are split rings (i.e. generally semi-circular) to permit expansion during the insertion and removal of the plug connector <b>22</b> into and out of the cavity <b>44</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>. Moreover, the electrical contacts <b>28</b>, <b>72</b> of the plug connector and the receptacle connector have spherical surface portions whereby a spherical interface between the electrical contacts <b>28</b>, <b>72</b> is formed upon make-up (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)). This spherical interface allows slight relative articulation between the electrical contacts which may result from flexure of the mated plug connector <b>22</b> and receptacle connector <b>24</b> while still maintaining a maximum of surface contact thereby reducing voltage drops between the electrical contacts. As perhaps best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, because the cavity <b>44</b> is dimensioned to matingly receive the plug connector <b>22</b>, upon insertion of the elongated member <b>26</b> into the cavity, the peripheral surface <b>30</b> of the elongated member located between adjacent electrical contacts <b>28</b> sealingly engages the wall <b>70</b> to electrically isolate the adjacent electrical contacts from each other. It will also be appreciated that adjacent electrical contacts can be isolated from each other by a separate seal(s) (not shown) in the elongated member <b>26</b> between the adjacent electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the receptacle connector <b>24</b> further includes a fluid exhaust port <b>78</b> in fluid communication with the cavity <b>44</b>. As indicated above, the proximal and distal seals <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and the peripheral surface seal between adjacent electrical contacts <b>28</b> remove fluid or debris from the cavity and provide protection from fluid ingress and/or migration. As the elongated member <b>26</b> of the plug connector <b>22</b> is being inserted into the cavity <b>44</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, the proximal seal <b>32</b> prevents and removes debris entrapment in the cavity by wiping the wall <b>70</b> defining the cavity. This, in turn, flushes any contaminants from the cavity through the exhaust port <b>78</b> prior to engagement of the electrical contacts <b>28</b> and <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similar to the plug connector <b>22</b>, and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the receptacle connector <b>24</b> also includes a tapered strain relief <b>80</b>. Again, the strain relief also adds flexibility to the receptacle connector and sealingly secures the receptacle connector to a second cable/cord jacket <b>82</b>. Disposed on a peripheral surface <b>84</b> of the receptacle connector is a gripping means <b>86</b> generally comprised of a plurality of circumferentially extending ridges which allows for easy handling or manipulating of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, particularly during assembly and disassembly of the connector arrangement. The receptacle connector <b>24</b> includes a bore <b>90</b> for receiving a second set of power and signal/sensor cables <b>92</b> extending from an end of a cord <b>94</b>. Each power and signal/sensor cable is electrically connected to one of the electrical contacts <b>72</b>. The power and signal/sensor cables <b>92</b> extend longitudinally through the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, the elastomeric material of the receptacle connector at least partially encapsulating the cables. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second set of power and signal/sensor cables <b>92</b> are preferably helically coiled about the cavity <b>44</b> for flexibility and for relieving strain from solder joints between each cable and each receptacle contact <b>72</b>. As will be appreciated, the helical portions of the cable will selectively uncoil and coil in response to forces imposed and released, respectively, on the connectors during make-up and disconnection. This reduces the probability that these forces are transferred to the solder joints that provide the important electrical connection between the individual cables and respective receptacle contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, the connector assembly <b>20</b> is an in-line 5-channel flexible linear interconnect wherein each cord <b>64</b> and <b>94</b> has three power cables and two signal/sensor cables and is jacketed in a medical grade elastomeric material. The outer jackets <b>52</b> and <b>82</b> of the cords <b>64</b> and <b>94</b>, respectively, are preferably an aliphatic polycarbonate-based polyurethane, for example sold under the trademark Carbothane&#xae; manufactured by Thermedics Polymer Products; although, it will be appreciated that other suitable elastomeric materials can be used for the jackets.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The receptacle connector <b>24</b> further includes a shaping member <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) extending therethrough which maintains a desired conformation of the connector assembly <b>20</b>. The shaping member <b>102</b>, which can be a bendable wire, provides the user with the ability to permanently shape the connector assembly depending on its end use. For example, bore <b>100</b> extends through the receptacle connector <b>24</b> for receiving the shaping member <b>102</b>. Thus, the shaping member is easily inserted and removed if desired; although, it will be appreciated that the shaping member can be molded to or encapsulated by the elastomeric material of the receptacle connector.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To connect the plug connector <b>22</b> to the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, an end of the proximal portion <b>38</b> of the elongated member <b>26</b>, which has a cone-like contour or tapered nose for ease of insertion and guiding receipt into the cavity <b>44</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>, includes a through hole <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). An end of a suture line (not shown) may be threaded through the hole <b>104</b> and knotted. An opposing end of the suture line is then threaded through the cavity <b>44</b> and the fluid exhaust port <b>78</b>. As the suture line is pulled through the exhaust port, the cone-like end of the elongated member <b>26</b> enters the cavity <b>44</b>. As the user continues to pull the suture line, the proximal seal <b>32</b> expels any fluid, air or debris in a cavity <b>44</b> out of the exhaust port <b>78</b> upon advancement of the plug connector <b>22</b> into the receptacle connector <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, once the elongated member <b>26</b> is fully inserted in the cavity <b>44</b>, electrical contacts <b>28</b> are connected to electrical contacts <b>72</b> and the peripheral surface <b>30</b> of the elongated member located between adjacent electrical contacts <b>28</b> sealingly engages the wall <b>70</b> defining the cavity <b>44</b> to electrically isolate the adjacent electrical contacts from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the connector assembly <b>20</b> further includes a locking means for securing the plug connector to the receptacle connector. Specifically, the plug connector <b>22</b> includes a pair of diametrically opposed tabs <b>106</b> extending axially from an end of the strain relief <b>50</b> adjacent the distal seal <b>34</b>. A proximal portion <b>108</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b> includes a slot <b>110</b> dimensioned to receive the tabs <b>106</b>. The tabs have apertures <b>112</b> which register with apertures <b>114</b> extending through the proximal portions <b>108</b> such that a separate suture line (not shown) when threaded through the apertures secures the tabs in the slot. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, once secured, the tabs <b>106</b> fully engage in the slot <b>110</b> which verifies correct assembly and the peripheral surface <b>54</b> of the strain relief <b>50</b> is contiguous with a peripheral surface <b>118</b> of the proximal portion <b>108</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that the connector assembly <b>20</b> can include alternative locking means for securing the plug connector to the receptacle connector such as a twist lock, keyways and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Similar to the aforementioned embodiment, a second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-13</figref> Since most of the structure and function is substantially identical, reference numerals with a single primed suffix (&#x2032;) refer to like components (e.g., plug connector is referred to by reference numeral <b>22</b>&#x2032;), and new numerals identify new components in the additional embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a typical wiring harness <b>150</b> includes a hard-wired battery <b>152</b>, an electronic control unit <b>154</b> with a multiple bulkhead, and an actuator <b>156</b> with a bulkhead. A first cable or cord <b>158</b> interconnects the battery and the electronic control unit and a second cable or cord <b>160</b> interconnects the actuator and the electronic control unit. A connector assembly <b>20</b>&#x2032; separates the second cable into first and second sections <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the connector assembly <b>20</b>&#x2032; includes a plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; and a receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032;. Similar to the first embodiment, both the plug connector and receptacle connector are formed at least partially from a flexible elastomeric material, preferably a medical grade elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; includes an elongated member <b>170</b> and a plurality of linearly stacked, spaced apart electrical ring contacts <b>172</b> fixedly secured to a peripheral surface <b>174</b> of the elongated member. The plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; further includes a proximal seal <b>32</b>&#x2032; and a distal seal <b>34</b>&#x2032; axially spaced therefrom, both seals being fixedly secured to the elongated member <b>170</b>. The proximal seal <b>32</b>&#x2032; expels any fluid or air in a cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; upon advancement of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; into the receptacle connector in a manner as described above. The distal seal <b>34</b>&#x2032; provides protection from fluid ingress and/or migration. In this embodiment, the proximal and distal seals are again shown as a pair of adjacent seals having O-ring conformations.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Adjacent the elongated member <b>170</b> is a tapered strain relief <b>50</b>&#x2032;. The strain relief sealingly secures the plug connector to the first section <b>162</b> of cable/cord <b>160</b> and adds flexibility to the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;. The strain relief includes a gripping means <b>56</b>&#x2032; generally comprised of a plurality of ridges which allows for easy handling of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;. Although not illustrated, a first set of power and signal/sensor cables extending from an end of the first section <b>162</b> is electrically connected to the plurality of electrical contacts <b>172</b>. The power and signal/sensor cables extend longitudinally through the elongated member <b>170</b>, the elastomeric material of the elongated member encapsulating the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>, the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; includes the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; which, as stated above, is dimensioned to sealingly receive the elongated member <b>170</b> and a plurality of electrical contacts (not shown) having a surface disposed in a wall (not shown) of the cavity for electrical connection with the plurality of electrical contacts <b>172</b> of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; when the plug connector is received in the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032;. As previously stated, the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; is formed at least partially from a flexible elastomeric material which at least partially encapsulates the electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To promote flexibility of the receptacle, and similar to the previous embodiment, the electrical contacts of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; are generally semi-circular to permit expansion during the insertion and removal of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; into and out of the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032;. Because the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; is dimensioned to matingly receive the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;, upon insertion of the elongated member <b>170</b> into the cavity, the peripheral surface <b>174</b> of the elongated member located between adjacent electrical contacts <b>172</b> sealingly engages the cavity wall to electrically isolate the adjacent electrical contacts from each other. It will also be appreciated that adjacent electrical contacts can be isolated from each other by a separate integral seal(s) (not shown) formed with the elongated member <b>170</b> between the adjacent electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>, the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; further includes a fluid exhaust port <b>78</b>&#x2032; in fluid communication with the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032;. As indicated above, the integrally molded proximal and distal seals <b>32</b>&#x2032; and <b>34</b>&#x2032; and the peripheral surface seal between adjacent electrical contacts <b>172</b> remove debris and fluid from the cavity and provide protection from fluid ingress and/or migration. As the elongated member <b>170</b> of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; is inserted into the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032;, the proximal seals <b>32</b>&#x2032; prevent debris entrapment in the cavity by wiping the cavity wall, which, in turn, flushes any contaminants from the cavity through the exhaust port <b>78</b>&#x2032; prior to engagement of the electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Similar to the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;, the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; also includes a tapered strain relief <b>80</b>&#x2032;. Again, the strain relief adds flexibility to the receptacle connector and sealingly secures the receptacle connector to the second section <b>164</b> of second cable/cord <b>160</b>. Disposed on a peripheral surface <b>184</b> of the receptacle connector is a gripping means <b>186</b> generally comprised of molded-in ridges which aid handling of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; while wet. The receptacle connector includes a second set of power and signal/sensor cables (not shown) extending from an end of the second section <b>164</b> of second cable/cord <b>160</b>. Each power and signal/sensor cable is electrically connected to one of the electrical contacts partially disposed in the cavity wall. The second set of power and signal/sensor cables extend longitudinally through the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032;, the elastomeric material of the receptacle connector at least partially encapsulating the cables. Similar to the first embodiment, the second set of power and signal/sensor cables are helically coiled about the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; for flexibility and for relieving strain from solder joints between each cable and each receptacle contact.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, to assemble the connector assembly <b>20</b>&#x2032;, an end <b>190</b> of the elongated member <b>170</b> includes a through hole <b>194</b>. An end of a suture line <b>196</b> is threaded through the hole <b>194</b> and knotted. An opposing end of the suture line is then threaded through the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; and the fluid exhaust port <b>78</b>&#x2032;. As the suture line <b>196</b> is pulled through the exhaust port, the end <b>190</b> of the elongated member <b>170</b> enters the cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032;. As the user continues to pull the suture line, the proximal seal <b>32</b>&#x2032; expels any fluid or air in a cavity <b>44</b>&#x2032; out of the exhaust port <b>78</b>&#x2032; upon advancement of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; into the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To secure the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; to the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032;, the plug connector includes a pair of diametrically opposed keys <b>200</b> extending axially from an end of the strain relief <b>50</b>&#x2032; adjacent the distal seal <b>34</b>&#x2032;. A proximal portion <b>202</b> of the receptacle connector <b>24</b>&#x2032; includes a slot <b>204</b> dimensioned to receive the keys <b>200</b>. The keys have suture lock-wire through holes (not shown) which align with apertures (not shown) extending through the proximal portions <b>202</b> such that a separate suture line (not shown) is threaded through the holes and apertures to secure the keys <b>200</b> in the slot <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, the connection of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; to the electronic control unit <b>154</b> is illustrated. The electronic control unit includes a titanium housing <b>210</b> having a wall <b>212</b> defining the cavity <b>214</b>. In one embodiment of the electronic control unit <b>154</b>, sealingly disposed within the cavity is an elastomeric receptacle <b>216</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) dimensioned to sealingly receive the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;. The elastomeric receptacle has features similar to the receptacle connectors described above. In another embodiment of the electronic control unit <b>154</b>, which is discussed in greater detail below, disposed within the cavity is a titanium shell <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>) dimensioned to sealingly receive the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electronic control unit <b>154</b> includes at least one electrical contact <b>220</b> having a surface disposed in a wall of the shell for electrical connection with at least one electrical contact <b>172</b> of the plug connector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the longitudinally spaced apart electrical contacts <b>220</b> extend from the shell wall and at least partially surrounding the shell <b>218</b>. Similar to the previous embodiments, the electrical contacts <b>220</b> are generally semi-circular. Moreover, the plurality of electrical contacts <b>172</b> of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; and the electronic control unit <b>154</b> have spherical surface portions whereby a spherical interface between the electrical contacts is formed upon make-up. This spherical interface allows slight relative articulation between the electrical contacts <b>172</b>, <b>220</b> while still maintaining a maximum of surface contact thereby reducing voltage drops between the electrical contacts. Because the shell <b>216</b> is dimensioned to matingly receive the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032;, upon insertion of the plug connector into the shell, the peripheral surface <b>174</b> of the elongated member located between adjacent electrical contacts <b>172</b> sealingly engages the shell wall to electrically isolate the adjacent electrical contacts from each other. Hermetically sealed pins <b>222</b> extend from a surface of the electrical contacts <b>220</b> through the shell <b>216</b> and are adapted to receive internal wiring, such as ribbon cable conductors <b>226</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the electronic control unit <b>154</b> further includes an opening <b>230</b> in fluid communication with the cavity <b>214</b>. As noted above, as the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; is inserted into the shell, the integrally molded proximal seals <b>32</b>&#x2032; prevent debris entrapment in the shell by wiping the shell wall, which, in turn, flushes any contaminants from the shell through the opening <b>230</b> prior to engagement of the electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To assemble the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; to the electronic control unit <b>154</b>, the suture line <b>196</b> is threaded through the hole <b>194</b> located at the end <b>190</b> of the plug connector and is knotted. An opposing end of the suture line is then pulled through the shell <b>216</b> and the opening <b>230</b> thereby inserting the plug connector into the shell. As the user continues to pull the suture line, the proximal seal <b>32</b>&#x2032; expels any fluid or air in a shell out of the opening <b>230</b> upon advancement of the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; into electronic control unit <b>154</b>. Once fully inserted, the end <b>190</b> will extend partially out of the opening <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To secure the plug connector <b>22</b>&#x2032; to the electronic control unit <b>154</b>, the keys <b>200</b> of the plug connector engage the shell which can include a slot (not shown) dimensioned to receive the keys. Moreover, a keeper <b>234</b> can be positioned in the hole <b>194</b> located at the end <b>190</b> of the plug connector.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As should be appreciated from the foregoing, because the connector assembly is flexible, there is not a severe rigid to flexible transition to cause problems with strain relieving. All electrical contacts are wiped as the connection is made, and any fluid or other contamination is extruded ahead of the proximal seals. The joints between power and signal/sensor cable leads and electrical contacts are distributed through the connector assembly, not concentrated on a terminal block, further improving strain relieving and reducing the risk of shorts or other failures.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present disclosure has been described with reference to several embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. For example, it should be appreciated that the battery and the actuator for the wiring harness can have features similar to the electronic control unit for connecting same to a cable having a plug connector. It is intended that the disclosure be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
