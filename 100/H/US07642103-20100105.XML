No. 7,405,025 which is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-344474, filed on Nov. 29, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a reticle and a method of fabricating a semiconductor device suitable for verification of process accuracy and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Any pattern transferred to a resist film using a reticle has been subjected to dimensional measurement for the purpose of confirming the accuracy. The measurement is made on a critical-dimension pattern dedicated for the measurement, previously transferred to the resist film, rather than on patterns configuring circuits for the practical use. It has been becoming more often to form the critical-dimension pattern on the dicing line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a schematic drawing of a conventional reticle. A reticle <b>101</b> is partitioned into a circuit area <b>102</b> having patterns configuring circuits for actual use formed therein, and a dicing area <b>103</b> provided therearound. The dicing area <b>103</b> has a critical-dimension pattern <b>104</b>, but no circuit patterns, formed therein. The critical-dimension pattern <b>104</b> is formed in the center portion of the dicing area <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Twice or more number of times of transfer of the pattern onto the resist film formed on a wafer through such reticle <b>101</b>, and successive development result in formation of dicing lines <b>112</b> extending longitudinally and transversely, and chip areas <b>111</b> surrounded by the dicing lines <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. On the center line of the dicing lines <b>112</b>, there are formed critical-dimension patterns <b>113</b> having a symmetric geometry. The area surrounded by a two-dot chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> corresponds to an area transferred by a single shot of light exposure. Two critical-dimension patterns <b>113</b> may seem to reside in this area, but it is to be noted that the critical-dimension pattern <b>113</b> on the right hand side is one transferred by another shot of light exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the resist film after the transfer and development is subjected to the dimensional measurement under a CD-SEM (critical dimension scanning electron microscope), one measurement-target chip area <b>111</b><i>a </i>out of a plurality of chip areas <b>111</b> is specified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the position of the critical-dimension pattern <b>113</b> which resides on the left is specified. Distance between two linear portions configuring the critical-dimension pattern <b>113</b> is then measured. It is necessary herein in the measurement to measure the distance at a measurement point <b>114</b><i>a </i>on the measurement-target chip area <b>111</b><i>a </i>side, as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>112</b>. This is because the measurement otherwise made at a measurement point <b>114</b><i>b </i>on the adjacent chip area <b>111</b><i>b</i>, which resides on the opposite side of the measurement-target chip area <b>111</b><i>a </i>on the basis of the critical-dimension pattern <b>113</b>, may raise a confusion such that the CD-SEM displays a state of the dimensional measurement as if it is made on the adjacent chip area <b>111</b><i>b</i>, despite the actual measurement being made appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is, however, difficult for the conventional method to discriminate the measurement point <b>114</b><i>a </i>on the measurement-target chip area <b>111</b><i>a </i>side as viewed from the dicing line <b>112</b>, from the measurement point <b>114</b><i>b </i>on the adjacent chip area <b>111</b><i>b </i>side, so that the measurement may be made on the distance at the measurement point <b>114</b><i>b </i>by mistake.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Similar problems occur not only for the case where one chip is exposed by a single shot of light exposure, but also for the case where a plurality of chips are exposed by a single shot of light exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Related arts are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 8-148490, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 5-333526, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Sho 59-55029.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a reticle and a method of fabricating a semiconductor device, both of which being capable of precisely specifying a desired position of the pattern during the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After extensive investigations in pursuit of solutions for the above-described problems, the present inventor has conceived several embodiments of the present invention described below.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A reticle according to the present invention comprises a circuit area having a circuit-configuring pattern, and a dicing area provided around the circuit area corresponding to a dicing line. The dicing area has a critical-dimension pattern inside the center line thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a method of fabricating a semiconductor device according to the present invention, after a circuit pattern and a critical-dimension pattern are transferred within a chip area and within a dicing line, respectively, a dimension of a critical-dimension pattern transferred by the same shot of light exposure with a measurement-target chip area. As the critical-dimension pattern, one being transferred having, as viewed from the center line of the dicing line, a portion on the same side with a chip area transferred by the same shot of light exposure, separated from another portion which resides on the opposite side.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following paragraphs will specifically explain embodiments of the present invention referring to the attached drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic drawing showing a reticle according an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A reticle <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is divided into a circuit area <b>2</b> having an actual-circuit-configuring pattern formed therein, and a dicing area <b>3</b> provided therearound. The dicing area <b>3</b> has no circuit pattern, but has critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> formed therein. The critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> are formed on the circuit area <b>2</b> side as viewed from the center line of the dicing area <b>3</b>. The critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> has two linear portions separated from each other, for example. These linear portions extend in the directions orthogonal to each other. The critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> are formed at two points in the dicing area <b>3</b>, while placing the circuit area <b>2</b> in between.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Light exposure of a resist film formed on a wafer through the reticle <b>1</b> makes a pattern (not shown) for the circuit area <b>2</b> and the critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> transferred to the resist film. The patterns described in the above can be transferred over the entire portion of the wafer, by shifting the position of the wafer by one chip for every shot of light exposure. The succeeding development makes the transferred patterns remained or removed, and makes the other portion removed or remained, depending on the positive or negative property of the resist film. Dicing lines <b>12</b> extending longitudinally and transversely, and chip areas <b>11</b> surrounded by the dicing lines <b>12</b> are thus formed in the resist film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the dicing lines <b>12</b>, there are formed critical-dimension patterns <b>13</b> so as to be paired while placing the center line in between.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the dimensional measurement of the resist film having these patterns formed therein using a CD-SEM, a measurement-target chip area <b>11</b><i>a </i>is specified, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, out of a plurality of chip areas <b>11</b>, and a position of a critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>a </i>on the left thereof is specified. Distance of two linear portions configuring the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>a </i>is measured. As described in the above, it is necessary herein to measure a portion at a measurement point <b>14</b> on the measurement-target chip area <b>11</b><i>a </i>side as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>a </i>placed on the measurement-target chip area <b>11</b><i>a </i>side as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b> and the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>b </i>placed on the adjacent chip area <b>11</b><i>b </i>side are separated from each other in the present embodiment, so that it is made possible to exactly specify the position of the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>a</i>, rather than that of the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and to measure the distance at the measurement point <b>14</b>, unlike the conventional technique. This consequently makes it possible to ensure consistency between the chip area <b>11</b> which appears, as a current target for the dimensional measurement, on a display of the CD-SEM, and a critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> under current dimensional measurement. This is successful in avoiding any confusion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Transfer of two critical-dimension patterns <b>13</b> by a single shot of light exposure so as to place the chip area <b>11</b> in between makes it possible to readily understand general misalignment and so forth possibly occurs in the light exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is to be noted that the geometry of the critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> provided to the reticle is by no means limited to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as having a single linear portion which intersects the center line of the dicing area <b>3</b> and two linear portions which extend in parallel with the center line on both sides of the center line. In this case, the critical-dimension patterns <b>4</b> are formed asymmetrically on the left and right sides of the circuit area <b>2</b> so as to avoid overlapping of the critical-dimension patterns between the adjacent chip areas during the pattern transfer. One preferable case has only a single critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> formed only on the left of the circuit area <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> formed in the resist film through the reticle <b>1</b> is such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> obtained herein consists of a single linear portion which intersects the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b> and two linear portions which extend in parallel with the center line on both sides thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also in this case, with respect to two linear portions extending in parallel with the center line, the one placed on the measurement-target chip area <b>11</b><i>a </i>side as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b> and the other placed on the adjacent chip area <b>11</b><i>b </i>side are separated from each other, so that it is made possible to exactly measure the distance at the measurement point <b>14</b>. This consequently makes it possible to ensure consistency between the chip area <b>11</b> which is, for example, displayed by the CD-SEM as a current target for the dimensional measurement, and a critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> under current dimensional measurement, without causing any confusion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is also allowable, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to provide the critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only on one side of the circuit area <b>2</b>. In this case, the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is formed in the resist film, and this makes it possible to exactly measure the distance at the measurement point <b>14</b>, without causing any confusion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above description dealt with the case where the dicing area <b>3</b> on the reticle <b>1</b> is aligned with the dicing line <b>12</b> formed in the resist film, so that the pattern formed on the circuit area <b>2</b> side as viewed from the center line of the dicing area <b>3</b> is transferred on the chip area <b>11</b> side, the chip being formed by the same shot of light exposure, as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b>, but those are not essential matters. For example, even the critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> formed beyond the center line of the dicing area <b>3</b> makes it possible to exactly measure the distance at the measurement point <b>14</b> without causing any confusion between the measurement-target chip area <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the adjacent chip area <b>11</b><i>b</i>, if the pattern <b>4</b> is transferred on the chip area <b>11</b> side, the chip area <b>11</b> being formed by the same shot of light exposure, as viewed from the center line of the dicing line <b>12</b>, and if the desired measurement point <b>14</b> is separated from the measurement point which resides on the adjacent chip area side.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The critical-dimension pattern <b>4</b> formed on the reticle <b>1</b> may be either of a removed pattern or remained pattern, depending on the positive or negative property of the resist film.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is still also allowable to directly form the critical-dimension pattern <b>13</b> in the resist film typically by electron beam lithography, without using the reticle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention makes it possible to exactly carry out the measurement of the critical-dimension pattern at a desired position. This is successful in avoiding unnecessary confusion even when the dimensional measurement is made under a CD-SEM.</p>
