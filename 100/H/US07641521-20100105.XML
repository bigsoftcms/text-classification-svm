<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter herein relates generally to electrical connectors, and more particularly, to electrical connectors that use compensation loops to enhance electrical performance and/or to improve thermal management.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electrical connectors are commonly used in telecommunication systems. The electrical connectors, such as modular jacks and modular plugs, provide an interface between successive runs of cables and/or between cables and electronic devices in such systems. These connectors have contacts which are arranged according to a known industry standard such as Electronics Industries Alliance/Telecommunications Industry Association (&#x201c;EIA/TIA&#x201d;)-568. These connectors have traditionally been used for data transmission, wherein the contacts of the connectors transmit data signals therebetween. There is a growing trend toward using these types of connectors in Power-Over-Ethernet applications, wherein power is transmitted between the electrical connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to increases in data transmission rates in telecommunications systems, the electrical performance of the electrical connector is effected by crosstalk. Prior art techniques have focused on modular jacks and on arranging the contacts within the housing of the electrical connector to provide compensation for the crosstalk. However, controlled positioning of the contacts is difficult to achieve in manufacture or assembly, and the electrical connectors tend to have a high amount of variation between different electrical connectors. Additionally, electrical connectors that are used in Power-Over-Ethernet applications carry current through the contacts, which may damage the contacts during use, such as by overheating the contacts. A need remains for an electrical connector that compensates for signal degradation and/or thermal degradation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, an electrical connector is provided that includes a housing and a plurality of contacts within the housing. The electrical connector also includes a compensation component housed within the housing. The compensation component has a substrate with a first trace plane and a second trace plane, and the compensation component has a plurality of traces arranged on the first trace plane. The traces are electrically connected to selected ones of the contacts. At least one of the traces includes a compensation loop arranged on the first trace plane, and at least one of the traces includes a compensation loop arranged on the second trace plane. The compensation loop provides at least one of electrical and thermal compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optionally, each compensation loop may include at least two tap points along the respective trace. At least one of the traces may include a compensation loop extending from the trace in a first direction and another compensation loop extending from the trace in a second direction different than the first direction. Each trace may include a primary trace, wherein each primary trace is arranged within the first trace plane and extends parallel to one another, and wherein each trace includes at least one compensation loop that extends substantially perpendicular from the primary trace. Optionally, each trace may include a primary trace and the compensation loops, wherein the compensation loops are positioned relatively closer to an adjacent trace to increase an amount of inductive coupling therebetween. The contacts may be configured for power transmission, wherein each compensation loop splits the current path into parallel paths to reduce the heat generated for a given region of the current path. The length and proximity of the compensation loops may be selected to control the electrical performance of the electrical connector. Optionally, the substrate may define multiple layers with each layer defining a potential trace plane, wherein compensation loops are provided on at least three of the potential trace planes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, an electrical connector is provided that includes a housing and a plurality of contacts within the housing. The electrical connector also includes a compensation component housed within the housing. The compensation component has a substrate and a plurality of traces electrically connected to selected ones of the contacts, wherein each of the traces include at least one compensation loop having at least two tap points along the respective trace. The compensation loops are arranged to control the electrical performance of the electrical connector. Optionally, at least one of the traces may include a compensation loop extending from the trace in a first direction and another compensation loop extending from the trace in a second direction different than the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further embodiment, an electrical connector is provided that includes a housing and a plurality of contacts within the housing. The electrical connector also includes a compensation component housed within the housing. The compensation component has a substrate with a top and a bottom. The compensation component also has four traces arranged on the top of the substrate, with first and second traces defining a first differential pair and third and fourth traces defining a second differential pair. Each trace has at least one compensation loop extending therefrom, wherein the compensation loops are arranged to control the electrical performance of the electrical connector.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Optionally, the compensation loops associated with the first and third traces may be arranged along the bottom of the substrate. The substrate may include an intermediate layer between the top and the bottom, wherein at least two of the traces include compensation loops arranged along the intermediate layer to provide either inductive or capacitive coupling therebetween. Optionally, the third trace may have a compensation loop arranged along the intermediate layer to control coupling between the first and third traces, and the fourth trace may have a compensation loop arranged along the intermediate layer to control coupling between the second and fourth traces. At least one of the second and third traces may include a compensation loop arranged along the top of the substrate that extends between the second and third traces to control coupling between the second and third traces.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The connector <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> extending between a mating end <b>104</b> and a loading end <b>106</b>. A cavity <b>108</b> extends between the mating end <b>104</b> and the loading end <b>106</b>. The cavity <b>108</b> receives the mating plug through the mating end <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The connector <b>100</b> includes a contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> received within the housing <b>102</b> through the loading end <b>106</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. The contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> is secured to the housing <b>102</b> via tabs <b>112</b>. The contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> extends between a mating end <b>114</b> and a wire terminating end <b>116</b> and is held within the housing <b>102</b> such that the mating end <b>114</b> of the contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> is positioned proximate the mating end <b>104</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.

The contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> includes an array of mating pins or mating contacts <b>118</b>. Each of the mating contacts <b>118</b> include a mating interface <b>120</b> arranged within the cavity <b>108</b> to interface with corresponding pins or contacts (not shown) of the mating plug when the mating plug is joined with the connector <b>100</b>. The arrangement of the mating contacts <b>118</b> may be controlled by industry standards, such as EIA/TIA-568. In an exemplary embodiment, the connector <b>100</b> includes eight mating contacts <b>118</b> arranged as differential pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> includes a plurality of wire terminating contacts <b>122</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at the wire terminating end <b>116</b>. The contacts <b>122</b> are connected to a circuit board <b>124</b>, and interconnected to corresponding ones of the contacts <b>118</b> by the circuit board <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A base <b>126</b> extends between the mating end <b>114</b> of the contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> and the circuit board <b>124</b>. The mating contacts <b>118</b> are supported by the base <b>126</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of parallel channels <b>128</b> extend rearward from the mating end <b>114</b>. Portions of the contacts <b>118</b> are received in corresponding channels <b>128</b>. Optionally, the contacts <b>118</b> are movable within the channels <b>128</b> to allow flexing of the contacts <b>118</b> as the connector <b>100</b> is mated with the mating plug. Each of the contacts <b>118</b> extends generally parallel to one another and the mating interfaces <b>120</b> of each contact <b>118</b> are generally aligned with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an exemplary embodiment, the electrical connector <b>100</b> includes at least one compensation component that is configured to electrically connect to selected ones of the mating contacts <b>118</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the circuit board <b>124</b> defines a first compensation component, and may be referred to hereinafter as the first compensation component <b>124</b>. Additionally, the base <b>126</b> of the contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> may include or define a second compensation component <b>140</b>. While two compensation components <b>124</b>, <b>140</b> are shown and described in the illustrated embodiment, any number of compensation components may be provided in alternative embodiments. Some embodiments may include only a single compensation component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described in further detail below, the compensation components <b>124</b>, <b>140</b> are configured to control the electrical performance of the electrical connector <b>100</b>. The compensation components <b>124</b>, <b>140</b> may be configured to provide thermal management and control heat dissipation, such as in a Power-Over-Ethernet application. The compensation components <b>124</b>, <b>140</b> include elements, such as traces on at least one surface of a circuit board, that provide electrical and/or thermal compensation, either for controlling electrical interactions, such as by inductive or capacitive coupling, or for controlling heat dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view of the electrical connector <b>100</b> with the contact sub-assembly <b>110</b> received within the housing <b>102</b>.

Compensation components having structures other than circuit boards having traces may be used in alternative embodiments. For example, an overmolded leadframe may define a compensation component.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first compensation component <b>124</b> is positioned within the housing <b>102</b> such that first ends <b>156</b> of the mating contacts <b>118</b> engage the substrate <b>150</b>. More specifically, the mating contacts <b>118</b> are coupled to the circuit board <b>124</b> by through-hole mounting, however other interconnection means may be provided. As such, the first compensation component <b>124</b> is directly connected to the mating contacts <b>118</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the substrate <b>150</b> is rectangular in shape, and is oriented vertically within the housing <b>102</b>, which is generally parallel to the mating end <b>104</b> and the loading end <b>106</b>.</p>

In an alternative embodiment, the mating contacts <b>118</b> may indirectly engage the traces of the substrate <b>154</b>. For example, an interconnecting element or contact, such as a metal plate may extend between the substrate <b>154</b> and the mating contact <b>118</b>.</p>

Some of the traces <b>160</b> may not include any compensation loops <b>168</b>. The primary trace <b>162</b> and the compensation loops <b>168</b> cooperate to define paths or circuits. In the illustrated embodiment, four traces <b>160</b> are provided that correspond to, and provide compensation for, four of the mating contacts <b>118</b>, such as the middle four mating contacts <b>118</b>. The paths or circuits defined by the traces <b>160</b> are identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as path P<b>1</b>, path P<b>2</b>, path P<b>3</b> and path P<b>4</b>. Optionally, paths P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> may correspond to one differential pair and paths P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b> correspond to another differential pair. However, any number of traces <b>160</b> and paths may be provided in alternative embodiments, and the number of traces <b>160</b> and paths may or may not correspond to the number of mating contacts <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A first interface <b>174</b> is provided at the first end <b>164</b> of each of the primary traces <b>162</b>. A second interface <b>176</b> is provided at the second end <b>166</b> of each of the primary traces <b>162</b>. The interfaces <b>174</b> and/or <b>176</b> provide a location for interfacing with the mating contacts <b>118</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and/or terminating contacts <b>122</b>. The interfaces <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> define through-holes for receiving the mating contacts <b>118</b> and the terminating contacts <b>122</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an exemplary embodiment, the primary traces <b>162</b> are each provided on a top surface <b>178</b> of the substrate <b>150</b>. The top surface <b>178</b> defines a first trace plane <b>180</b>. At least some of the compensation loops <b>168</b> are also provided on the first trace plane <b>180</b>. Optionally, at least some of the compensation loops <b>168</b> may be provided on a bottom surface <b>182</b> of the substrate <b>150</b>, which defines a second trace plane <b>184</b>. The traces <b>160</b> may extend along vias <b>186</b> that extend between the top surface <b>178</b> and the bottom surface <b>182</b>. The vias <b>186</b> form part of the path and electrically interconnect the compensation loops <b>168</b> with the primary traces <b>162</b>. In alternative embodiments, additional trace planes may be provided on which the compensation loops <b>168</b> may be provided. For example, a multi-layer circuit board may be provided wherein traces may be provided on any of the layers of the circuit board. Additionally, in some embodiments, the primary traces <b>162</b> may be provided on any of the trace planes, as opposed to each of them being on the first trace plane <b>180</b>, as in the illustrated embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The compensation loops <b>168</b> are located in predetermined locations and with predetermined lengths and/or widths to provide electrical and/or thermal compensation. The thermal compensation is provided by increasing the overall trace or path surface area. In power applications, by providing a compensation loop <b>168</b>, the current transmitted along the path (e.g. path P<b>1</b>) is split between the primary trace <b>162</b> and the compensation loop <b>168</b>, thus increasing the overall surface area of the trace <b>160</b>. Thus, the trace <b>160</b> is able to dissipate more heat as compared to the amount of heat that may be dissipated by the primary trace <b>162</b> alone. The electrical compensation is provided by inductive or capacitive coupling between the traces <b>160</b>. A predetermined amount of coupling is provided between the various primary traces <b>162</b>. Adjacent primary traces <b>162</b> have stronger coupling than remote, non-adjacent primary traces <b>162</b>. The compensation loops <b>168</b> enhance the coupling between various ones of the traces <b>160</b> and the placement and orientation of the compensation loops <b>168</b> may be used to control the amount of compensation. For example, the amount of compensation may depend on the signal path area, the length or surface area of the primary trace <b>162</b> and the compensation loops <b>168</b>, the trace material and/or the dielectric material of the substrate <b>150</b>, the thickness of the substrate <b>150</b>, the proximity of the compensation loops <b>168</b> to the adjacent primary trace <b>162</b> and/or other compensation loops <b>168</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the illustrated embodiment, each of the interfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> are separated by a distance <b>188</b>.

The primary traces <b>162</b> are each parallel to one another. The first path P<b>1</b> includes a compensation loop <b>168</b> on the second trace plane <b>184</b>. The compensation loop <b>168</b> extends generally perpendicularly from the primary trace <b>162</b> through vias <b>186</b> proximate the first interface <b>174</b> and the second interface <b>176</b>. The portion of the compensation loop <b>168</b> on the second trace plane <b>184</b> is generally parallel to the primary trace <b>162</b>.

One of the compensation loops <b>168</b> is also more closely positioned with respect to the primary trace of the third path P<b>3</b> to increase the coupling between the second path P<b>2</b> and the third path P<b>3</b>. The lengths of traces forming the compensation loops <b>168</b> are selected to control an amount of coupling between the first path P<b>1</b> and the second path P<b>2</b>. As such, the electrical characteristics and interactions therebetween can be tuned. For example, a given amount of cross-talk can be achieved and/or the impedance of the circuit can be controlled to a certain amount, such as 100 Ohms. Other electrical characteristics may also be controlled by selecting the length, surface area and/or position of the compensation loops <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The third path P<b>3</b> includes a compensation loop <b>168</b> on the second trace plane <b>184</b>.

The number of vias <b>186</b> may increase the overall path length of the third path P<b>3</b>. One of the vias <b>186</b> is located proximate the first interface <b>174</b>. Positioning the compensation loop <b>168</b> on the same trace plane as the compensation loop <b>168</b> of the first path P<b>1</b>, namely the second trace plane <b>184</b>, coupling may be achieved between the first path P<b>1</b> and the third path P<b>3</b>.
