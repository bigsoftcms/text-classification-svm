<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priorities to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2004-0098550 and 10-2004-0098551 filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 29, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a secondary battery module, and more particularly, to a cooling structure of a secondary battery module constructed by connecting a plurality of unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, unlike a primary battery which is not rechargeable, a secondary battery is capable of being charged and discharged. A low-capacity secondary battery composed of a single battery cell is used as a power source for various small portable electronic devices such as cellular phones, notebook computers, and camcorders. A high-capacity secondary battery in which a plurality of battery cells are connected to each other in a pack structure is used as a power source for driving a motor of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Secondary batteries are manufactured in various shapes. Generally, secondary batteries may be classified as a cylindrical shape battery or a prismatic shape battery, depending on the external shape of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By serially connecting such secondary batteries, a high-capacity secondary battery is constructed to be used as a power source for driving a motor in equipment such as an electric vehicle, which needs high power.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this way, one high-capacity secondary battery (hereinafter referred to as a &#x2018;battery module&#x2019; throughout the specification) is composed of a plurality of secondary batteries (hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;unit batteries&#x2019; throughout the specification) which are generally connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each of the unit batteries includes an electrode assembly having a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator interposed therebetween, a case having a space for accommodating the electrode assembly, a cap assembly combined with the case to seal the case, and positive and negative terminals protruding upward from the cap assembly and electrically connected to positive and negative collectors provided in the electrode assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When prismatic batteries are used as the unit batteries, in order to construct a battery module, the unit batteries are generally alternately arranged, and the positive and negative terminals are serially connected such that the positive and negative terminals which protrude upward from the cap assembly alternate relative to positive and negative terminals of another unit battery adjacent thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One battery module includes a plurality of unit batteries. For this reason, it is important that the heat generated in the respective unit batteries can be easily radiated. In particular, when the secondary battery is applied to an HEV, it is important to satisfy these conditions first.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, when the heat cannot be efficiently radiated, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries causes an increase in the temperature of the battery module, which results in malfunction of an apparatus to which the battery module is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, when an HEV battery module for a vehicle is used, the battery module is charged and discharged with large currents. For this reason, depending on how the battery module is being used, heat is generated by an internal reaction in the secondary batteries, which deteriorates battery performance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, generally, when a battery module includes a plurality of secondary batteries, more particularly, when the battery module includes prismatic secondary batteries, a battery barrier rib is provided between the unit batteries so as to maintain a gap between the unit batteries. The gap is provided for a heat transfer medium to circulate between the unit batteries. Further, these unit batteries are inside a housing, whereby the heat transfer medium for controlling the temperature of the unit batteries is provided in the housing. Thus, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries is cooled by circulating the heat transfer medium through the battery barrier rib.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, in such a conventional cooling method, the circulating quantity of the heat transfer medium does not stay constant due to the inflow structure of the heat transfer medium of the housing. This is due to a driving condition of the battery module, a flow condition of the heat transfer medium, and a climate condition generating temperature variations between the respective unit batteries. Accordingly, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries is not evenly radiated, which results in a decrease of charging and discharging efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, in this conventional cooling method, since the flow quantity of the heat transfer medium which circulates through the battery barrier ribs between the respective unit batteries does not stay constant, temperature variations between the respective unit batteries are generated. Accordingly, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries is not evenly dissipated, which results in a decrease of charging and discharging efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, various embodiments of the present invention have been made to solve the above-described problems, and to provide a secondary battery module having a structure which enables a constant quantity of a heat transfer medium to smoothly circulate between unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one aspect of the present invention; a secondary battery module includes a unit battery pack having a plurality of unit batteries disposed at predetermined intervals, and a housing having the unit battery pack disposed therein. A heat transfer medium for controlling temperature of the plurality of unit batteries circulates in the housing. A flow control unit controls a flow quantity of the heat transfer medium circulating between the respective batteries and is disposed in the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the battery module according to this aspect of the invention, the unit battery pack includes battery barrier ribs which separate the respective unit batteries from each other, and circulation paths for passing the heat transfer medium therethough formed in the battery barrier ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A battery module according to an aspect of the invention includes a flow control unit made of a plate member having nozzle holes with a size gradually increasing in a direction from the center of the housing to the periphery of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in the battery module according to this aspect of the invention, a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can be supplied into the circulation paths between the respective unit batteries by adjusting the size of the nozzle holes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, according to another aspect of the present invention, a secondary battery module includes a unit battery pack having a plurality of unit batteries arranged at predetermined intervals, and a housing having the unit battery pack built therein. A heat transfer medium for controlling temperature of the respective unit batteries circulates in the housing. A first dispersion plate is fixedly disposed in the housing so as to be adjacent to the unit battery pack, and it distributes the heat transfer medium between the respective unit batteries. A second dispersion plate, which is slidably disposed on the first dispersion plate, distributes the heat transfer medium between the respective unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The housing may further include an inflow part for allowing the heat transfer medium to flow in the unit battery pack in an inflow direction and an outflow part for discharging the heat transfer medium which has passed through the respective unit batteries in a discharge direction. The inflow direction of the heat transfer medium coincides with the discharge direction of the heat transfer medium.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another aspect of the invention, the inflow part is formed such that a sectional area of the flow of the heat transfer medium gradually increases toward the unit battery pack. A flow velocity of the heat transfer medium flowing through the inflow part may gradually decrease in a direction from a center portion of the unit battery pack to the periphery of the unit battery pack.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, in a battery module according to an aspect of the invention, each of the unit batteries is formed in a prismatic shape, and the first and second dispersion plates are formed in a rectangular shape. In this embodiment, the second dispersion plate overlaps the first dispersion plate so as to slide back and forth on the first dispersion plate in a width or a length direction of the first dispersion plate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The housing may have a guide member for guiding the movement of the second dispersion plate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first and second dispersion plates may be provided with a plurality of nozzle holes for passing therethrough the heat transfer medium flowing through the inflow part. The size of the nozzle holes gradually increases in a direction from a center of a flow of the heat transfer medium to a periphery of the flow. The size of the nozzle holes may gradually increase in a direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack to the outside of the unit battery pack.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The size of the respective nozzle holes may vary depending on the movement of the second dispersion plate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the unit batteries may be formed in a cylindrical shape. In one embodiment, the unit battery pack includes a circular package part for packaging the unit batteries. Further, the first and second dispersion plates are formed in a circular shape which corresponds to the package part, and the second dispersion plate overlaps the first dispersion plate so as to slide on the first dispersion plate in a circumference direction of the first dispersion plate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings such that the invention can be carried out by a person skilled in the art. However, the invention is not limited to the embodiments, but various modifications can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a battery module <b>100</b> is a high-capacity battery module, and includes a plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b> which are arranged at predetermined intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the unit batteries <b>11</b> has an electrode assembly, which has a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. In the present embodiment, the unit batteries <b>11</b> have a substantially rectangular shape (having a pair of long sides and a pair of short sides in the present embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>, battery barrier ribs <b>15</b> are disposed to support the side face of the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> while maintaining intervals between these unit batteries</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Circulation paths <b>17</b> are formed in the respective battery barrier ribs <b>15</b> to allow a heat transfer medium to circulate between these respective unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, in the battery module <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, a plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b> are separated from each other with the battery barrier ribs <b>15</b> therebetween to form a unit battery pack <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The battery module <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>30</b> having the unit batteries <b>11</b> and the battery barrier ribs <b>15</b> built therein. Further, the housing <b>30</b> functions as a cooling system which cools the heat generated in the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> by circulating the heat transfer medium in the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A mount part <b>32</b> for supporting the unit batteries <b>11</b> is formed in the housing <b>30</b> so as to fix the positions of the unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The housing <b>30</b> functions as a passage through which the heat transfer medium circulates, and includes an inflow part <b>34</b> into which the heat transfer medium flows and an outflow part <b>35</b> from which the heat transfer medium is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The inflow part <b>34</b> includes an inlet <b>34</b><i>a</i>into which the heat transfer medium flows, and is constructed such that a flow area gradually increases in a direction from the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>to the inside of the housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The outflow part <b>35</b> includes an outlet <b>35</b><i>a </i>such that the heat transfer medium which has passed through the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> is discharged in the same direction as the inflow direction of the heat transfer medium.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inflow part <b>34</b>&#x2032; of the battery module <b>100</b>&#x2032; may be formed bent in one direction, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outflow part <b>35</b> may be formed in the same direction as the circulation path.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Therefore, the heat transfer medium which flows in the inflow part <b>34</b>&#x2032; through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>flows slowly since the heat transfer medium spreads as the flow area increases. Further, when the heat transfer medium is spreading, the density of the heat transfer medium becomes decreased as the heat transfer medium flows from the center of the housing to the edge thereof. Thus, the further the heat transfer medium moves to the edge, the slower the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the battery module <b>100</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sectional area of the circulation paths <b>17</b> is constant, and the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium which flows in the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>gradually decreases as the heat transfer medium flows from the center of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside. Therefore, the quantity of the heat transfer medium which passes though the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> gradually becomes decreased as the heat transfer medium flows from the center of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Therefore, the quantity of the heat transfer medium which passes through the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> does not stay constant with respect to the unit battery pack <b>13</b>, which prevents the temperature of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> from being uniform over the entire region of the unit battery pack <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The battery module <b>100</b> of the present invention provides a flow control unit <b>40</b> which is disposed inside the housing <b>30</b> to control the flow quantity of the heat transfer medium circulating in the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The flow control unit <b>40</b> includes a plurality of holes (also referred to hereinafter as nozzle holes) through which the heat transfer medium passes. The size of the holes varies in the flow control unit <b>40</b> so that a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can circulate in the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>. The flow control unit <b>40</b> in this embodiment includes first and second dispersion plates <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> arranged at the inflow part <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, a dispersion plate <b>41</b> is formed in a rectangular plate shape covering the unit battery pack <b>13</b>. The dispersion plate <b>41</b> is integrally disposed in the inflow part <b>34</b> of the housing <b>30</b> or is combined with the inflow part <b>34</b> and fixedly disposed therein so as to be adjacent to the unit battery pack <b>13</b> in the housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first dispersion plate <b>41</b> functions as a so-called diffuser which disperses the heat transfer medium, whose quantity varies depending on the location of the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>, into the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other words, the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> functions as a first heat transfer medium induction means which disperses and distributes the heat transfer medium. This distribution controls temperature flow into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>so as to eventually supply a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium into the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first dispersion plate <b>41</b> has a plurality of first nozzle holes <b>43</b> for passing the heat transfer medium flowing into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>through the first nozzle holes <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, the size of the nozzle holes <b>43</b> gradually increases in a direction from the inflow center of the heat transfer medium to the outside. The nozzle holes <b>43</b> may be formed in a circular, an elliptical, or a polygonal shape. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, the nozzle hole <b>43</b> is formed in a circular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> is disposed so as to obstruct the heat transfer medium flowing into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a</i>, and the size of the nozzle holes <b>43</b> gradually increases in a direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, the first nozzle holes <b>43</b> are plurally disposed in locations corresponding to the respective circulation paths <b>17</b>, and may be continuously disposed at predetermined intervals or may be irregularly disposed. In addition, instead of the first nozzle holes, single holes may be disposed in locations corresponding to the respective circulation paths <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A second dispersion plate <b>42</b> according to the present embodiment is formed in a rectangular plate shape which corresponds to the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>, and overlaps the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> so as to slide on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> may slide in a length direction A of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>. For this, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> has the same width as the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> and has a length smaller than the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As indicated by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a guide member <b>36</b> for substantially guiding the sliding of the second dispersion <b>42</b> is disposed in the inflow part <b>34</b> of the housing <b>30</b>. The guide member <b>36</b> includes protrusions which protrude from the inflow part <b>34</b> to guide the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> in a slide direction, such as in the length direction (A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> slides back and forth on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> in the length direction A, as an outer peripheral portion of the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> is guided by the guide member <b>36</b> in a state of contact with the top face of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032; of the flow control unit <b>40</b>&#x2032; may alternately slide on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032; in a width direction B. For this reason, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032; has the same length as the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032; and has a width smaller than the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the present embodiment, the flow control unit <b>40</b>&#x2032; may further include actuating member <b>47</b> which actuates the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032;. The actuating member <b>47</b> according to the present embodiment is an electronic actuator, but the invention is not limited thereto, as various actuating units may be applied as the actuating member.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above and as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the guide member <b>36</b>&#x2032;, which substantially guides the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032; to slide, is disposed in the inflow part <b>34</b> of the housing <b>30</b>. The guide member <b>36</b>&#x2032; is formed of protrusions <b>36</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>which protrude from the inflow part <b>34</b> to guide the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032; in the slide direction, that is, in the width direction of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032;. Therefore, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>&#x2032; slides on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032; in the width direction B along the guide member <b>36</b>&#x2032; in a state of contact with the top face of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, and <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>C, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032; having the above-described structures functions as a diffuser which disperses the heat transfer medium, whose quantity varies depending on the location of the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>, into the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>, in the same manner as the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>, <b>41</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other words, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032; functions as a second heat transfer medium induction means which disperses the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature flowing into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>so as to eventually supply a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium into the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032; has second nozzle holes <b>44</b> for passing the heat transfer medium flowing into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a</i>. In the embodiments described above, the size of the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> gradually increases toward the periphery of the inflow.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second nozzle holes <b>44</b> may be formed in a circular, an elliptical or a polygonal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, in the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032;, the size of the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> gradually increases in a direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside. In other words, the size of the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> gradually becomes smaller in a direction from a portion which corresponds to the circulation path <b>17</b> of the battery barrier rib <b>15</b> located at the outermost portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to a portion which corresponds to the circulation path <b>17</b> of the battery barrier rib <b>15</b> located at the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b>. As shown, the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> are plurally disposed in locations corresponding to the respective circulation paths <b>17</b>, and the number and size of the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> correspond to those of the first nozzle holes <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The second nozzle holes <b>44</b> may be disposed at predetermined intervals or may be irregularly disposed. Alternatively, single holes may be disposed at locations corresponding to the respective circulation paths <b>17</b>. The differences between the nozzle holes <b>44</b> from the outside of the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> to the center thereof may vary. In one embodiment, the nozzle holes <b>44</b> have sectional areas inversely proportional to the flow velocity which gradually decreases in a direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside, so that the quantity of the heat transfer medium passing through the second nozzle holes <b>44</b> is constant when continuity equation of fluid dynamics is considered.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, since the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium which flows into the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> is large in general, the sectional area of the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> which correspond to the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> is adjusted. The further to the outside of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> the heat transfer medium flows, the slower the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium gradually becomes. Therefore, sectional areas of the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> which correspond to the portions toward the outside of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> are adjusted to gradually become larger, so that the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> have sectional areas inversely proportional to the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium passing through the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Besides the structure of the above inflow part <b>34</b>, the size of the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> can be selectively adjusted depending on a driving condition of the battery module <b>100</b>, a flow condition of the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature, and a climate condition.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In above-described embodiments of the present invention, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032; has a single plate capable of sliding on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>, <b>41</b>&#x2032;; however, the structure is not limited thereto. The second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>&#x2032; may have two or more plates.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a heat transfer medium supply part <b>38</b> for supplying the heat transfer medium into the housing <b>30</b> is disposed at the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>30</b> so as to absorb the heat transfer medium with a predetermined rotational force. Further, the heat transfer medium supply part <b>38</b> includes a fan (not shown) having a typical structure which jets the heat transfer medium into the housing <b>30</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The above-described heat transfer medium supply part <b>38</b> is not limited to having such a fan, however. The heat transfer medium supply part <b>38</b> may further include a pump or blower which fans the heat transfer medium.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the battery module <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature flows into the housing <b>30</b> along the height direction of the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>by the heat transfer medium supply part <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the heat transfer medium has a duct shape in which a sectional area of the inflow part <b>34</b> gradually increases in the direction from the inlet <b>34</b><i>a </i>to the unit battery pack <b>13</b>, the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium gradually becomes smaller in the direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">While the heat transfer medium flows, the heat transfer medium circulates into the circulation paths <b>17</b>, passing through the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. As the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> slides on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>, the first and second dispersion plates <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are arranged so that the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> correspond to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Since the size of the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> of the first and second dispersion plates <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> gradually increases in the direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>13</b> to the outside, the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> have sectional areas inversely proportional to changes of the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium. Accordingly, a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can pass through the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Therefore, the battery module <b>100</b> can allow a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium to pass through the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the unit batteries <b>11</b> corresponding to the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. While the heat transfer medium flows, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> is exchanged with the heat transfer medium, the heat transfer medium which is exchanged with the heat escapes from the circulation paths <b>17</b> and is discharged through the outlet <b>35</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the quantity of the heat transfer medium passing through the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> does not stay constant due to a driving condition of the battery module <b>100</b>, the flow condition of the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature, and the climate condition, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> is slid on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> in the width or length direction. Then, while the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> is in contact with the top face of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>, the second dispersion plate <b>42</b> is guided by the guide member <b>36</b> so as to slide on the first dispersion plate <b>41</b> in the width or length direction of the first dispersion plate <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore, the sectional area of the first and second holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> of the first and second dispersion plates <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> varies depending on the movement of the second dispersion plate <b>42</b>, and thus a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can pass through the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the present embodiment, a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can pass through the circulation paths <b>17</b> between the unit batteries <b>11</b> corresponding to the first and second nozzle holes <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. Accordingly, the heat generated in the respective unit batteries <b>11</b> can be evenly distributed so as to be cooled, and thus a constant temperature can be sustained over the entire area of the unit battery pack <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a battery module <b>200</b> has a structure in which the respective unit batteries <b>21</b> are formed in a cylindrical shape and a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium is circulated into the circulation paths <b>27</b> between the respective unit batteries <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, the unit batteries <b>21</b> are continuously or irregularly disposed separately from each other by a package part <b>24</b>, to be further described below, so as to form a unit battery pack <b>23</b> having a circular external appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The package part <b>24</b> has a circular case for integrally packaging the unit batteries <b>21</b>, and is formed of materials having insulating properties and relatively high thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Insertion holes <b>24</b><i>a</i>, in which the respective unit batteries <b>21</b> are inserted so as to be substantially fixed, are formed in the package part <b>24</b>. The circulation paths <b>27</b> for circulating the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature are formed between and surrounding the respective unit batteries <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The battery module <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment includes a cylindrical housing <b>50</b> having the unit battery pack <b>23</b> built therein.

As an outer peripheral portion of the second dispersion plate <b>62</b> is guided by a guide member <b>56</b> (indicated by a virtual line in the drawing), which is disposed to protrude from the housing <b>50</b> in the circumference direction, the second dispersion plate <b>62</b> rotates in the circumference direction C. A plurality of second nozzle holes <b>64</b> for passing the heat transfer medium are formed in the second dispersion plate <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The sectional area of the second nozzle holes <b>64</b> gradually increases in the direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>23</b> to the outside. That is, the sectional area of the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> of the first and second dispersion plates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> is varied by the rotation of the second dispersion plate <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Therefore, the battery module <b>200</b> according to this embodiment has a structure in which the sectional area of the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> gradually increases in the direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>23</b> to the outside even though the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium gradually decreases in the direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>23</b> to the outside. Accordingly, a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium can be supplied into the circulation paths <b>27</b> between the unit batteries <b>21</b> through the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the quantity of the heat transfer medium passing through the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> is not constant due to the driving condition of the battery module <b>200</b>, the flow condition of the heat transfer medium for controlling temperature, and the climate condition, the second dispersion plate <b>62</b> is rotated in the circumference direction C of the first dispersion plate <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Accordingly, as the sectional area of the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> of the first and second dispersion plates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> varies depending on the rotation of the second dispersion plate <b>62</b>, the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> have the sectional area inversely proportional to the changes of the flow velocity of the heat transfer medium. Therefore, a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium may pass through the first and second nozzle holes <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Since an operation of the battery module <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment is substantially the same as that of the former embodiments, a detailed description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side cross sectional view schematically showing the unit battery pack construction of the battery module according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a battery module <b>100</b>&#x2033; includes a flow control unit <b>70</b> made of one plate. The flow control unit <b>70</b> is formed in a rectangular plate shape which corresponds to the size of the unit battery pack <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The flow control unit <b>70</b> has a dispersion member <b>71</b> which is integrally disposed in the inflow part <b>34</b> of the housing <b>30</b> or is combined with the inflow part <b>34</b> and fixedly disposed therein so as to be adjacent to the unit battery pack <b>13</b> in the housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The heat transfer medium dispersion member <b>71</b> has a plurality of nozzle holes <b>73</b> for passing the heat transfer medium flowing into the inflow part <b>34</b> through the inlet <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The size of the nozzle holes <b>73</b> gradually increases in the direction from portions corresponding to the inflow center of the heat transfer medium to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The nozzle holes <b>73</b> may be formed in a circular, an elliptical, or a polygonal shape. However, the nozzle holes <b>73</b> are shown formed in a circular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Therefore, even though the heat transfer medium flowing in the inflow part <b>34</b> is not evenly distributed to the outside due to an enlarged sectional area, the dispersion member <b>71</b> compulsorily distributes the heat transfer medium so as to evenly cool the unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a flow control unit <b>80</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention can be applied to the battery module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is made of one plate member, unlike the flow control unit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The flow control unit <b>80</b> according to the present embodiment includes a heat transfer medium dispersion member <b>81</b> formed in a circular plate shape which corresponds to the size of the unit battery pack <b>23</b>. Such a heat transfer medium dispersion member <b>81</b> has a plurality of nozzle holes <b>83</b> for passing the heat transfer medium flowing into the housing <b>50</b> toward the unit battery pack <b>23</b>, and the sectional area of the nozzle holes <b>83</b> gradually increases in a direction from the center portion of the unit battery pack <b>23</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the heat transfer medium flows in, the sectional area of the inflow part <b>34</b> is enlarged. Therefore, even though the heat transfer medium is not evenly distributed to the outside, the dispersion member <b>81</b> compulsorily distributes the heat transfer medium so as to evenly cool the unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing a state in which the battery module <b>100</b> shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>,<b>5</b> and <b>7</b> is connected to a motor <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to various embodiments of the present invention, the flow control unit capable of selectively controlling a cooling heat transfer medium which circulates in the circulation paths between the unit batteries is provided. Therefore, even though there are changes in the inflow structure of the heat transfer medium in the housing, the driving condition of the battery module, the flow condition of the heat transfer medium, and the climate condition, temperature all over the unit battery pack can be made even by smoothly circulating a constant quantity of the heat transfer medium in the circulation paths between the unit batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Therefore, there are effects that optimize the cooling efficiency of the whole unit batteries and improve the charging and discharging efficiency of the battery module.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Here, the above-described secondary battery (or the battery module) can be used as a power source for driving a motor of equipment such as a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), an electric vehicle (EV), a wireless cleaner, an electric-powered bicycle, an electric-powered scooter or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Even though various examples of embodiments of the invention have been described in detail hereinabove, the invention is not limited to these embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
