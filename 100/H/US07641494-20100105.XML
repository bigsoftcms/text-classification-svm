<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a connector, and in particular to a waterproof connector and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern connectors are widely used in outdoor places. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for waterproof connectors. Most of the connection in the connector is achieved by metals of good electrical conductivity so as to transmit electrical signals. However, these metals may get wet easily to affect the transmission and even get failed. Although some waterproof connectors are available in the market, the waterproof effect thereof is not perfect enough.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a conventional connector. A common connector comprises a plurality of electrically conductive terminals <b>10</b><i>a</i>, an electrically insulating base <b>20</b><i>a</i>, an electric wire <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a cladding <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The right side of the electrically insulating base <b>20</b><i>a </i>is formed with a receiving section <b>21</b><i>a </i>and an accommodating trough <b>22</b><i>a </i>for allowing each of the electrically conductive terminals <b>10</b><i>a </i>to pass though and be fixed therein. One end of each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>a </i>is exposed to the outside of the receiving section <b>21</b><i>a</i>. The electric wire <b>30</b><i>a </i>has a plurality of cores. Each of the cores is connected to each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The cladding <b>40</b><i>a </i>is used to cover each of the electrically conductive terminals <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the electrically insulating base <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a portion of the electric wire <b>30</b><i>a</i>. However, such kind of connector has disadvantages as follows. Since the cladding <b>40</b><i>a </i>is made by means of an injection molding process to cover each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the electric wire <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the cladding <b>40</b><i>a </i>may hit the connecting portion between each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the electric wire <b>30</b><i>a </i>during the injection of the plastics, which causes poor contact or the breakage in the soldering portions. As a result, the yield rate is reduced. Further, since the electrically insulating base <b>20</b><i>a </i>made of a hard material and the cladding <b>40</b><i>a </i>made of a soft material are attached to each other tightly, gaps may be generated between these two materials after being used for a period of time because the difference between the physical properties of these two materials is too large. Thus, moisture may penetrate in the gaps to make the electrically conductive terminals wet, which affects the normal function thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above problems, the industry of this art has developed another kind of connector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a receiving section <b>21</b><i>b </i>extends from one end of the electrically insulating base <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the connector. The interior of the receiving section <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed with an accommodating trough <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The soldering portion between each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the electrical wire <b>30</b><i>b </i>is formed in the accommodating trough <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The receiving section <b>21</b><i>b </i>acts to protect the soldering portion between each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the electrical wire <b>30</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the cladding <b>40</b><i>b </i>may not hit the soldering portion directly during the injection of the plastics, so that the electrically conductive terminals <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the electrical wire <b>30</b><i>b </i>may not suffer damage. However, such a solution may generate other problems as follows. Since the soldering position between each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the electrical wire <b>30</b><i>b </i>is formed in the accommodating trough <b>22</b><i>b</i>, it is not easy to solder each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the electrical wire <b>30</b><i>b </i>because the working space is too small. As a result, the yield rate is reduced. Further, if the yield rate of the soldering process is to be increased, the length of each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>should be enlarged to make each electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b><i>b </i>to protrude from the receiving section <b>21</b><i>b</i>. However, a long electrically conductive terminal will be bent easily and suffer damage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is an important issue to provide a waterproof connector to improve the yield rate of production and increase the structural strength of the connector.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is to provide a waterproof connector and a method for manufacturing the same. With a hollow cylinder being connected to a receiving section and a cladding covering the receiving section and the hollow cylinder, the conventional problem that the difference between the physical properties of two materials is so large to affect the firm connection of the two materials can be solved. Thus, the external moisture may not penetrate easily, and thus the lifetime can be extended.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is to provide a waterproof connector and a method for manufacturing the same. The hollow cylinder is connected to the receiving section and covers the connecting portions between the electrically conductive terminals and the cores. During the injection molding process, the plastics will not hot the connecting portions directly, thereby increasing the yield rate of products.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is to provide a waterproof connector and a method for manufacturing the same. The hollow cylinder and the cladding are made of the same material. Thus, the present invention eliminates the conventional problem occurred in connecting different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is to provide a waterproof connector and a method for manufacturing the same, whereby a better bending resistance can be obtained even when the length of the electrically insulating base is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is to provide a waterproof connector, which includes a plurality of electrically conductive terminals, an electrically insulating base, an electrical wire, a hollow cylinder and a cladding. The electrically insulating base allows the electrically conductive terminals to pass through and be fixed therein. The electrically insulating base has a receiving section. The electrical wire has a plurality of cores. The cores are connected to one end of each of the electrically conductive terminals respectively. The hollow cylinder is connected to the receiving section and located to one side of the electrical wire. The cladding is used to cover the receiving section, the hollow cylinder, the core and one end of electrically conductive terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a waterproof connector, including the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a) penetrating a plurality of electrically conductive terminals in an electrically insulating base respectively;</p>

Further, the outer surface of the end of the hollow cylinder <b>40</b> away from the receiving section <b>21</b> is formed with a plurality of positioning rings <b>42</b>, thereby enhancing the engaging force of the cladding <b>50</b> with the hollow cylinder <b>40</b> and the electrically insulating base <b>20</b> without falling off easily, thereby increasing the waterproof effect in the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the present invention. The method and structure of the present invention can be used to an AC waterproof connector. The method for manufacturing this connector is the same as that of the previous embodiment, and thus the description thereof is omitted for clarity. However, in terms of the structure, the interior of the receiving section <b>21</b> is formed with an accommodating trough <b>22</b>. The interior of the electrically insulating base <b>20</b> is provided with a plurality of penetrating holes <b>24</b> communicating with the accommodating trough <b>22</b>. The electrically conductive terminal <b>10</b> has an insertion end <b>11</b> and a connecting end <b>12</b> connected to the insertion end <b>11</b>. The electrically conductive terminals <b>10</b> penetrate in the penetrating holes <b>24</b> and are fixed therein. The insertion end <b>11</b> is exposed to the outside of the electrically insulating base <b>20</b>, and the connecting end <b>12</b> is located in the hollow cylinder <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the waterproof connector of the present invention and the method for manufacturing the same, the present invention has advantages as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(1) The hollow cylinder is connected with the receiving section of the electrically insulating base tightly. Then, the cladding is injected to cover the electrically insulating base, so that the electrically insulating base and the cladding can be connected with each other firmly. Thus, gaps may not be generated easily and the waterproof effect is increased. In this way, the problem of poor connection because of the large difference between the physical properties of the two materials occurred in manufacturing conventional connectors can be solved efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">(2) The hollow cylinder is used to connect with the receiving section of the electrically insulating base, and is formed outside the connecting end and the electrical wire. Thus, such a structure can prevent the plastic material of the cladding from hitting the connecting end directly during the injection molding process. Therefore, the poor contact between the connecting end and the electrical wire and the possible separation can be avoided. In this way, the yield rate can be increased efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(3) The hollow cylinder is used to connect with the receiving section of the electrically insulating base, and is formed outside the connecting end and the electrical wire. Thus, such a structure can prevent the plastic material of the cladding from hitting the cores directly during the injection molding process. Therefore, the cores will not be hit by the plastics of the cladding to move and expose the cores outside the cladding, thereby increasing the external appearance of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(4) The hollow cylinder is used to connect with the receiving section of the electrically insulating base, thereby enhancing the structural strength of the waterproof connector and the resistance to shear force and the tension force. Therefore, the waterproof connector can be used for a long time, and even may not snap after bending several times.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(5) The hollow cylinder is used to connect with the receiving section of the electrically insulating base. The hollow cylinder is formed outside the connecting end. When the hollow cylinder is made of a hard material, it can protect the connecting end and the electrical wire efficiently. Thus, the connecting end and the electrical wire inside the hollow cylinder can be prevented from suffering damage when the waterproof connector is bent.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the present invention has been described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details thereof. Various equivalent variations and modifications can still occur to those skilled in this art in view of the teachings of the present invention. Thus, all such variations and equivalent modifications are also embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
