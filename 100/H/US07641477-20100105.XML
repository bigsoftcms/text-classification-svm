<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/235,873, filed Sep. 26, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter of the present disclosure generally relates to a magnetic connector for an electronic device and more particularly relates to an electromagnetic connector for a power adapter connecting a laptop computer to a power supply.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices, such as laptop computers, typically use DC power supplied from a transformer connected to a conventional AC power supply. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a power adapter <b>20</b> according to the prior art is illustrated. The power adapter <b>20</b> has a transformer <b>22</b>, a power cable <b>26</b>, a male connector <b>30</b>, and a female connector <b>40</b>. The transformer <b>22</b> has a plug <b>24</b> for connecting to a conventional AC power outlet (not shown), and the male connector <b>30</b> is connected to the transformer <b>22</b> by power cable <b>26</b>. The female connector <b>40</b> is typically attached to the housing <b>12</b> of an electronic device <b>10</b>, such as a laptop computer, and is typically attached to a printed circuit board <b>14</b> of the internal electronics of the device <b>10</b>. To make the conventional power connection between the transformer <b>22</b> and the device <b>10</b>, the male connector <b>30</b> has a male end <b>32</b> that inserts into the female connector <b>40</b>. Connectors for portable computers are preferably as small as possible and low profile for today's thin notebooks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Damage can occur to the conventional power connection in a number of ways. In one example, simply inserting the male connector <b>30</b> into the female connector <b>40</b> can cause damage. In another example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, damage can occur when any of the components (e.g., the device <b>10</b>, male connector <b>30</b>, transformer <b>22</b>, etc.) is inadvertently pulled away from other components by a non-axial force while the male and female connectors <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> are still connected together. In addition to conventional power connections, damage of other types of connections to electronic devices can also occur in the same ways described above.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the surface area of two magnetically attracted halves determines the number of magnetic flux lines and therefore the holding force between them because the holding force is proportional to the contact area between the two magnetically attracted halves. Thus, to have a strong force holding the two magnetically attracted halves together, the two magnetically attracted halves want to be as large as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter of the present disclosure is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A magnetic connector that relies on magnetic force for maintaining contact is disclosed. The magnetic connector includes a plug and a receptacle. In one embodiment, the plug and receptacle can be used as part of a power adapter for connecting an electronic device, such as a laptop computer, to a transformer connectable to a power supply. The plug includes a plurality of electrical pins, which are preferably biased towards a corresponding plurality of contacts positioned on the receptacle. The plug and receptacle each have a magnetic element. The magnetic element on one or both of the plug and receptacle can be a magnet, which is preferably a permanent rare earth magnet although electromagnets may also be used. A ferromagnetic element can be used for the magnetic element on the plug or receptacle that does not include a magnet. When the plug and receptacle are brought into proximity, the magnetic attraction between the magnet and its complement, whether another magnet or a ferromagnetic material, magnetically couples the plug and the receptacle and maintains the pins and contacts in an electrically conductive relationship. The magnetic connector allows the plug to break away from the receptacle if the plug or receptacle is inadvertently moved (with sufficient force) while still connected.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>100</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated in a cross-sectional view. The magnetic connector <b>100</b> includes a first connector or plug <b>110</b> and a second connector or receptacle <b>150</b>. The plug <b>110</b> is connectable to a first device or electrical relation <b>50</b>, while the receptacle <b>150</b> is connectable to a second device <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, the first device <b>50</b> is a transformer, and the second device <b>60</b> is an electronic device, such as a laptop computer, having a housing <b>62</b> and internal electronics <b>64</b>. Therefore, in one embodiment, the magnetic connector <b>100</b> can be part of a power adapter for connecting the laptop computer <b>60</b> to a conventional AC power supply (not shown) with the transformer <b>50</b>. For a standard laptop computer, the magnetic connector <b>100</b> is preferably rated for 6 A at 24V, and the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> can both be approximately 4-mm tall and 6-mm wide.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The plug <b>110</b> includes a plug body <b>112</b> having a face <b>118</b> and connected to a cable <b>114</b>. Preferably, the body <b>112</b> is composed of a conventional non-conductive material. The body <b>112</b> houses internal wires <b>116</b> of the cable <b>114</b>, which connects to the first device <b>50</b>. A plurality of first electrical contacts <b>120</b> and a first magnetic element <b>130</b> are positioned on the plug body <b>112</b>. In a preferred embodiment and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first electrical contacts <b>120</b> are preferably plated and spring loaded pins to maintain contact with the corresponding contacts on the receptacle <b>150</b>. The pins <b>120</b> are held in housings <b>124</b> and are connected to the wires <b>116</b> of the cable <b>114</b>. Springs <b>122</b> bias the pins <b>120</b> so that they extend from the face <b>118</b> of the plug body <b>112</b>. In the present embodiment, the first magnetic element <b>130</b> is embedded in the face <b>118</b> of the plug body <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The receptacle <b>150</b> has a body <b>152</b> connected to the housing <b>62</b> of the second device <b>60</b>. The body <b>152</b> has a face <b>158</b>, a plurality of second electrical contacts <b>160</b>, and a second magnetic element <b>140</b>. In a preferred embodiment and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second electrical contacts <b>160</b> are plates embedded in the face <b>158</b> of the body <b>152</b> and electrically connected to the internal electronics <b>64</b> by wires <b>162</b> or the like. In addition, the second magnetic element <b>170</b> is embedded in the face <b>118</b> of the body <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To make the electrical connection between the first and second devices <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, the face <b>118</b> of the plug <b>110</b> is positioned against the face <b>158</b> of the receptacle <b>150</b>. The pins <b>120</b> on the plug <b>110</b> engage the plates <b>160</b> on the receptacle <b>150</b>. Thus, the wires <b>116</b> connected to the first device <b>50</b> are electrically connected to the wires <b>162</b> connecting to the internal electronics <b>64</b> of the second device <b>60</b>. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, electrical connection between pointed pins <b>120</b> and substantially flat plates <b>160</b> is preferred for a number of reasons, such as issues related to Hertzian stresses around a contact point and issues related to contact asperities or aspots.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To maintain the electrical connection, the attractive force between the first and second magnetic elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> holds the plug <b>110</b> to the receptacle <b>150</b>. In one embodiment, both magnetic elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> are magnets, either permanent or electromagnetic, arranged to attract magnetically to one another. In an alternative embodiment, either magnetic element <b>130</b> or <b>170</b> is a magnet, either permanent or electromagnetic, while the other complementary element is a ferromagnetic material. The permanent magnet used for the magnetic elements is preferably a permanent rare earth magnet because rare earth magnets have a high flux density compared to their size. When the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> are brought into proximity, the attractive force between the magnetic elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> maintains the contacts <b>120</b> and <b>160</b> in an electrically conductive relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The magnetic attraction or force of the plug <b>110</b> coupled to the receptacle <b>150</b> can be configured for a particular implementation as desired. For embodiments of the magnetic connector <b>100</b> used for a power adapter, the magnetic field produced by the magnetic attraction between the elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> is small enough not to interfere with the supply of power through the electrical contacts <b>120</b> and <b>160</b>. Because magnetic fields of the elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> may interfere with the internal electronics <b>64</b> and other components of the device <b>60</b>, the receptacle <b>150</b> may be positioned on the housing <b>150</b> at a location away from various components. For example, the receptacle <b>150</b> may be positioned away from disk drives, USB ports, internal busses, etc. of a laptop computer. Alternatively, the elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> may be shielded from various components of the electronic device, or a flux bar may be used to direct any magnetic flux of the elements <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> away from various components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment shown in the front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the receptacle <b>150</b> has four electrical plates <b>160</b> positioned around the centrally located magnetic element <b>170</b>. The body <b>152</b> of the receptacle is oval or oblong and has two axes of symmetry. For the embodiment of the receptacle <b>150</b> requiring DC power, two of the electrical plates <b>160</b>(+) may be positive contacts, and two of the plates <b>120</b>(&#x2212;) may be negative contacts. Various arrangements are possible and would be within the abilities on one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment shown in the front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the plug <b>110</b> is made to correspond with the arrangement of the receptacle <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Therefore, the body <b>112</b> of the plug <b>110</b> is also oval, and the plug has four pins <b>120</b> positioned around the magnetic element <b>130</b>, which is centrally located on the plug <b>110</b>. For the embodiment of the plug <b>110</b> connected to an AC to DC transformer, two of the electrical contacts <b>120</b>(+) are positive contacts, and two of the contacts <b>120</b>(&#x2212;) are negative contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The arrangement of the pins <b>120</b> and plates <b>160</b> is symmetrical along the axes of symmetry defined by the oval or oblong shape of the bodies <b>112</b> and <b>152</b>. In this way, the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> can be coupled in only two ways, and proper alignment of positive pins <b>120</b>(+) with positive plates <b>160</b>(+) and of negative pins <b>120</b>(&#x2212;) with negative plates <b>160</b>(&#x2212;) will be ensured. Although the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> are shown having one magnetic element <b>130</b> and <b>170</b> each, it will be appreciated that each can include one or more magnetic elements. In addition, it will be appreciated that the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> can each have one or more contacts, depending on the type of electrical connection to be made. For example, additional pins and contacts may be symmetrically arranged around the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> for passing electrical signals between two devices, such as a laptop computer and power adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an ability of the magnetic connector <b>100</b> to prevent possible damage is illustrated. The magnetic connector <b>100</b> substantially avoids damage because male components are not required to have an interference fit with female components to maintain both electrical and mechanical connection. Instead, a user of the connector <b>100</b> needs only to position the faces <b>118</b> and <b>158</b> of the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> against or away from one another when making or releasing the electrical and magnetic connection therebetween. Being biased towards plates <b>160</b>, the pins <b>120</b> can avoid damage while still maintaining contact with the plates <b>160</b>. In addition, the magnetic connector <b>100</b> can substantially avoid damage by allowing the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> to break free of one another when inadvertently pulled away from each other by a non-axial force. Although shown slightly recessed in the device <b>60</b>, the face <b>158</b> of the receptacle <b>150</b> can also be flush with the housing or can protrude therefrom. However, the recess is used to prevent stray magnetic fields from interfering with other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, another embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>200</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated. This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref> so that like reference numbers indicate similar components. In contrast to previous embodiments, the receptacle <b>250</b> in this embodiment is not housed in a device (not shown) to which it is connected as with previous embodiments. Rather, the receptacle <b>250</b> resembles the plug <b>110</b> in that it has a body <b>252</b> that connects to the device with a cable <b>254</b>. In addition, the bodies <b>112</b> and <b>252</b> of the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> are substantially round. To ensure proper alignment of the pins <b>120</b> with the plates <b>160</b>, the plug <b>10</b> and receptacle <b>150</b> have complementary guides <b>119</b> and <b>159</b> that allow for only one way of coupling them together. Although the guides <b>119</b> and <b>159</b> are shown on the faces <b>118</b> and <b>158</b> of the plug <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>150</b>, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a number of guides and techniques can be used to ensure proper alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B, another embodiment of a magnetic connector according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated. A first connector or plug <b>310</b> of the magnetic connector is shown in a partial side cross-section and in a front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>. A second connector or receptacle <b>350</b> of the magnetic connector is shown in a partial side cross-section and in a front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>. Both the plug <b>310</b> and receptacle <b>350</b> can be at least partially composed of transparent, non-conductive material and can include internal lights, such as LEDs, to illuminate them.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>, the plug <b>310</b> includes a body <b>312</b>, a plurality of pins <b>320</b>, and a first magnetic element <b>330</b>, and a shell <b>340</b>. The body <b>312</b> is made of any suitable non-conductive material and has an oblong shape with two axes of symmetry A<sub>1 </sub>and A<sub>2</sub>. The body <b>312</b> houses internal wires <b>316</b> of a cable <b>314</b>, which connect the pins <b>320</b> to a first device (not shown), such as a transformer, for example. The pins <b>320</b> are biased by springs, and the pins <b>320</b> extend from a face <b>318</b>, which is slightly recessed in the plug body <b>312</b>. The first magnetic element <b>330</b> is positioned on the end of the plug body <b>312</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the first magnetic element <b>330</b> surrounds the recessed face <b>318</b> of the body <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For the embodiment of the plug <b>310</b> connected to a transformer, the centrally located pin <b>320</b> can be designated for signals used by the electronic device to determine the type of transformer or other device attached by the plug <b>310</b>. The two outer located pins <b>320</b> can be designated for the positive DC power, and the outer shell <b>340</b> is designated for the return path of DC power. In this way, any orientation of the plug <b>310</b> will ensure proper connection of positive pins <b>320</b>(+) and signal pin <b>320</b>(S) of the plug <b>310</b> with corresponding contacts of the receptacle (<b>350</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>). Using the outer shell <b>340</b> for the return path is preferred because the plug <b>310</b> can have a smaller profile. In an alternative embodiment, however, the return path can be provided by additional pins (not shown) on the plug <b>310</b> and receptacle <b>350</b>. For example, two additional pins (not shown) for the additional return path could be provided and symmetrically arranged on the plug <b>310</b> such that the pins would only align with corresponding contacts (not shown) of the receptacle <b>350</b> regardless of the orientation in which the plug <b>310</b> is coupled to the receptacle <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, the receptacle <b>350</b> has a body <b>352</b>, a plurality of contacts <b>360</b>, and a second magnetic element <b>370</b>, and a shell <b>380</b>. The body <b>352</b> has a casing <b>356</b> with legs <b>357</b> for mechanical connection to a printed circuit board of internal electronics of a second device (not shown), such as a laptop computer, for example. The casing <b>356</b> can be composed of a conductive or non-conductive material. The body <b>352</b> has an oblong shape with two axes of symmetry A<sub>1 </sub>and A<sub>2 </sub>and is made of any suitable non-conductive material. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the body <b>352</b> also has snap connectors <b>359</b> for mechanical connection to a mounting base (not shown). In addition, the receptacle <b>350</b> has pins <b>364</b> for connecting the contacts <b>360</b> to internal electronics of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The body <b>352</b> has an end <b>354</b> intended to extend outside the device housing the receptacle <b>350</b>. This end <b>354</b> may be illuminated by techniques known in the art. The contacts <b>360</b> are positioned in a face <b>358</b> of the body <b>352</b>. In the present embodiment, the contacts <b>360</b> are substantially flat plates electrically connected to the pins <b>364</b> by wires <b>362</b>. The second magnetic element <b>370</b> is positioned about the face <b>358</b>, and the second magnetic element <b>370</b> is preferably recessed from the face <b>358</b>. Preferably, the recess of the second magnetic element <b>370</b> is slight and is comparable to the recess of the face (<b>318</b>) of the plug (<b>310</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. For the embodiment of the receptacle <b>350</b> intended to connect DC power to the device, the plates <b>360</b> are arranged to correspond with the positive pins (<b>320</b>(+)) and signal pin (<b>320</b>(S)) of the plug (<b>310</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>, as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To make the electrical connection, the face <b>318</b> of the plug <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is positioned against the face <b>358</b> of the receptacle <b>350</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. The pins <b>320</b> on the plug <b>310</b> engage the plates <b>360</b> on the receptacle <b>350</b>. To maintain the connection, the first and second magnetic elements <b>330</b> and <b>370</b> magnetically couple together and hold the plug <b>310</b> to the receptacle <b>350</b>. In one embodiment, the magnetic elements <b>330</b> and <b>370</b> are both permanent magnets (preferably rare earth magnets) arranged to magnetically couple together. In another embodiment, one of the magnetic elements <b>330</b> and <b>370</b> can be a permanent magnet (preferably a rare earth magnet) or an electromagnet while the other element is a ferromagnetic material. Once coupled, the magnetic connector <b>300</b> allows the plug <b>310</b> to break away from the receptacle <b>350</b> in the event of inadvertent pulling of the plug <b>310</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, additional details of the plug <b>310</b> and receptacle <b>350</b> for the disclosed magnetic connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B are illustrated in a perspective view. Portions of the plug <b>310</b> and receptacle <b>350</b> are not illustrated so that various details can be better shown. On the plug <b>310</b>, the shell <b>340</b> abuts the magnetic element <b>310</b>, which can be a ferromagnetic material. The shell <b>340</b> has an extension <b>342</b> for connecting to the return path of the power supply from the adapter (not shown) to which the plug <b>310</b> is connected. Three connectors <b>322</b>(+), <b>322</b>(S), and <b>322</b>(+) extend from the back end of the body <b>312</b> for connecting the pins (not shown) with the positive power and signal from adapter to which the plug <b>310</b> is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">On the receptacle <b>350</b>, the shell <b>380</b> for the return path of the power is positioned within the casing <b>356</b>, and the magnetic element <b>370</b>, which can be a permanent magnet, is positioned within the shell <b>380</b>. An opening <b>372</b> through the magnetic element <b>370</b> allows for passage of body material (not shown) and contacts (not shown), as disclosed previously. Tabs or holders <b>382</b> of the shell <b>380</b> contact and hold the magnetic element <b>370</b>. A leg <b>384</b> of the shell <b>380</b> extends from the receptacle <b>350</b> as do legs <b>357</b> of the casing <b>356</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the plug <b>330</b> is coupled with the receptacle <b>350</b>, the ferromagnetic material <b>330</b> of the plug <b>310</b> positions against the permanent magnet <b>370</b> and the inside of the casing <b>380</b> of the receptacle <b>350</b>. Thus, the magnetic engagement between the ferromagnetic material <b>330</b> and the permanent magnet <b>370</b> holds the plug <b>310</b> to the receptacle. Moreover, the physical engagement between the ferromagnetic material <b>330</b> and the casing <b>380</b> creates the return path for power from the receptacle's shell pin <b>384</b> to the plug's shell pin <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11B</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>360</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated. The connector <b>360</b> is compact and preferably has a low profile. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, a plug <b>370</b> of the connector <b>360</b> is shown in a front perspective. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, some of the internal components of plug <b>370</b> and a receptacle <b>390</b> are shown in a back perspective. The receptacle <b>390</b> is housed in an electronic device (not shown), and the plug <b>370</b> attaches to a cord or the like (not shown). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the plug <b>370</b> has magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b> positioned on both sides of a plurality of contacts <b>376</b>, which are similar to other contacts disclosed herein. For example, the central contact <b>376</b> is designated for a first path of electrical communication, and the two outer contacts <b>376</b> are designated for a second path of electrical communication. Preferably, the contacts <b>376</b> are biased pins where the central pin <b>376</b> carries a signal path and the two side pins carry a positive current. The magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b> are arranged with opposite polarities, as indicated by the direction of the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. Preferably, the magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b> are also designated for a third path of electrical communication.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the plug <b>370</b> also has a back plate <b>372</b> connected between the back ends of the magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b>. The back plate <b>372</b> is made of a ferromagnetic material, such as steel. The receptacle <b>390</b> has an attraction plate <b>392</b> also made of a ferromagnetic material, such as steel. When the attraction plate <b>392</b> of receptacle <b>390</b> is attracted to the magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b>, the magnetic field lines travel through the steel attraction plate <b>392</b> from one magnet to the other, completing the magnetic circuit and producing a strong attracting force.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The attraction plate <b>392</b> of receptacle <b>390</b> defines an opening <b>394</b> for passage of the electrical contacts (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). Likewise, the back plate <b>372</b> of the plug <b>370</b> defines openings <b>374</b> for passage of leads from the electrical contacts (not shown). As noted above, the magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b> can form a path of electrical communication between the receptacle <b>390</b> and the plug <b>370</b>. Preferably, the magnets <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> and the attraction plate <b>392</b> carry negative current. Thus, the attraction plate <b>392</b> of the receptacle <b>390</b> includes a connector <b>396</b> for connecting to an electrical lead or the like (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because the connector <b>360</b> is designed to be compact and have a low profile for fitting into a laptop or the like, the plates <b>372</b> and <b>392</b> must give up a certain amount of material to produce the openings <b>374</b> and <b>394</b>. When the attraction plate <b>392</b> and magnets <b>380</b>, <b>382</b> are coupled, magnetic attractive force can be limited because the flux density can saturate the narrower portions of ferromagnetic material in both the attraction plate <b>392</b> and the back plate <b>374</b>. (Therefore, it may be desirable to use more than two magnets with the connector, as disclosed in the embodiment below). It may be desirable to have more than two magnets within the connector for two reasons. First, magnetic strength is a function of magnet thickness to cross section ratio (with thickness being defined by the dimension along the direction of magnetization). Second, for a given envelop, the leakage field associated with more than two permanent magnets is less than the leakage field associated with one or two permanent magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref>, another embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>360</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated. The magnetic connector <b>360</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref> is substantially similar to that disclosed above so those like numerals indicate similar components between the embodiments. In the present embodiment, however, the plug <b>370</b> houses four magnets <b>380</b>, <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, and <b>383</b>. Again, the magnets <b>380</b>, <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, and <b>383</b> are arranged with opposite polarities, as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. In the present embodiment, the four magnets <b>380</b>, <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, and <b>383</b> form four magnetic circuits for the travel of magnetic flux. Accordingly, most of the flux travels between magnets on the same side (e.g., between magnets <b>380</b>, <b>381</b> on the same side and between magnets <b>382</b>, <b>383</b> on the same side). Because the flux lines are not constrained by the narrow portions of the plates <b>372</b> and <b>392</b>, the flux density is less likely to saturate the plates <b>372</b> and <b>392</b>. Therefore, the magnetic attractive force between the receptacle <b>390</b> and the plug <b>370</b> having four magnets <b>380</b>-<b>384</b> can be significantly greater than available in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11B</figref>, even though both embodiments have the same contact area.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As noted previously, the magnetic attraction or force coupling the plug <b>370</b> and the receptacle <b>390</b> can be configured as desired for a given implementation. In one embodiment, a straight pullout force to uncouple the plug <b>370</b> from the receptacle <b>390</b> is preferably between 3-lbf and 7-lbf. It should be noted that pulling the plug <b>370</b> out sideways, up, or down can produce torque. Preferably, the magnetic attraction produces less torque in the up direction but produces more torque in the other directions. Target torque values can be 0.5 kgf-cm for the up direction and 0.7 to 1.5 kgf-cm in the other directions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one aspect, the asymmetrical torque values can be achieved by extending the upper magnets <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> upwards. In this way, the upper magnets <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> are stronger and provide more attraction upwards than the lower magnets <b>381</b> and <b>383</b>. One resulting effect is that there can be more holding force and displacement of the application point of the force upward, subsequently leading to more torque. This also helps compensate for any downward torque that may be produced by a cable (not shown) coupled to the plug <b>370</b>. In another aspect, the asymmetrical torque values can be achieved by changing the angle of the magnetic flux lines in the upper magnets <b>380</b> and <b>382</b>. For example, the separate, upper magnets <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> can have flux direction that point downward at an approximately 20-degree angle in comparison to the direction of coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>400</b> having an electromagnet is illustrated. The connector <b>400</b> includes a plug <b>410</b> and a receptacle <b>450</b>. The plug <b>410</b> is not substantially different from that disclosed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-8B</figref>. The plug <b>410</b> has contacts <b>420</b> for conveying power from a transformer (not shown) and has a magnetic element <b>430</b>, which can be a ferromagnetic material. The receptacle <b>450</b> has contacts <b>460</b> for conveying power to internal electronics <b>76</b> of the device <b>70</b>, which is a laptop computer in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In contrast to previous embodiments, the receptacle <b>450</b> has an electromagnet formed by a metal core <b>470</b> wrapped by a wire coil <b>472</b>. Using an electromagnet in the plug <b>410</b> or receptacle <b>450</b> can overcome some of the disadvantages of having a permanent magnet on either the plug <b>410</b> or receptacle <b>450</b>. For example, the electromagnet may reduce potential interference with internal components of the electronic device <b>70</b> or storage media.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The coil <b>472</b> is connected to a power supply or battery <b>72</b> of the laptop <b>70</b>, and an internal switch <b>74</b> among other electronics can be used to operate the electromagnet of the core <b>470</b> and coil <b>472</b>. The internal switch <b>74</b> causes power from the battery <b>72</b> to energized the electromagnet of core <b>470</b> and coil <b>472</b>. Consequently, the energized electromagnet produces a magnetic field that attracts the ferromagnetic material <b>430</b> of the plug <b>410</b> and that can hold the plug <b>410</b> to the receptacle <b>450</b>. The battery <b>72</b> can be an independent battery of the device or can be the same battery used to power the internal electronics <b>76</b> of the device <b>70</b>. In either case, operation of the internal switch <b>74</b> and other electronics for connecting the battery <b>72</b> to the electromagnetic is preferably controlled to conserve power consumption of the battery <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, another embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>500</b> having an electromagnet is illustrated.

The receptacle <b>550</b> is not substantially different from that disclosed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A-9B</figref>. The receptacle <b>550</b> has contacts <b>560</b> for conveying power and signals to internal electronics <b>76</b> of the device <b>70</b>. The receptacle <b>550</b> also has a magnetic element <b>570</b>, which can be a ferromagnetic material. The plug <b>510</b> has contacts <b>520</b> for conveying power and signals from a power supply, such as power adapter <b>80</b>, via wires <b>522</b> of a cable <b>86</b>. In contrast to previous embodiments, the plug <b>510</b> has an electromagnet formed by a metal core <b>530</b> wrapped by a wire coil <b>532</b>. The coil <b>532</b> is connected to a power supply by wires <b>534</b>. For example, the coil <b>532</b> can draw power output from the transformer <b>82</b> of the adapter <b>80</b>, form a conventional power supply to which the outlet plug <b>88</b> connects, or from a battery <b>84</b> housed internally in the adapter <b>80</b>. Use of the battery <b>84</b> can overcome the need for a user to first connect the adapter <b>80</b> to the power supply before the electromagnet in the plug <b>510</b> is operated and can magnetically connect to the receptacle <b>550</b>. The drawn power energizes the electromagnet of core <b>530</b> and coil <b>532</b> to produce a magnetic attraction to the ferromagnetic material <b>570</b> that can hold the plug <b>510</b> to the receptacle <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>600</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated. The connector <b>600</b> has a plug <b>602</b> having contacts <b>604</b> and an electromagnet <b>606</b>. The connector <b>600</b> also has a receptacle <b>620</b> positioned on a portable computer or electronic device <b>630</b>. The receptacle <b>620</b> has an attraction plate or magnet <b>622</b> and contacts <b>624</b>. The contacts <b>624</b> act as paths for electrical communication so that they are electrically coupled to internal electronics <b>632</b> of electronic device <b>630</b>. In addition, the attraction plate or magnet <b>622</b> acts as a path of electrical communication so that it is also electrically coupled to the internal electronics <b>632</b>. In the schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, various components, such as leads, contacts, and coils, are not shown for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the present embodiment, the electromagnet <b>606</b> is in the plug <b>602</b>; however, it can be positioned in the receptacle <b>620</b>. The electromagnet <b>606</b> derives its power from circuitry <b>612</b> of the power adapter <b>608</b> so the electromagnet <b>606</b> does not drain a battery (not shown) of the electronic device <b>630</b>. In the present embodiment, the plug <b>602</b> includes a switch element <b>610</b> interrupting the electrical connection between the electromagnet <b>606</b> and the circuitry <b>612</b> of the adapter <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, the switch element <b>610</b> includes a mechanical switch that a user presses to turn the electromagnet <b>602</b> on and off. Any mechanical switch, such as a conventional micro-switch, for controlling the power load of the electromagnet <b>602</b> is suitable for the connector <b>600</b>. In general, the switch element <b>610</b> allows the electromagnet <b>606</b> to run directly from power of the adapter <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment, the switch element <b>610</b> includes a touch sensor that energizes (e.g., turns on) the electromagnet <b>606</b> when a user touches the sensor <b>610</b> by picking up the plug <b>602</b>. Touch sensors are known in the art. For example, the touch sensor <b>610</b> can include logic circuitry and contacts (not shown) and can use principals of capacitance of the human body for operation. Once activated by the touch sensor <b>610</b>, the electromagnet <b>606</b> can remain energized for a time interval to allow the user to couple the plug <b>602</b> to the receptacle <b>620</b> and to turn on the electronic device <b>630</b>. Once the energized electromagnet <b>606</b> is magnetically coupled to the attraction plate <b>622</b> of the receptacle <b>650</b>, the contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b> that form a signal path between the adapter <b>608</b> and the device <b>630</b>, and a signal along the signal path can be used to keep the touch sensor <b>610</b> activated and the electromagnet <b>606</b> energized.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the plug <b>602</b> is connected and the electromagnet <b>606</b> energized, the touch sensor <b>610</b> can turn off the electromagnet <b>606</b> when touched to allow the user to disconnect the plug <b>602</b>. Alternatively, the touch sensor <b>610</b> can reduce the energization of the electromagnet <b>606</b> to enable easy removal by the user but to keep a small remaining attraction. In addition, when the device <b>630</b> is turned off, the device <b>630</b> may no longer send a signal along the signal path of the contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b> or may send a quit signal to the touch sensor <b>610</b> to stop energization of the electromagnet <b>606</b>. Then, the de-energized electromagnet <b>606</b> can allow the plug <b>602</b> to be released from the electronic device <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In yet another embodiment, the switch element <b>610</b> includes a motion sensor, which detects when the plug <b>602</b> is moved. The motion sensor <b>610</b> can maintain the electromagnet <b>606</b> energized for a time interval to allow the user to couple the plug <b>602</b> with the receptacle <b>620</b> and to turn on the electronic device <b>630</b>. Once coupled, the signal path formed by contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b> can allow a signal to control the circuitry of the motions sensor <b>610</b> to maintain it activated while coupled to the device <b>630</b>. The motion sensor <b>610</b> can automatically shut off the electromagnet <b>606</b> so as to release the plug <b>602</b> from the device <b>630</b> if a sudden movement occurs (e.g., the device <b>630</b> is dropped or pulled away with the plug <b>602</b> connected).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>600</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated having an electromagnet <b>606</b> and a proximity sensor <b>640</b>. Reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> that are the same as those in other Figures represent like components between embodiments. The proximity sensor <b>640</b> is positioned in the plug <b>602</b> and is coupled to a switch element <b>642</b>. The electromagnet <b>606</b> is also coupled to the switch element <b>642</b>, which in turn is coupled to circuitry <b>644</b> for providing power located in the adapter <b>608</b>. The proximity sensor <b>640</b> and switch element <b>642</b> turn on the electromagnet <b>606</b> when the sensor <b>640</b> is positioned near plate <b>622</b> of the receptacle <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the proximity sensor <b>640</b> includes a Hall Effect sensor, which detects magnetic field levels. In use, the electromagnet <b>606</b> is initially energized before being coupled to the receptacle <b>620</b>. The initial energization can be achieved, for example, when the adapter <b>608</b> is coupled to a power source (not shown) or when a touch sensor (not shown) or the like is activated by the user. The initial energization can be less than that necessary to magnetically couple the electromagnet <b>606</b> to the plate <b>622</b>. Once the plug <b>602</b> is moved in proximity to the receptacle <b>622</b>, the magnetic field associated with the initial energization of the electromagnet <b>606</b> is changed, which is subsequently detected by the Hall Effect sensor <b>640</b>. The sensor <b>640</b>, in turn, causes the energization of the electromagnet <b>606</b> to be increased to allow it to magnetically couple to the attraction plate <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>600</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated having an electromagnet <b>606</b> and fault detection circuitry <b>650</b>. Reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that are the same as those in other Figures represent like components between embodiments. As before, the electromagnet <b>606</b> is energized to magnetically couple with the attraction plate <b>626</b> of receptacle <b>620</b>, which can be ferromagnetic material or a permanent magnet. The fault detection circuitry <b>650</b> detects a fault event caused, for example, by a surge or spike in the power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The fault detection circuitry <b>650</b> can be similar to that commonly used in the art for power adapters. In one embodiment, for example, the fault detection circuitry <b>650</b> can include circuitry for detecting an over-current. In another embodiment, for example, the fault detection circuitry <b>650</b> can include circuitry for detecting an over-temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the fault detection circuitry <b>650</b> detects a fault event, the circuitry <b>650</b> can stop energizing the electromagnet <b>606</b> and allow the plug <b>602</b> to be released from the embodiment of the receptacle <b>620</b> having a ferromagnetic attraction plate <b>626</b>. Alternatively, the circuitry <b>650</b> can reverse the direction of current supplied through the electromagnet <b>606</b> so the electromagnet <b>606</b> is repelled by the polarity of the embodiment of the receptacle <b>620</b> having a permanent magnet on the attraction plate <b>626</b>. It will be appreciated that the electromagnet <b>606</b> and fault circuitry <b>650</b> can be positioned on the device <b>630</b> while the attraction plate can be positioned on the plug <b>602</b> of the connector <b>600</b> to achieve the same protection.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>600</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated having two electromagnets <b>606</b> and <b>660</b>. The plug <b>602</b> has the first electromagnet <b>606</b>, which is energized by the power adapter <b>608</b>. The receptacle <b>620</b> positioned in the device <b>630</b> has the second electromagnet <b>660</b>, which is power by an internal power supply <b>662</b>, such as a battery. The two electromagnets <b>606</b> and <b>660</b> have opposite polarities allowing them to be magnetically coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the adapter <b>608</b> includes fault detection circuitry <b>650</b>. When a fault is detected by fault detection circuitry <b>662</b>, the polarity of the first electromagnet <b>606</b> can be reversed by the circuitry <b>650</b> so that the first and second electromagnets <b>606</b> and <b>660</b> repel one another and actively prevent connection.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another embodiment, the adapter <b>608</b> includes circuitry <b>650</b> for identifying the adapter <b>608</b>. For example, the identification circuitry <b>650</b> can identify a type of electronic device to which it is intended to be connected or can even identify a specific device to which is can only be used. When a user intends to connect the plug <b>602</b> to the receptacle <b>620</b>, the first electromagnet <b>606</b> can be energized according to the techniques disclosed herein. However, the second electromagnet <b>660</b> can remain de-energized. When the user positions the plug <b>602</b> against the receptacle <b>620</b>, the signal path formed by contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b> allow the identification circuitry <b>650</b> to send a signal to the internal electronics <b>632</b> of the device, which can identify the adapter <b>608</b> being connected to the device <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the adapter <b>608</b> is intended for the device <b>630</b>, then the second electromagnet <b>660</b> can be energized with opposite polarity to couple with the first electromagnet <b>606</b>, or the second electromagnet <b>660</b> can remain de-energized while the first electromagnet <b>606</b> is simply allowed to magnetically couple with the ferromagnetic components of the de-energized electromagnet <b>660</b>. If, on the other hand, the adapter <b>608</b> is not intended for the device <b>630</b>, then the second electromagnet <b>660</b> can be energized with the same polarity to repel the first electromagnet <b>606</b> and actively prevent connection.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an embodiment of a magnetic connector <b>600</b> according to certain teachings of the present disclosure is illustrated having an electromagnet <b>606</b> and control circuitry <b>670</b>. In one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>670</b> includes a switch element, which receives a control signal from the internal electronics <b>632</b> of the device <b>630</b>. When the battery of the electronic device <b>630</b> is fully charged, the internal electronics <b>632</b> sends a control signal to the control circuitry <b>670</b> via the signal path formed by contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b>. Moreover, when the internal electronics <b>632</b> detects a fault, it can send a control signal to the control circuitry <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, one of the contacts <b>604</b> on the plug <b>602</b> and one of the contracts <b>624</b> on the receptacle <b>620</b> (preferably, the centrally located contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b>) can form a signal path between the device <b>630</b> and the adapter <b>608</b>. It is along such a signal path that the control signal indicating the fully charged battery is sent. When the signal for &#x201c;full charge&#x201d; is received, the control circuitry <b>670</b> causes its internal switch element to stop energization of the electromagnet <b>606</b>, and the plug <b>602</b> becomes decoupled from the receptacle <b>626</b>. If it is desirable to keep the plug <b>602</b> magnetically coupled, albeit slightly, to the receptacle <b>620</b> even after full charging of the battery, the plate <b>627</b> on the receptacle <b>620</b> can include a magnet (not shown) for maintaining at least some magnetic coupling with ferromagnetic material of the electromagnet <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment, the control circuitry <b>670</b> receives a control signal, which governs whether the adapter <b>608</b> associated with the control circuitry <b>670</b> can operate with the electronic device <b>630</b>. In this embodiment, the internal electronics <b>632</b> on the device <b>630</b> produces a control signal that identifies the device <b>630</b>, such as by its make or model. The control signal can be a digital signal, for example, identifying the device <b>630</b>. The control circuitry <b>670</b> in the adapter <b>608</b> is pre-configured to energize the electromagnet <b>606</b> only when the identifying control signal is received. To respond to the control signal, the control circuitry includes a switch element for controlling the electrical connection of the electromagnet <b>606</b> with its energizing source, and the circuitry includes a logic element for interpreting the control signal and activating the switch element.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, when a user positions the plug <b>602</b> against the receptacle <b>620</b> to connect them, the signal contacts <b>604</b> and <b>624</b> on the plug and receptacle <b>602</b> and <b>620</b> will make contact, allowing the internal electronics <b>632</b> of the device <b>630</b> to communicate its identifying control signal to the control circuitry <b>670</b> of the adapter <b>608</b>. If the circuitry <b>670</b> receives the correct signal, an internal switch within the circuitry causes the electromagnet <b>606</b> to be energized for coupling with the receptacle. Otherwise, the electromagnet will not be energized, and the plug <b>602</b> will not stay coupled to the receptacle <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Accordingly, the electromagnet <b>606</b> on the adapter <b>608</b> will only be energized for a particular model or type of device, which may prevent the possibility of a user inadvertently coupling an adapter with a specific power rating to a device requiring a different power rating. For example, harm to a computer can be prevented because the computer will not allowing itself to be connected to the wrong type of power adapter (e.g., one that supplies a higher voltage than the computer's specification). Furthermore, the control circuitry <b>670</b> and identification of the device <b>630</b> can be configured so that the device <b>630</b> will only draw power only from a particular power adapter or a group of power adapters. Such a configuration can be useful in various settings, such as a school or other public organization, to discourage theft.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In yet another embodiment, the control circuitry <b>670</b> includes a security system, which requires the user to enter a particular code or other identification. Without the entered code, the control circuitry <b>670</b> will not energize the electromagnet, and the plug <b>602</b> will not engage with the receptacle <b>620</b>.</p>
