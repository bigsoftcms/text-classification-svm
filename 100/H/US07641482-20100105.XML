<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrical connector with contacts on a top surface of an insulating housing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shown, a conventional electrical connector includes an insulating housing <b>1</b>&#x2032; and two contacts <b>2</b>&#x2032;. The housing is a rectangular frame. The contact in an L-like shape includes a main body <b>21</b>&#x2032; located on a top face of a lateral sidewall of the housing after the contact is assembled on the housing in a top to down direction, wherein two retaining portion <b>26</b>&#x2032; extending from an outer edge of the main body is inserted into and retained in corresponding slots <b>10</b>&#x2032; defined in the lateral sidewall. The retaining portion bents from the main body by a curved transition portion <b>25</b>&#x2032;. A resilient contacting portion <b>22</b>&#x2032; is perpendicular to the main body and upwardly-slantwise located above a longitudinal sidewall to mating with a speaker component. An abutting portion <b>23</b>&#x2032; on another end of the main body opposite to the contacting portion abuts against the stop face <b>11</b>&#x2032; on another longitudinal sidewall, thereby the contacts is stopped in the longitudinal direction. A soldering portion <b>24</b>&#x2032; adjacent to the contacting portion extends downwards from the main body. The contacts are assembled to the housing by an automatic machine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to continuing trend toward miniaturization and improved performance by the electronics industry, the housing and the contact become smaller. However, accurate position of the contacts to the slots and the automatic machine to the contact is difficult when assembling of the contacts, thereby forming a loose assembly of the contact and the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an improved electrical connector is desired to overcome the disadvantages of the prior arts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector with a contact, the contact is easily and fitly assembled in an insulating housing of the electrical connector.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve above-mentioned object, an electrical connector comprises an insulating housing comprising a longitudinal and a lateral wall defining a top face and at least one contact. The lateral wall defines a slot thereon. The contact comprises a main body located one the top face of the lateral wall and a contacting arm located above the longitudinal wall, a connecting portion extending from an inner edge of the main body and a retaining portion extending from an outer edge of the main body. The retaining portion is retained and received in the slot. A pressed portion laterally extends from the main body.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe a preferred embodiment of the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, an electrical connector embodying the present invention includes an insulating housing <b>1</b> and two contacts <b>2</b> (only one is shown in the figures and the two contacts are symmetrical). The housing is a rectangular frame with two parallel longitudinal walls <b>11</b> and two lateral walls <b>12</b> each having a top face <b>10</b>. The contact <b>2</b> in an L-like shape includes a main body <b>22</b> located on a top face <b>10</b> of the lateral sidewall <b>12</b> of the housing after the contact <b>2</b> is assembled on the housing in a top-to-down direction. A cantilevered resilient contacting arm <b>21</b> extending perpendicular from one end of the main body <b>22</b>, is located above the top face of the longitudinal wall <b>11</b> of the housing in an free end upward slant pattern. An abutting portion <b>23</b> extending from another end opposite to said one end of the main body <b>22</b>, is located on the top face of another longitudinal wall. The abutting portion <b>23</b> abuts against a step portion <b>14</b> integrally defined on the longitudinal wall <b>12</b>, which will further stop the contact from forward moving along the longitudinal wall. Two retaining portion <b>25</b> adjacent two ends of the main body <b>22</b> and bending from opposite edges opposite to where the contacting arm <b>21</b> extending, are retained in two corresponding slots <b>13</b> defined in the lateral wall <b>12</b>. The retaining portion <b>25</b> is mechanically connecting with the main body by a curved transition portion <b>24</b>. A connecting portion <b>26</b> extends downward from the inner edge of the main body for being soldered with a electronic wire.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slot <b>13</b> opens upward and outwards to communicate an exterior. One inner face adjacent to one end of the slot defines step portions forming a lower face <b>131</b> and an upper face <b>132</b> both facing upwardly. Another end defines a top face <b>130</b>. Two downward slant guiding faces <b>134</b> are formed in an inner side of the slot from the top face <b>10</b> of the housing. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first pressed portion <b>271</b> parallel projects outward from an outer lateral edge of the retaining portion <b>25</b> and a second pressed portion <b>272</b> parallel projects outward from an inner lateral edge of the retaining portion <b>25</b>, two adjacent second pressed portions <b>272</b> facing to each other. The tops of the two pressed portions are on a same lever while the bottom of the first pressed portion is higher than the second portion, in other word, the second portion is wider than the first pressed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During assembly the contact <b>2</b> to the slot <b>13</b>, the automotive machine clip the pressed portion <b>27</b> including the first and second pressed portions <b>271</b>, <b>272</b> to the slot <b>13</b>, and then press against the top faces <b>2710</b>, <b>2720</b> of pressed portions while a supporting tool goes through a passageway <b>121</b> defined in the middle of the lateral wall to upwards support on the main body of the contact, thereby retaining the contact in the slot <b>13</b>. The second pressed portion <b>272</b> abuts against the lower face <b>131</b> and the first pressed portion <b>271</b> abuts against the top face <b>130</b>. The upper face <b>132</b> leaves a predetermined room for the automotive machine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the disclosure is illustrative only, changes may be made in detail, especially in matter of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention.</p>
