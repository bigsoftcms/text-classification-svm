Here the first housing <b>122</b> and the second housing <b>124</b> do not cover the connector <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the first housing <b>122</b> and the second housing <b>124</b> are connected and form a containing space Si <b>0</b> and an opening. In particular, the opening is between the first connect edge <b>122</b><i>e </i>of the first housing <b>122</b> and the second connect edge <b>124</b><i>e </i>of the second housing <b>124</b>. The first connect edge <b>122</b><i>e </i>is located at the outermost of the first housing <b>122</b>, and the second connect edge <b>124</b><i>e </i>is located at the outermost of the second housing <b>124</b>. The third housing <b>126</b> is connected with the first connect edge <b>122</b><i>e </i>of the first housing <b>122</b> and the second connect edge <b>124</b><i>e </i>of the second housing <b>124</b> to cover the opening. In addition, a circuit board disposition region R<b>10</b> is disposed on the first housing <b>122</b>, the circuit board <b>110</b> is disposed in the containing space S<b>10</b> on the circuit board disposition region R<b>10</b>, and part of the circuit board <b>110</b> is exposed at the foregoing opening. The first side <b>1101</b> of the circuit board <b>110</b> is at the foregoing opening. On the other hand, the circuit board <b>110</b> and the second housing <b>124</b> may both at the second side <b>122</b><i>s </i>of the first housing <b>122</b>. The third housing <b>126</b> covers the first side <b>1101</b> of the circuit board <b>110</b>. In the present embodiment, the first housing <b>122</b>, the second housing <b>124</b>, and the third housing <b>126</b>, for example, cover the circuit board <b>110</b> all together; however, the present invention is not limited hereto. For example, if the electronic device <b>100</b> has a removable hard disk or a battery, then the first housing <b>122</b>, the second housing <b>124</b>, and the third housing <b>126</b> do not cover the circuit board <b>110</b> all together.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the electronic device <b>100</b> has, for example, a display module (not shown), such as an LCD module, electrically connected to the circuit board <b>110</b> for displaying images. In an embodiment, with a notebook computer as example, the display module is, for example, rotatablely connected to the first housing <b>122</b>, the second housing <b>124</b>, or the third housing <b>126</b>. In another embodiment, with flat panel computer as example, the display module is, for example, disposed on the first housing <b>122</b> and electrically connected to the circuit board <b>110</b> for displaying images. Besides, keyboard module and touch pad module (not shown) can be further disposed on the first housing <b>122</b>, and electrically connected to the circuit board <b>110</b> for users to input signals. In addition, the internal surfaces of the first housing <b>122</b>, the second housing <b>124</b>, and the third housing <b>126</b> respectively have a metal layer <b>140</b> for preventing electromagnetic interference. Wherein the metal layers <b>140</b> are, for example, in contact with each other and have ground terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A&#x2dc;2C</figref> again, the third housing <b>126</b> has at least one connector hole O<b>10</b>, and the connector <b>112</b> is at the connector hole O<b>10</b>. Besides, in the present embodiment, the third housing <b>126</b> can be divided into the fourth housing <b>126</b><i>a </i>and the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b</i>. However, in another embodiment, the third housing <b>126</b> can be one-time shaped. Here the third housing <b>126</b> is, for example, in L shape, which will be described below. The first housing <b>122</b>, the second housing <b>124</b>, and the fourth housing <b>126</b><i>a </i>can be connected to form an opening. In particular, the opening is between the edge <b>122</b><i>e </i>of the first housing <b>122</b> and the edge <b>126</b><i>e </i>of the fourth housing <b>126</b><i>a</i>. In addition, the first side <b>1101</b> of the circuit board <b>110</b> may be at the opening, and the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b </i>may cover the opening. The fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b</i>, for example, has the connector hole O<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is a perspective view of the fifth housing illustrated from a different angle as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b </i>has the connector hole O<b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, there are totally <b>6</b> kinds of connector holes O<b>10</b>; however, the number and type of connector hole O<b>10</b> are not limited in the present invention. The positions of the connector holes O<b>10</b> are formed correspondingly to that of the connectors <b>112</b> on the circuit board <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, the electronic device in the embodiment described above has at least following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">1. the area covered by the third housing <b>126</b> is approximately the same as the circuit board disposition region R<b>10</b>, thus, it is possible to open only the third housing <b>126</b> during maintenance to individually maintain or replace the circuit board <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the maintenance of electronic device <b>100</b> is made more convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">2. when new circuit board is replaced, only the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b </i>having the connector hole O<b>10</b> needs to be replaced if the new circuit board has different type of connector or different connector position. Since the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b </i>is in strip shape and it only occupies a small portion of all the housings, the cost for replacing the housings can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">3. when replacing or inspecting the connector <b>112</b>, the fourth housing <b>126</b><i>a </i>has to be disassembled first before disassembling the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, when replacing or inspecting the circuit board <b>110</b>, the fourth housing <b>126</b><i>a </i>has to be disassembled first before disassembling the fifth housing <b>126</b><i>b</i>. In the electronic device of the present invention, these two maintenance and inspections have similar steps of disassembling housings, thus, the mechanics can master the operations quickly even though there are up to 4 housings. In other words, the housings disassembly steps are very straightforward to mechanics and won't cause any misunderstanding.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in the present embodiment, the first housing <b>322</b> and the second housing <b>324</b> form a containing space S<b>30</b>, and the circuit board <b>310</b> is disposed in the containing space S<b>30</b>. Wherein the first width W<b>31</b> of the first housing <b>322</b> is, for example, greater than the second width W<b>32</b> of the second housing <b>324</b>. In such case, the first housing <b>322</b> and the second housing <b>324</b> do not cover the connector <b>312</b>. The circuit board <b>310</b> is, for example, disposed in the first housing <b>322</b>. The circuit board <b>310</b> has a first side <b>3101</b> and a second side <b>3102</b>, and the second side <b>3102</b> is connected to the first side <b>3101</b>.

Besides, the connector <b>312</b> is, for example, an I/O connector (not shown). Complicated disassembly procedure can be avoided when maintaining or replacing the circuit board <b>310</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. On the other hand, compared to the electronic device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the electronic device <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> has the one-time shaping third housing <b>326</b> which can reduce the cost of molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the difference between the electronic device <b>400</b> and the electronic device <b>300</b> is that the circuit board <b>410</b> of the electronic device <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is disposed between the first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b>, and the third housing <b>426</b> may be in strip shape. A first connect edge <b>422</b><i>e </i>is located at the outermost of the first housing <b>422</b>, and a second connect edge <b>424</b><i>e </i>is located at the outermost of the second housing <b>424</b>. The third housing <b>426</b> is connected with the first connect edge <b>422</b><i>e </i>of the first housing <b>422</b> and the second connect edge <b>424</b><i>e </i>of the second housing <b>424</b> to cover the opening therebetween. The circuit board <b>410</b> has at least one connector <b>412</b> on at least a first side <b>4101</b>. Wherein the connector <b>412</b> is, for example, an I/O connector. The first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b> are connected to each other and form a containing space S<b>40</b> and an opening. In particular, the opening is between the first connect edge <b>422</b><i>e </i>of the first housing <b>422</b> and the second connect edge <b>424</b><i>e </i>of the second housing <b>424</b>. The circuit board <b>410</b> is disposed in the containing space S<b>40</b>, and part of the circuit board <b>410</b> is exposed at the foregoing opening.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, at least a portion of the circuit board <b>410</b> is between the first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b>, and the first side <b>4101</b> of the circuit board <b>410</b> is at outside of the first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b>. However, the present invention is not limited hereto; in other words, the whole circuit board <b>410</b> may be between the first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b>. In this case, the first width W<b>41</b> of the first housing <b>422</b> is substantially equal to the second width W<b>42</b> of the second housing <b>424</b>, and the first housing <b>422</b> and the second housing <b>424</b> do not cover the connector <b>412</b>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since only the third housing <b>426</b> needs to be disassembled for maintaining the connector <b>412</b>, the maintenance of connector <b>412</b> becomes very convenient. The structure of the electronic device <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> makes the maintenance of the connector <b>412</b> to be more convenient. Besides, if new circuit board has to be replaced and the new circuit board has different type of connector or different connector position, only the third housing <b>426</b> having the connector hole O<b>40</b> needs to be replaced. The third housing <b>426</b> is in strip shape and only occupies a small portion of all the housings, thus, the cost of housing replacement can be reduced. Moreover, the electronic device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> has 4 housings while the electronic device <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> has only 3 housings, the less the number of housings is, the less the cost of molding process is.</p>
