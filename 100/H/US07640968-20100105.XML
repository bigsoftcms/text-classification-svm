<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat dissipation device for computer add-on cards and particularly a heat dissipation device mounted onto a graphics card for dissipating heat generated by the graphics card.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to enable desktop and other computers to rapidly process graphics and game technology, add-on units, generally referred to as &#x201c;graphics cards&#x201d; are often installed in computer devices. Such cards comprise a separate processor, called a GPU (graphics processor unit). When a GPU operates at high speed in a computer enclosure, its temperature is greatly increased. It is desirable to dissipate the heat quickly, for example by using a heat dissipation device attached to the GPU in the enclosure. This allows the GPU and other electronic components in the enclosure to function within their normal operating temperature ranges, thereby assuring the quality of data management, storage and transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional heat dissipation device comprises a heat sink and a pair of heat pipes. The heat sink comprises a base and a plurality of fins extending from the base. The base has a bottom surface attached to an electronic component and defines two grooves at a top surface opposite the bottom surface. Each heat pipe has a heat-receiving portion accommodated in one of the grooves and a pair of heat-discharging portions extending from opposite free ends of the heat-receiving portion and inserted into the top fins. The base absorbs heat produced by the electronic component and transfers the heat directly to the fins through the heat pipes. By the provision of the heat pipes heat dissipation efficiency of the heat dissipation device is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, due to structural limitations, the contact area between the heat pipes and the fins is limited, which results in the heat dissipation efficiency by the conventional heat dissipation device still cannot meet the increasing heat removal requirements of the modern heat-generating electronic devices. Furthermore, when such a conventional heat dissipation device is used to dissipate heat from the GPU of a graphics card, it cannot be equipped with an electric fan to generate an airflow forcibly expelling the heat from the fins, since a space between the graphics card a neighboring card is so limited that to install the electric fan on the fins is impracticable.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a heat dissipation device comprises a base, a heat radiator mounted on the base, and two heat pipes connecting the base and the heat radiator. The base has a bottom face adapted for contacting with a heat-generating electronic component. The heat pipes each comprise an evaporating portion embedded in the base and a condensing portion extending from an end of the evaporating portion. The heat radiator comprises first and second fin assemblies each having an arc-shaped configuration with two contacting faces at two ends thereof, the condensing portions of the heat pipes are sandwiched between the contacting faces by the first and second fin assemblies, and a round opening is enclosed by the first and second fin assemblies. An electrical fan is received in the opening and generates a forced airflow through the fin assemblies when the fan is in operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a heat dissipating device (not labeled) in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The heat dissipation device includes a base <b>10</b>, two heat spreaders <b>30</b>, two L-shaped heat pipes <b>20</b> thermally connecting the base <b>10</b> and the heat spreaders <b>30</b>, a hollow heat radiator <b>40</b> comprising a first fin assembly <b>42</b> and a second fin assembly <b>44</b> which together sandwich the heat pipes <b>20</b> and the heat spreaders <b>30</b> therebetween, and an axial flow fan <b>50</b> mounted in the heat radiator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The base <b>10</b> has a bottom face (not labeled) for engaging with a GPU (not shown) mounted on a printed circuit board of a graphics card <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to absorb heat therefrom, and a top face <b>14</b> having two adjoining grooves <b>16</b>. Two mounting brackets <b>12</b> each with a pair of ears <b>13</b> are attached to opposite bottom sides of the base <b>10</b>. The base <b>10</b> thermally engages with the GPU mounted on the printed circuit board by extending four fasteners <b>18</b> through the four ears <b>13</b> to threadedly engage with a retainer (not shown) attached to a bottom side of the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each heat pipe <b>20</b> is L-shaped, and comprises a horizontal evaporating portion <b>22</b> and a vertical condensing portion <b>24</b> extending upwards from an outside end of the evaporating portion <b>22</b>. The evaporating portions <b>22</b> of the heat pipes <b>20</b> are soldered in the grooves <b>16</b> of the base <b>10</b>. The condensing portions <b>24</b> are positioned at opposite sides of the base <b>10</b> in such a manner that the heat absorbed by the heat pipes <b>20</b> can be evenly transferred to the whole of the radiator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each heat spreader <b>30</b> is made of highly heat-conductive metal, such as copper or aluminum, and has two opposite faces <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> for engaging with the heat radiator <b>40</b>. Each heat spreader <b>30</b> defines a groove <b>36</b> at the face <b>32</b> thereof. The condensing portion <b>24</b> of each heat pipe <b>20</b> is received in the groove <b>36</b>. A depth of each groove <b>36</b> is substantially equal to an outer diameter of each heat pipe <b>20</b>. As such, after the condensing portion <b>24</b> of each heat pipe <b>20</b> is positioned in the groove <b>36</b>, an exposed outer surface of each heat pipe <b>20</b> is coplanar with the face <b>32</b> of the heat spreader <b>30</b>. The two faces <b>32</b> having the grooves <b>36</b> of the heat spreaders <b>30</b> are placed back to back.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The heat radiator <b>40</b> comprises the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the second fin assembly <b>44</b>. The first and the second assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> each have a substantially arc-shaped configuration. The first and the second assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are approximately symmetrical and cooperatively define a central opening <b>400</b> therebetween. The opening <b>400</b> is round in shape. The first and the second assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> each have two perpendicular contacting faces <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> at two ends thereof. Two receiving space are defined between the faces <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> of the first and the second assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> for receiving the heat pipes <b>20</b> and the heat spreaders <b>30</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first and second fin assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> respectively comprise a plurality of first fins <b>420</b> and second fins <b>440</b>. The fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> are approximately semi-annular and parallel to the base <b>10</b>. The fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> have two ends (not labeled). The fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> form flange <b>422</b>, <b>442</b> perpendicularly and downwardly extending from edges at the ends. The flanges <b>422</b>, <b>442</b> separate the fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> at uniform intervals. The flanges <b>422</b>, <b>442</b> respectively form clasps <b>426</b>, <b>427</b> thereon. The fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> respectively snappingly clasp with each other via the clasps <b>426</b>, <b>427</b>. The flanges <b>422</b>, <b>442</b> of the fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> respectively form the contacting faces <b>43</b>, <b>45</b>. Two ears <b>428</b> extend from the outside edge of each first fin <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and second fin assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> respectively have a bottom fin <b>4200</b>, <b>4400</b> located close to the base <b>10</b>. The bottom fins <b>4200</b>, <b>4400</b> each have a substantially semi-circular configuration. After the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the second fin assembly <b>44</b> are assembled, a bottom of the opening <b>400</b> is sealed by the bottom fins <b>4200</b>, <b>4400</b> for receiving the fan <b>50</b>. The heat radiator <b>40</b> has a plurality of channels defined between the first and second fins <b>420</b>, <b>440</b> communicating the opening <b>400</b> of the heat radiator <b>40</b> with an exterior of the radiator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fan <b>50</b> is secured in the opening <b>400</b> of the radiator <b>40</b> by a bracket <b>52</b> mounted on the heat spreaders <b>30</b>. A main axis of the fan <b>50</b> is vertical to the extension direction of the channels of the heat radiator <b>40</b>. The bracket <b>52</b> comprises an annular base <b>520</b>, two L-shaped connecting portions <b>522</b> extending outwardly and upwardly from two opposite edges of the base <b>520</b> and two mounting portions <b>524</b> outwardly and horizontally extending from the top edges of the connecting portions <b>522</b>. Each of the mounting portions <b>524</b> defines a through hole <b>5240</b> therein. Screws (not labeled) extend through the through holes <b>5240</b> and engage with top portions of the heat spreaders <b>30</b> to secure the bracket <b>52</b> to the heat spreaders <b>30</b>. The base <b>520</b> of the bracket <b>52</b> defines three screw holes <b>528</b> therein. The fan <b>50</b> comprises three legs <b>54</b> defining three through holes <b>540</b> corresponding to the screw holes <b>528</b> of the base <b>520</b>. Screws (not labeled) extend through the through holes <b>540</b> and engage in the screw holes <b>528</b> of the base <b>520</b> to secure the fan <b>50</b> to the bracket <b>52</b>. Thus, the fan <b>50</b> is secured in the opening <b>400</b> of the heat radiator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heat dissipating device is installed onto the graphics card <b>60</b> for dissipating the heat generated by the GPU (not shown) on the graphics card <b>60</b>. The bottom of the base <b>10</b> of the heat dissipation device contacts a top surface of the GPU. When the GPU is in use, the base <b>10</b> absorbs heat generated by the GPU. Then the heat accumulated on the base <b>10</b> is absorbed by the evaporating portions <b>22</b> of the heat pipes <b>20</b> and transferred to the condensing portions <b>24</b>. The heat absorbed by the condensing portions <b>24</b> is transferred to the heat radiator <b>40</b> via the heat spreaders <b>30</b>. Thus the heat generated by the GPU can be quickly and evenly transferred to the whole of the heat radiator <b>40</b>. An airflow generated by the fan <b>50</b> passes through the channels of the first and second fin assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> to take away the heat absorbed by the radiator <b>40</b>. The fan <b>50</b> is mounted closed to the first and second fin assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> in a manner such that the airflow is strong enough to pass through the first and second fin assemblies <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>; heat dissipation efficiency of the heat dissipation device is improved accordingly. The airflow also takes away heat from the other heat-generating electronic components (not shown) beside the GPU.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the preferred embodiment, the fan <b>50</b> is an axial flow fan. The fin <b>4200</b> of the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the fin <b>4400</b> of the second fin assembly <b>44</b> enclose the bottom of the radiator <b>40</b> to lead the airflow generated by the fan <b>50</b> to pass through the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the second fin assembly <b>44</b>. When the fan <b>50</b> is a centrifugal fan, the airflow generated by the fan <b>50</b> can directly flow through the channels of the radiator <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the fin <b>4200</b> of the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the fin <b>4400</b> of the second fin assembly <b>44</b> can be omitted when the fan <b>50</b> is a centrifugal fan.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, the heat spreaders <b>30</b> also can be omitted. The heat pipes <b>20</b> can be flattened and directly contact the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the second fin assembly <b>44</b>, or the first fin assembly <b>42</b> and the second fin assembly <b>44</b> can define two grooves (not shown) in the contacting faces <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> thereof for directly receiving the condensing portions <b>24</b> of the heat pipes <b>20</b>. The two L-shaped heat pipes <b>20</b> can combine to form a U-shaped heat pipe comprising an evaporating portion and two condensing portions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p>
