<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pixel with a photosensor and a transfer transistor having a split transfer gate. A first section of the transfer gate is connectable to a first voltage source while a second section of the transfer gate is connectable to a second voltage source. Thus, during a charge integration period of a photosensor, the two sections of the transfer gate may be oppositely biased to decrease dark current while controlling blooming of electrons within and out of the pixel cell. During charge transfer the two gate sections may be commonly connected to a positive voltage sufficient to transfer charge from the photosensor to a floating diffusion region.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to transfer transistor technology, for use in imager pixels.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">CMOS image sensors are increasingly being used as low cost imaging devices. A CMOS image sensor circuit includes a focal plane array of pixel cells, each one of the cells includes a photosensor, such as e.g., a photogate, photoconductor, or photodiode having an associated charge accumulation region within a substrate for accumulating photo-generated charge. Each pixel cell may include a transistor for transferring charge from the charge accumulation region to a sensing node, and a transistor for resetting the sensing node to a predetermined charge level prior to charge transference. The pixel cell may also include a source follower transistor for receiving and amplifying charge from the sensing node and an access transistor, for controlling the readout of the cell contents from the source follower transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a CMOS image sensor, the active elements of a pixel cell perform the necessary functions of: (1) photon to charge conversion; (2) accumulation of image charge; (3) transfer of charge to the sensing node accompanied by charge amplification; (4) resetting the sensing node to a known state before the transfer of charge to it; (5) selection of a pixel for readout; and (6) output and amplification of a signal representing pixel charge from the sensing node.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">CMOS image sensors of the type discussed above are generally known as discussed, for example, in Nixon et al., &#x201c;256&#xd7;256 CMOS Active Pixel Sensor Camera-on-a-Chip,&#x201d; IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 31(12), pp. 2046-2050 (1996); and Mendis et al., &#x201c;CMOS Active Pixel Image Sensors,&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. 41(3), pp. 452-453 (1994). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,177,333 and 6,204,524, which describe the operation of conventional CMOS image sensors and are assigned to Micron Technology, Inc., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A top-down view of a conventional CMOS pixel cell <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The illustrated CMOS pixel cell <b>10</b> is a four transistor (4T) cell. The CMOS pixel cell <b>10</b> generally comprises a photo-conversion device <b>13</b>, e.g., a photodiode, for generating and collecting charge in response to light incident on the pixel cell <b>10</b>, and a transfer transistor having a gate <b>7</b> for transferring photoelectric charges from the photo-conversion device <b>13</b> to a sensing node, which is typically a floating diffusion region <b>3</b>. The floating diffusion region <b>3</b> is electrically connected to the gate <b>27</b> of an output source follower transistor. The pixel cell <b>10</b> also includes a reset transistor having a gate <b>17</b> for resetting the floating diffusion region <b>3</b> to a predetermined voltage; and a row select transistor having a gate <b>37</b> for outputting a signal from the source follower transistor <b>27</b> to an output terminal in response to an address signal on gate <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the pixel cell <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, taken along line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>&#x2032;, showing the photo-conversion device <b>13</b> constructed as a photodiode, transfer transistor having a gate <b>7</b> and reset transistor having a gate <b>17</b>. The CMOS pixel cell <b>10</b> has a photo-conversion device <b>13</b> that may be formed as a pinned photodiode. The illustrated photodiode has a p-n-p construction comprising a p-type surface layer <b>5</b> and an n-type photodiode charge collection region <b>14</b> within a p-type substrate <b>2</b>. The photodiode <b>13</b> is adjacent to and partially underneath the gate <b>7</b> of the transfer transistor. The reset transistor gate <b>17</b> is on a side of the transfer transistor gate <b>7</b> opposite the photodiode <b>13</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reset transistor includes a source/drain region <b>32</b>, which is adjacent an isolation region <b>9</b>. The floating diffusion region <b>3</b> is located between the gates <b>7</b>, <b>17</b> of the transfer and reset transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the CMOS pixel cell <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, electrons are generated by light incident on the photodiode <b>13</b> and are stored in the n-type photodiode region <b>14</b>. These charges are transferred to the floating diffusion region <b>3</b> by the transfer transistor when the transfer transistor gate <b>7</b> is turned on. The source follower transistor produces an output signal from the transferred charges which are stored in the floating diffusion region <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One common problem associated with conventional imager pixel cells, such as pixel cell <b>10</b>, is dark current, that is, current generated as a photodiode signal in the absence of light. Dark current may be caused by many different factors, including: photodiode junction leakage, leakage along isolation edges, transistor sub-threshold leakage, drain induced barrier lower leakage, gate induced drain leakage, trap assisted tunneling, and pixel fabrication defects. One example of a defect is an interstitial vacancy state in the charge carrier-depletion region. This defect causes increased thermal generation of electron-hole pairs, which may be collected in the photodiode <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and effectively lower overall image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The area directly under the edge of the transfer transistor gatestack <b>17</b> is a significant source of dark current. The n-type accumulation region <b>14</b> of photodiode <b>13</b> is formed close to the surface of the substrate <b>2</b> under the transfer gatestack <b>17</b> in order to reduce charge lag. This causes the depletion region created during an integration period for the pixel cell <b>10</b>, and being associated with the n-type accumulation region <b>14</b> and the p-type surface region <b>5</b>, to also be close to the surface of the substrate <b>2</b> in this area. The presence of the depletion region in an area that already has defects causes large numbers of thermally-created electron-hole pairs to be present in this area near the transfer transistor gatestack <b>17</b> edge. When the photodiode <b>13</b> is reset with a reset voltage applied on the reset gate <b>17</b>, a reverse bias electric field sweeps the thermally created holes into the p-type surface region <b>5</b> and the thermally created charge carriers over to the n-type collection area <b>14</b> of the photodiode <b>13</b>. These thermally generated charge carriers increase the unwanted dark current for image pixel cell <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One possible solution to reducing the dark current generation underneath the transfer transistor gatestack is to apply a negative voltage on the transfer transistor's gate. The negative voltage attracts electron-hole pairs to the surface, decreasing the depletion region there and effectively covering the interstitial vacancy state. Accordingly, with a negative voltage applied to the transfer transistor gate, thermally generated electron-hole pairs will likely recombine before the photodiode can collect them. This solution, however, tends to aggravate another problem, referred to as blooming. Blooming occurs when the storage capacity of the photodiode is full and electrons are still being generated even though the photodiode is full. The extra electrons can bloom to several locations. The extra electrons may attempt to diffuse by jumping across isolation barriers into adjacent pixels, corrupting their signals. Alternatively, the electrons may travel through the substrate and be collected in other areas of the pixel or in periphery circuit devices. The floating diffusion region is the most desirable place for the extra electrons to be collected. The floating diffusion region has considerable capacity to store these stray electrons during imager operation and the signal on the floating diffusion region is cleared or reset before the pixel signal is actually read.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Positively biasing the transfer transistor gate <b>7</b> makes extra electrons more likely to bloom through the transfer transistor to the floating diffusion region <b>3</b>. However, applying a negative bias to the transfer transistor gate <b>7</b>, which is desirable to prevent dark current penetration, makes it more difficult for the extra electrons to bloom to the floating diffusion region <b>3</b>, thus causing blooming into other undesirable regions of a pixel or adjacent pixels. Moreover, as suggested above, a positively biased transfer transistor gate <b>7</b> increases the dark current as a result of a larger depletion region under the transfer transistor gate <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, a pixel having a decreased dark current without negative blooming effects is desired. Also needed is a simple method of fabricating and operating such a pixel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention, as described in various exemplary embodiments, provides a pixel with a transfer transistor having a split transfer gate. A first section of the transfer gate is connectable to a first voltage source while a second section of the transfer gate is connectable to a second voltage source. Thus, during a charge integration period of a photosensor, the two sections of the transfer gate may be oppositely biased to decrease dark current while controlling blooming of electrons within and out of the pixel. During charge transfer the two gate sections may be commonly connected to a positive voltage sufficient to transfer charge from the photosensor to a floating diffusion region.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the first and second gate sections are located adjacent one another, over a gate oxide layer, and are separated by an isolation region.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof and illustrate specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like reference numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The terms &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; and &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; are to be understood as including silicon, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), and silicon-on-nothing (SON) technology, doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial layers of silicon supported by a base semiconductor foundation, and other semiconductor structures.

In addition, the semiconductor need not be silicon-based, but could be based on silicon-germanium, germanium, or gallium-arsenide.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;pixel&#x201d; or &#x201c;pixel cell&#x201d; refers to a picture element unit cell containing a photo-conversion device and transistors for converting electromagnetic radiation to an electrical signal. For purposes of illustration, a portion of a representative pixel cell is illustrated in the figures and description herein, and typically fabrication of all pixel cells in an image sensor will proceed concurrently and in a similar fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional and partial schematic circuit view of a pixel cell <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The pixel cell <b>100</b> has a split transfer gate electrode, having two-sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, as a part of transfer transistor <b>107</b>. As shown, both of the two sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of the transfer gate electrode are located above a gate oxide layer <b>104</b> and beneath an insulating cap layer <b>110</b>. During imager use, the two sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of the gate electrode may be respectively connected to a control circuit <b>131</b> for controlling the application of a respective first and second voltage potential V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the exemplary pixel cell <b>100</b>, the transfer gate of the transfer transistor <b>107</b> is located between a photodiode <b>113</b> and a floating diffusion region <b>103</b>. The photodiode <b>113</b> is illustratively a p-n-p photodiode, comprising a p-type surface region <b>105</b> located over an n-type accumulation region <b>114</b>, in a p-type substrate <b>102</b>. The invention may also be utilized, however, with other photosensitive elements and is not limited to the layout of the illustrated photodiode <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The transfer transistor <b>107</b> acts to transfer accumulated photo-charges from the n-type accumulation region <b>114</b> to the floating diffusion region <b>103</b>. A reset transistor <b>117</b> is located on an opposite side of the floating diffusion region <b>103</b> from the transfer transistor <b>107</b>. A source/drain region <b>132</b> is located in the substrate <b>102</b> on a second side of the reset transistor <b>117</b> and is capable of receiving a supply voltage V<sub>aa-pix</sub>. Adjacent the source drain region is a shallow trench isolation (STI) region <b>109</b>. A similar STI region <b>109</b> is constructed on the other side of the pixel cell as well, adjacent the photodiode region <b>113</b> to provide isolation for the pixel cell <b>100</b>. The floating diffusion region <b>103</b> is also electrically connected to the gate of a source follower transistor <b>127</b> having a drain coupled to V<sub>aa-pix</sub>, which creates a voltage signal based on stored charge on the floating diffusion region <b>103</b>. A row select transistor <b>137</b> has a drain connected to the source of the source follower transistor <b>127</b> for selectively reading out the pixel signal to a column line.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>150</b> of operating the exemplary pixel cell <b>100</b>. An integration period begins at step <b>201</b> as light is applied to the pixel cell <b>100</b> to capture an image. This can be done using any known method for beginning an integration period, such as the use of a mechanical or electronic shutter. As shown in steps <b>202</b>A and <b>202</b>B during the integration period, the control circuit <b>131</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) applies a first voltage V<sub>1 </sub>to a terminal at the first section <b>106</b> of the transfer gate electrode, and a second voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is applied to a terminal at the second section <b>108</b> of the transfer gate electrode. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is a slightly negative voltage so that the depletion region is pulled away from the surface of the silicon near the edge of the transfer gate of transfer transistor <b>107</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The first voltage V<sub>1 </sub>may be in the range of about &#x2212;0.1 to about &#x2212;1.0 volts. At the same time (<b>202</b>B), a slightly positive voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is applied to the second section <b>108</b> of the transfer transistor gate electrode. The slightly positive-biased second section <b>108</b> acts to attract mobile electrons under the transistor gate and serves to create a path for electrons, which might otherwise cause blooming, to flow to the floating diffusion region <b>103</b>, rather than to undesired areas of pixel <b>100</b> or to adjacent pixels. The second voltage V<sub>2 </sub>may be in the range of about +0.1 to about +1.0 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, for performing charge transfer, at step <b>203</b>, both sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of the gate electrode are biased with the same, positive voltage in order to turn on the transfer transistor to transfer the generated charges from the accumulation region <b>114</b> to the floating diffusion region <b>103</b>. Thus during charge transfer, the transfer transistor <b>107</b> acts as one gatestack; in contrast with during an integration period, when the transfer transistor <b>107</b> acts as though it has two separately controlled gatestacks. In step <b>204</b>, charges transferred to floating diffusion region <b>103</b> are applied to the gate of source follower transistor <b>127</b> which produces a pixel output signal that is read out through row select transistor <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5F</figref> depict one exemplary method of making a pixel cell <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention, showing a cross-sectional view of part of pixel cell <b>100</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an isolation region <b>109</b> is formed at least partially in an n-well region of a substrate <b>102</b>. The isolation region <b>109</b> may be formed using any known isolation forming techniques such as STI or LOCOS. At a top surface of the substrate <b>102</b>, a layer of gate oxide material <b>104</b> is deposited. The gate oxide material <b>104</b> may be any suitable dielectric material, such as, for example, silicon dioxide. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a conductive layer <b>168</b> is formed over the gate oxide layer <b>104</b>. The conductive layer <b>168</b> material may be any type of suitable electrode material, such as doped polysilicon. A photoresist mask/etch step is next performed to eliminate the gate oxide and conductive material everywhere except for the area where the gatestacks for transistors (<b>107</b>, <b>117</b>) are to be formed. A second mask/etch step may then be performed so that the conductive layer <b>168</b> for the transfer transistor <b>107</b> gatestack is split into a first <b>106</b> and a second <b>108</b> section, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An insulating material, such as a tetraethyl orthosilicate (&#x201c;TEOS&#x201d;) layer is formed over the surface of the substrate <b>102</b> and gatestacks. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, a photoresist mask/etch step is performed to eliminate the TEOS layer everywhere except over the gatestacks. In order to reduce the resistance between the electrode sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, an implant of phosphorus ions into the TEOS isolation region <b>110</b> between the gate electrode sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be used. An implant dose of 2e<sup>12 </sup>atoms per cm<sup>3 </sup>may be sufficient depending on the type of materials used and the spacing between the electrode sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, masked ion implants are selectively introduced into the substrate to form a large p-well. Appropriate ion implants are then utilized to form an n-type accumulation region <b>114</b> on one side of the transfer transistor <b>107</b>, and an n-type diffusion region <b>103</b> on the other side. An n-type source drain region <b>132</b> is also created near the surface of the substrate <b>102</b> for the reset transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, a surface p-type region <b>105</b> is created by implanting ions into the area of the substrate <b>102</b> over the accumulation region <b>114</b>. An oxide layer <b>111</b> is formed over the top of the substrate <b>102</b>, thereby creating oxide spacers on each transistor gatestack which may be etched away except at the sides and top of the transistor gatestacks. At this stage, the pixel cell <b>100</b> is essentially complete. Additional processing steps may be used to form insulating, photo device shielding, and light shielding layers, as desired. For example, a BPSG layer may be formed over the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> structure, upon which ILD and metallization layers are formed as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> show top-down views of pixel cells <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> in accordance with other exemplary embodiments of the invention. The only difference between these alternative embodiments and the first exemplary embodiment of pixel cell <b>100</b> is the location and arrangement of the transfer transistor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a second exemplary pixel cell <b>200</b>, which has two distinct electrode regions <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> separated by an isolation region <b>210</b>. Each electrode section <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> being located at an angle relative to the photodiode <b>113</b>, but parallel to one another. In accordance with one design of this second exemplary embodiment, the first electrode section <b>206</b> is thicker in width than the second electrode section as shown by the relative thicknesses T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. For example, the first electrode section may be approximately 0.3 microns wide and spaced apart from the second electrode section <b>208</b> by 0.2 microns. The second electrode section <b>208</b> may be approximately 0.2 microns wide in this exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary pixel cell <b>300</b> constructed in accordance with a third exemplary embodiment. Pixel cell <b>300</b> has a first electrode section <b>306</b> adapted for connection to one voltage source separated by isolation regions <b>310</b> from a second electrode section <b>308</b> for connection to a second voltage source. In this embodiment, the second electrode section <b>308</b> is sandwiched between the first section <b>306</b>. Specifically, the second electrode section <b>308</b> has the same width as the first electrode section <b>306</b> and effectively creates three electrode sections, two sections <b>306</b> connectable to a first voltage source, and the third <b>308</b> connectable to a second voltage source. In operation of this exemplary pixel cell <b>300</b>, the edges of the transfer gate (first electrode section <b>306</b>) are negatively biased to clear out generation of dark current from the area in the photodiode region <b>113</b> near the edge of the transfer gatestack edge, where it can be the most problematic. The middle of the transfer gatestack is the second electrode section <b>308</b> which is adapted to receive a positive voltage to provide blooming protection for electrons out of the photodiode region <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a fourth exemplary embodiment of a pixel cell <b>400</b> which has two electrode sections <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, running parallel to one another along the length of the photodiode region <b>113</b>. The two electrode sections <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> of this embodiment are separated by an isolation region <b>410</b>. Finally, a fifth exemplary embodiment of a pixel cell <b>500</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Pixel cell <b>500</b> has a second electrode section <b>508</b> within the first electrode section <b>506</b>, again separated by a thin isolation region <b>510</b>. Unlike the third exemplary embodiment of this invention, however, the width of this second electrode section <b>508</b> is less than the width of the first electrode section <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second through fifth exemplary embodiments of the invention are constructed using similar fabrication steps discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5F</figref>. Also similar to the exemplary pixel cell <b>100</b> above, the electrode sections for the split transfer gate electrodes for the second through fifth exemplary cells may be formed of any materials known in the art of transistor fabrication. Preferably, phosphorus ion implants are utilized in the isolation regions <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>510</b> to increase the performance of the gates.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The exemplary pixels of the present invention can be used in a pixel array <b>240</b> of an imager device <b>318</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.
