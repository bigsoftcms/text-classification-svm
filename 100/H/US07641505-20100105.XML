<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrical connector assembly, and more particularly to an electrical connector assembly with a heat dissipating device to efficiently dissipating heat generated from a CPU (Central Process Unit) mounted within the socket assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,848 issued to Lai on Mar. 3, 1998 discloses a typical connector socket, and which is generally referred to as a ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket. In general, the socket includes a base with a plurality of contacts assembled therein, and a cover moveably attached to the base. A lever with a cam mechanism is arranged between the base and cover to drive the cover from a first position to a second position. When the lever is located in a vertical position, the cover is located at the first position, in which a hole in the cover is completely in aligned with a corresponding passageway in the base. In this position, pins of the CPU can be inserted from the cover into the passageway without any engagement with the contact. When the CPU is properly seated on the cover, then the lever is moved from the vertical position to a horizontal position, and simultaneously driving the cover from the first position to the second position. During this process, the pins of the CPU are then in contact with the contact within the base. The Lai '848 is specially directed to a desk-top computer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">CPU socket used on notebook is substantially similar to what is used on the desktop computer, and the only difference is on the lever used on '848 patent was replaced by a screw with a cam mechanism. When the screw is driven or rotated, the cover is driven to move along the base, therefore the pins of the CPU are then in contact with the contact within the base, and no detailed description is given here.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,001,197 issued to Shirai on Feb. 21, 2006 discloses another type of socket, and which can be generally called LGA (Land Grid Array) socket. The original pins type of chip occupies more space on the bottom surface of the CPU. In order to increase input/output speed, conductive pads are introduced to replace the pins so as to directly and electrically contact with contact terminals within the socket. No doubt, the speed is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As clearly shown in Figures of Shirai '197, it is different configuration from to what Lai '848 discloses. The socket generally includes a metal stiffener with a housing securely supported therein. Then a metal clip is pivotally assembled to the stiffener. On the other hand, the clip is pivotally assembled to one side of the stiffener and when the clip is closed to the stiffener, the lever has a cam which can lock the clip to a closed position. By this arrangement, the CPU is seated on the housing before the clip is closed, and then the clip will tightly press the CPU toward the housing for ensuring proper electrical connection therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Shirai '197 can be applied to the desktop computer for which has more room for the operation of the lever, while it is almost impossible to apply Shirai '197 directly to the notebook in view of its compact, and thin space.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another factor to be considered is the configuration of the CPU. The CPU generally includes a substrate and a die mounted upon the substrate. Even the CPU is rigid, it is still vulnerable to deform or warp for downward force applied thereon is not evenly distributed. In Shirai '197 patent, the die is not pressed by the clip which has a window for it. The die is in direct contact with a heat sink. As a result, when applying the so-called LGA socket to notebook, how to provide a mechanism functionally similar to Shirai '197, while keep downward force evenly distributes to both die and substrate, is a motive for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The configuration of heat sink is another factor to be considered. Typically, the heat sink device includes a bottom plate and a plurality of parallel heat sink clip disposed on the bottom plate. As the heat sink device generally has a big volume, it applied to the desktop computer is ok, while it is almost impossible to apply to the notebook in view of its compact and thin space.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is need to supply an improved electrical connector assembly with a heat dissipating device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector assembly with a heat dissipate device which can dissipate heat for the CPU and exert a downward force to the CPU to prevent the CPU warp.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the object set forth, a heat dissipating device adapted to physically in contact with an electrical package disposed on a socket connector comprises a load plate having a substantially rectangular configuration defining a central opening having a first length and a first width and a heat plate having longitudinal sides and traversal ends. A heat plate has a heat pipe attached thereon and arranged such that the heat plate is disposed under the load plate, while the heat pipe is arranged above the load plate when rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to further achieve the object set forth, an electrical connector assembly comprises a socket, a load plate disposed upon the socket assembly, a heat plate and a heat pipe. The load plate has a substantially rectangular configuration defining a central opening having a first length and a first width. A heat plate with a heat pipe attached thereon forms an entity heat sink, and assembles the heat sink to the load plate such that the load plate is clamped by the heat pipe and heat plate.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electrical connector assembly of the present invention is used to a printed circuit board <b>60</b> and comprises an electrical connector <b>20</b> mounted on the printed circuit board <b>60</b>, an electrical package <b>30</b> received in the electrical connector <b>20</b> and a heat dissipating device disposed on the electrical package <b>30</b>. The heat dissipating device comprises a heat sink <b>40</b> and a load plate <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electrical connector <b>20</b> electrically connected with the electrical package <b>30</b> and the printed circuit board <b>60</b> comprises a substantially rectangular insulative housing <b>201</b> with a cavity <b>202</b> and a plurality of contacts (not shown) received in the cavity <b>202</b>. The contacts engage with the electrical package <b>30</b> at a top end thereof and solder to the printed circuit board <b>60</b> at a bottom end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The electrical package <b>30</b> comprises a substrate <b>301</b> and a die <b>302</b> disposed in the middle of the substrate <b>301</b> and protruding from the substrate <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The heat sink <b>40</b> includes a metal heat plate <b>401</b> and a metal heat pipe <b>402</b>. The heat plate <b>401</b> is substantially rectangular configuration corresponding to the electrical package <b>30</b> and defines a longitudinal side and a traversal side. The heat plate <b>401</b> comprises a first pressing portion <b>4011</b> depressed in a bottom surface thereof and protruding out off top surface thereof, and a second pressing portion <b>4012</b> symmetrically disposed in the traversal sides of the heat plate <b>401</b>. The first pressing portion <b>4011</b> has a recess at a bottom end thereof used for receiving the die <b>302</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b>. When assemble the heat plate <b>401</b> upon the electrical package <b>30</b>, the first pressing portion <b>4011</b> of the heat plate <b>401</b> presses the die <b>302</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b> and the second pressing portion <b>4012</b> presses the substrate <b>301</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b> so as the electrical package <b>30</b> can keep in a good condition.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The load plate <b>50</b> is used for pressing the electrical package <b>30</b> toward the electrical socket <b>20</b>, and made of metal material or other material, in the present embodiment, the load plate <b>50</b> is made of metal material. The load plate <b>50</b> is substantially rectangular configuration and comprises a pair of parallel retaining portions <b>501</b> in traversal sides and a pair of parallel loading portion <b>502</b> connected with the retaining portion <b>501</b> in longitudinal sides. The corners of the retaining portion <b>501</b> define a plurality of holes <b>5011</b> for a plurality of screws <b>7</b> or the like extending therethrough to fasten the load plate to the printed circuit board <b>60</b>. The retaining portion <b>501</b> and loading portion <b>502</b> form an opening <b>503</b> therebetween to allow the heat plate <b>401</b> passing through.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown assembly processes of the electrical connector assembly: first solder the electrical connector <b>20</b> to the printed circuit board <b>60</b>; then put the electrical package <b>30</b> to the cavity <b>202</b> of the electrical connector <b>20</b>; at last assemble the heat dissipate device upon the electrical package <b>30</b>. The assembly processes of the heat dissipate device is different to generally processes, which essentially comprises steps as follows: (1) solder the heat pipe <b>402</b> to the heat plate <b>401</b> to form an entity heat sink <b>40</b>; (2) put the entity heat sink <b>40</b> into the opening <b>503</b> of the load plate <b>50</b> to make the heat pipe <b>402</b> above the load plate <b>50</b> and the heat plate <b>401</b> in the opening <b>503</b> of the load plate <b>50</b>; (3) rotate the load plate <b>50</b> to make the load plate <b>50</b> pressed the second pressing portion <b>4012</b> of the heat plate <b>401</b>, in present embodiment, the load plate <b>50</b> is rotated substantially 90 degrees; (4) fasten the load plate <b>50</b> to the circuit board <b>60</b> by screws <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To achieve the assembly of the heat dissipate device processes as above said, the opening <b>503</b> of the load plate <b>50</b> and the heat plate <b>401</b> must achieve some special structures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> describes some special structures of the opening <b>503</b> of the load plate <b>50</b> and the heat plate <b>401</b>. We use &#x201c;d&#x201d; to represent the length of the opening <b>503</b>, &#x201c;c&#x201d; to represent the width of the opening <b>503</b>, and use &#x201c;b&#x201d; and &#x201c;a&#x201d; respectively to represent the length and width of the heat plate <b>401</b>. The special structures are as follows: firstly, the heat plate <b>401</b> must be rectangular configuration, i.e. b&#x3e;a. The ends of the long sides must provide the second pressing portion <b>4012</b> for supporting the load plate <b>50</b> and the first pressing portion <b>4011</b> which is higher than the second pressing portion <b>4012</b> (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shown) for distributing a force to the die <b>302</b> and the substrate <b>301</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b>; secondly, the longitudinal sides and the traversal sides of the opening <b>503</b> of the load plate <b>50</b> is bigger or equal than the respectively longitudinal sides and the traversal sides of the heat plate <b>401</b>, i.e. d&#x2267;b, c&#x2267;a, thereby the heat plate <b>401</b> can be put into the opening <b>503</b> of load plate <b>50</b>; thirdly, the length of the heat plate <b>401</b> must be bigger than the width of the opening <b>503</b>, i.e. b&#x3e;c, under this condition, after rotating the load plate <b>50</b> respective to the heat plate <b>401</b>, the loading portion <b>502</b> of the load plate <b>50</b> could press on the second pressing portion <b>4012</b> of the heat plate <b>401</b>. As has been said, we can use one expression to illustrate the special structure that is d&#x2267;b&#x3e;c&#x2267;a.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a side view of the heat plate <b>401</b> assembled to the electrical package <b>30</b>. Understandably, the die <b>302</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b> supports the first pressing portion <b>4011</b> and the substrate <b>301</b> of the electrical package <b>30</b> supports the second pressing portion <b>4012</b>, thus the die <b>302</b> and the substrate <b>301</b> could bear the force simultaneously for preventing the warp of the electrical package <b>30</b>. The loading plate <b>50</b> mounted to the print circuit board <b>60</b> has two main functions: the first is to secure the electrical package <b>30</b> on the electrical connector <b>20</b> to establish well electrical connection; the second is to secure the heat plate <b>401</b> on the electrical package <b>30</b> for dissipating heat from the electrical package <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The principle of the present invention is first soldered the heat plate <b>401</b> and the heat pipe <b>402</b> together as an entity heat sink <b>40</b> and then assembled the heat sink <b>40</b> to the load plate <b>50</b> to make the load plate <b>50</b> positioned between the heat plate <b>401</b> and heat pipe <b>402</b> and clamped by the heat sink <b>40</b>. Accordingly, when in the process of soldering the heat plate <b>401</b> and the heat pipe <b>402</b> together, the load plate <b>50</b> will not be warped. If we first assemble the heat plate <b>401</b>, load plate <b>50</b> and then weld the heat pipe <b>402</b> on the heat plate <b>401</b>, understandably, this will generate quantity of heat to make the load plate <b>50</b> warped.</p>
