<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, the present invention finds advantageous application in all those cases where it becomes necessary to provide an electrical connection between two environments, which must be kept electrically insulated and in at least one of which there may be envisaged the presence of a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the specific field of photovoltaic-cell solar panels it is known to use panels comprising an external fluid-tight casing permeable to light, housed in which is a plurality of photovoltaic cells immersed in a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Following upon exposure of the panel to solar radiation and to the normal activity of the photovoltaic cells, the photovoltaic cells themselves convert part of the incident solar energy into electrical energy that is transferred on the outside via different electrical-connection devices, which, in some cases, prove to be relatively complex and costly and, in others, decidedly simpler but with an unsatisfactory level of efficiency, reliability, and safety over time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The aim of the present invention is to provide an electrical-connection device, particularly for solar panels, which will present a high and invariant efficiency and functional reliability and a particularly contained cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided according to the present invention is an electrical-connection device, particularly for photovoltaic-cell panels, comprising a first electrical terminal, designed to be connected to means for generation or use of electrical energy and to extend in a fixed position through a wall for support of the connection device; sealing means for fluid-tight coupling of said first electrical terminal to said supporting wall; a second electrical terminal, connected to said first electrical terminal and to an electrical wiring external to said supporting wall; and an electrically insulated fluid-tight chamber, housing at least partially said first and second electrical terminals.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, designated by <b>1</b> is a fluid-tight electrical-connection device, particularly, but not exclusively, for a photovoltaic-cell solar panel <b>2</b>, to which the ensuing treatment will make explicit reference, without this implying any loss in generality.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the particular example described, the photovoltaic solar panel <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) comprises a shell or external casing <b>3</b>, which in turn comprises a rear wall or tray <b>4</b>, a front wall <b>5</b> facing the wall <b>4</b> and made of a material permeable to light, for example glass, and two terminal closing elements, not visible in the attached figures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The front wall <b>5</b> and rear wall <b>4</b>, and the terminal closing elements delimit between them a fluid-tight chamber <b>6</b>, which houses a plurality of photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> supported in fixed and pre-set positions by an attachment and supporting plate <b>9</b>, which is also housed in the fluid-tight chamber <b>6</b> and made at least in part of metal material. Within the chamber <b>6</b>, the photovoltaic cells are at least partially embedded in a cooling liquid, which is made to circulate inside the chamber <b>6</b> itself via a hydraulic circuit connected to a heat exchanger (not illustrated) external to the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> are connected to an external electrical wiring <b>10</b>, terminating with a cable lug or eyelet <b>11</b> via the device <b>1</b>, which comprises a screw <b>12</b> made of metal material that forms a terminal for electrical connection of the photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> with the outside. The screw <b>12</b> comprises a head <b>13</b> housed in the chamber <b>6</b>, set bearing upon a shoulder <b>14</b> provided on the plate <b>9</b> and on the wall <b>4</b> and blocked in an angularly fixed position with respect to the plate <b>9</b>. The screw <b>12</b> comprises, then, an externally threaded stem <b>15</b> extending through two through holes <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, which are made in the plate <b>9</b> and, respectively, in the rear wall <b>4</b>, coaxially to an axis <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the screw <b>12</b>. Fitted on the stem <b>15</b> is an annular seal <b>19</b> comprising, starting from its free end facing the head <b>13</b> of the screw <b>12</b>, a cylindrical end stretch <b>20</b> extending through the hole <b>16</b> and set bearing upon the head <b>13</b> of the screw, an intermediate cylindrical stretch <b>21</b> extending through the hole <b>17</b> and having an outer diameter larger than that of the cylindrical stretch <b>20</b>, and a terminal flange <b>22</b> set bearing upon an outer surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rear portion <b>4</b>. Screwed on the stem <b>15</b> of the screw <b>12</b> is an internally threaded blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> of a cap nut <b>25</b> made of metal material, a milled external terminal flange <b>26</b> of which tightens the flange <b>22</b> against the rear wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>to form a fluid-tight seal. Fitted on the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> is the cable lug <b>11</b>, which extends, together with a terminal stretch of the wiring <b>10</b>, within a pipe-like body <b>27</b> made of insulating material for electrical insulation from outside of the cable lug <b>11</b> and the cap nut <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pipe-like body <b>27</b>, which, together with the cap nut <b>25</b>, the seal <b>19</b>, and the cable lug <b>11</b>, forms part of the electrical-connection device <b>1</b>, comprises a barrel-shaped hollow portion <b>28</b>, which surrounds the cable lug <b>11</b>, the cap nut <b>25</b>, and the flange <b>22</b> of the seal <b>19</b>. The pipe-like body <b>27</b> moreover comprises a hollow appendage <b>30</b>, which radially and integrally extends from the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> and envelops the electrical wiring <b>10</b> and part of the cable lug <b>11</b> in a fluid-tight manner. The barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> is set bearing upon the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the wall <b>4</b> and is coupled to the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>itself in a fluid-tight manner via two concentric front sealing projections <b>32</b> made in a single piece with the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> itself. The portion <b>28</b> partially houses a mushroom-shaped body <b>33</b>, which forms part of the pipe-like body <b>27</b> and closes the portion <b>28</b> in a fluid-tight manner. The body <b>33</b> comprises a head <b>34</b> with a slot for a screw-driver set bearing upon a front surface of the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> and coupled to the front surface itself in a fluid-tight manner by a front annular sealing projection <b>35</b> made in a single piece with the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> itself. The body <b>33</b> moreover comprises a hollow stem <b>36</b>, which terminates bearing upon the cable lug <b>11</b> and delimits a blind hole <b>37</b>, housing, with radial play, the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> of the cap nut <b>25</b>. Blocked in the stem <b>36</b> in a fixed position and coaxially to the axis <b>12</b><i>a </i>is a tightening nut <b>38</b>, which is screwed on an externally threaded terminal stretch <b>39</b> of the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> for gripping the cable lug <b>11</b> between the cap nut <b>25</b> and the flange <b>26</b> and forcing in a fluid-tight way the projections <b>32</b> against the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rear wall <b>4</b> and the projection <b>35</b> against its head <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Installation of the device <b>1</b> is performed as defined in what follows. During assembly of the solar panel <b>2</b>, the screw <b>12</b> is coupled to the plate <b>9</b>, and then the seal <b>19</b> is inserted in the holes <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> and the flange <b>22</b> brought to bear upon the surface <b>4</b><i>a</i>. At this point, the cap nut <b>25</b> is screwed on the stem <b>15</b> until it forces the flange <b>22</b> against said part and insulates the chamber <b>6</b> from the outside in a fluid-tight manner, after which the cable lug <b>11</b>, previously housed in the barrel-shaped body <b>28</b> is fitted on the portion <b>24</b>, brought to bear upon the flange <b>26</b> and tightened against the flange itself via the lid <b>33</b>, the nut <b>38</b> of which is screwed on the portion <b>24</b> itself and gripped by pack-tightening together the plate <b>9</b>, the tubular portion <b>28</b>, and the cable lug <b>11</b>, to form in this way an external fluid-tight chamber <b>40</b> insulated from the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">From the foregoing, it appears evident how the characteristics of implementation of the device <b>1</b> described, on the one hand, render the chamber housing the photovoltaic cells fluid-tight preventing any leakage of liquid or entry of external agents into the chamber itself and, on the other, insulate electrically from outside the cable lug <b>11</b>, part of the corresponding electrical wiring and the stem of the screw <b>12</b> for electrical connection through the casing by enclosing them in a dedicated chamber. Since the chamber <b>40</b> is fluid-tight, it receives and withholds any possible leakage of fluid from the chamber <b>6</b>, preventing the fluid from being dispersed into the surrounding environment, thus contaminating it, once again, however, without ever jeopardizing the electrical functionality of the solar panel. It is therefore evident that the device <b>1</b> described presents an efficiency and reliability that are not only high but are practically invariant over time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">From the foregoing, it appears evident that modifications and variations may be made to the device <b>1</b> described herein, without thereby departing from the scope of protection defined by the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, the screw <b>12</b> could be different from the one indicated and, for example, of the stud-screw type with a terminal or intermediate portion screwed in a threaded through hole of the plate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Finally, from the foregoing it appears evident that the device <b>1</b> described can find applications different from the one indicated and, in particular, in all the cases in which is it becomes necessary to make a fluid-tight electrical connection through a wall separating two environments, at least one of which houses or is traversed by a liquid.</p>
