<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(Not Applicable)</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to exterior wall mount flashing for extending air conditioning lines through a wall of a building, and more particularly to an air conditioning flashing panel mount which provides a plurality of apertures adapted to receive a refrigerant and/or electrical control line of an air conditioning system through a wall of a residential and/or commercial building so as to eliminate any access into the building by unwanted intrusions such as air, water, rodents and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is commonly known, air conditioners typically use the evaporation of a refrigerant, like Freon, to provide air cooling. For example, conventional window mounted air conditioners have traditionally been utilized in small indoor spaces (e.g., one-bedroom apartment). This type of air conditioner is made small enough to fit into a standard window frame. The air conditioner is then operated for cooling in which its fan blows air over its condenser coils to deliver cold air to the indoor space.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although conventional window air conditioners are suitable for small indoor spaces, they are not, however, effective or efficient for cooling larger indoor spaces such as a residential house or a commercial building. As such, central air conditioners are typically used for larger residential houses and commercial buildings. The central air conditioner is a more efficient way to cool such larger indoor spaces by providing controlled flow of chilled air through the air ducts of a conventional forced-air heating/cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As is known, central air conditioners include a compressor typically installed outside the residential house or commercial building and a condenser typically located inside the building and resident within a conventional forced air heating and ventilation system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, the compressor of the central air conditioner is placed on a concrete pad located outside the residential house or commercial building. It is connected to the condenser disposed within forced-air heating system located inside the house or by a number of air conditioning lines/conduits which extend through a section of an exterior wall of the building. More specifically, two refrigerant lines (typically copper lines for supplying/delivering a compressed refrigerant gas) and a control line (electrical line for selectively activating the compressor and fan of the air conditioning system) extend between the outside-located compressor and the inside-located condenser of the forced-air heating system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As specifically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exterior roof jack flashing <b>10</b> is typically utilized in the prior art for extending the refrigerant lines <b>12</b> and the control line <b>14</b> through a particular exterior wall section <b>16</b> of a residential house or commercial building <b>18</b>. Essentially, the roof jack flashing <b>10</b> conventionally used by the construction and home-improvement industries features a conically shaped sheet metal body <b>20</b> which protrudes outwardly through the outer surface <b>22</b> of the wall section <b>16</b> and provides a single enlarged opening <b>24</b> leading to the inside of the house or building <b>18</b>. By providing such access through the wall section <b>16</b>, the two refrigerant lines <b>12</b> and the control line <b>14</b> may be run through the single enlarged opening <b>24</b> for extension between the air conditioner compressor and condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, due to its extensive size, the opening <b>24</b> of the roof jack flashing <b>10</b> remains substantially open, i.e., unfilled, despite the number of air conditioning lines <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> passing therethrough. This makes the inside of the house or building <b>18</b> very vulnerable to undesirable elements such as air, moisture or rodents entering from outside. As will be recognized, this poses a significant problem since the air, moisture, rodents and the like may damage the structural integrity and/or the aesthetic appearance of the house or building <b>18</b>, not to mention providing a substantial health risk to occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an attempt to alleviate this problem, it has been a common practice in the field to simply push a rag or fabric matting <b>26</b> around the lines to block the opening <b>24</b>. More particularly, the rags or fabric matting <b>26</b> are typically dipped in a sealant such as tar and pushed into the opening <b>24</b> to fill the spacing surrounding the air conditioning lines <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As an alternative method, foam adhesive tapes were also used to seal off the opening <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although such method has proved to be somewhat effective initially in sealing the opening <b>24</b>, it is significantly deficient to seal the opening over time. More specifically, due to it's fabric structure, the rag or matting <b>26</b> tends to degrade over time. This is also the same for the foam adhesive tapes which tend to degrade over time. Further, the pliability or flexibility of the rag or matting <b>26</b> allows shifting from its original sealing positions when the exterior wall vent <b>10</b> is inadvertently contacted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As such, the initial seal of the opening <b>24</b> can be eventually breached over time which may expose the inside of the house or building <b>18</b> to unwanted outside elements such as air, rodents and moisture. The breach in the opening's seal may not be discovered until the results of the exposure have already occurred. This usually leads to problems such as internal water damage or rodent infestation. Moreover, any attempt to remedy the breach may cause unintentional damage to the exterior finish (e.g., stucco, wood siding or paint) of the residential house or commercial building <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the above-described shortcomings of conventional exterior roof jack flashing, there exists a need in the art for an exterior wall mount flashing that can optimally seal off any opening or access to the inside of a house or a building while extending each of the air conditioning lines therethrough. More specifically, there exists a need for an exterior wall mount which can maintain such seal continuously over time so as to prevent any unwanted intrusions by air, water, rodents and/or the like into the house or building.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention specifically addresses and alleviates the above-referenced deficiencies associated with the use of the exterior roof jack flashing of the prior art. More particularly, the present invention comprises an improved air conditioning flashing panel mount which provides a plurality of panel apertures adapted to preferably accommodate a separate line of an air conditioning system through a wall of a residential and/or commercial building. By providing multiple panel apertures that can closely fit and seal their respective air conditioning lines extending therethrough, the flashing panel mount of the present invention eliminates the need for a single enlarged opening characterized in conventional prior art exterior wall mounts. This effectively prevents any unwanted intrusions from the outside environment such as air, water, rodents and/or the like from coming into the inside of the residential and/or commercial building.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an air conditioning flashing panel mount adapted to provide a generally water proof physical seal of the air conditioning lines extending into the residential and/or commercial building. The flashing panel mount of the first preferred embodiment first features a substantially flat and generally rigid or semi-rigid panel. This panel is sized and configured to be attached to a wall of the building adjacent to an exteriorly located air conditioning unit or compressor. A second surface of the panel is abutted directly against the frame of the exterior wall (e.g., wood or metal studs) in which conventional fasteners such as nails are driven through the first surface thereof for attachment to the wall frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the flashing panel mount of the present invention also features a hood member. This hood member extends outwardly from the first surface of the panel, and more preferably extends out from about the central portion of the panel. The hood member is preferably made from the same material which is used to fabricate the panel. A recess is formed within the hood member which is sized and configured to be accessed only through a second surface of the panel. More specifically, an opening is provided at the second panel surface for exposing the panel recess through that surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Formed through the lower surface of the hood member are a plurality of panel apertures, each preferably adapted to accommodate a respective one of the air conditioning lines therethrough. Each of the panel apertures provide a pathway in which the air conditioning lines can be extended through the flashing panel mount. The panel apertures are preferably sized to closely fit the diameter size of their respective air conditioning lines.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sealing member may additionally be provided on each aperture. Each sealing member preferably comprises an elastomeric sheet or rubber grommet which is positioned around an circumferential edge that forms the respective panel aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">There is further provided an air conditioning flashing panel mount which is constructed in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The flashing panel mount of the second preferred embodiment is designed to perform the identical function as that of the first embodied panel mount. However, its structure and the manner of use are slightly modified.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular, the flashing panel mount of the second preferred embodiment is attached to the wall of the building in a reverse orientation. More particularly, the first surface of its panel is abutted directly against the frame of the wall so that fasteners such as nails, can be driven through the second panel surface for attachment to the wall frame. By such reverse attachment, its hood member is no longer extending outwardly from the building but rather is disposed within the interior portion of the wall frame.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Unlike the first embodiment, the panel apertures are formed through the upper hood surface rather than through the lower hood surface. Further unlike the first embodiment, a flanged frame is provided around the recess opening in order to prevent any water or moisture from entering the panel recess. The flanged frame surrounds the recess opening, and is preferably placed immediately around the opening's edge.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the structure defined, the operation of the air conditioning flashing panel mount of the first embodiment is described herein to essentially illustrate the operation of the flashing panel mount of the second embodiment as well. Initially, a user (e.g., construction worker) fastens (via nails, for example) the panel mount onto the selected section of the building's exterior wall. Of course, in the case of the flashing panel mount of the second embodiment, the orientation of its attachment would be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The two refrigerant lines and the single electrical control line are brought through the wall and into the panel recess through its recess opening. Thereafter, the air conditioning lines are inserted through the respective panel apertures formed at the lower hood surface so as to be extended fully through the flashing panel mount of the first embodiment. They are then connected to the air conditioning unit or compressor located outside the building and connected therewith. In the flashing panel mount of the second embodiment, the air conditioning lines are first inserted through the panel apertures formed at the upper hood surface and then extended out of the panel recess through its recess opening. Any exposed portions of the refrigerant lines may be optionally wrapped or surrounded by an insulation padding.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once the air conditioning flashing panel mount becomes mounted and installed, a first layer of lath paper is then brought from below and positioned underneath the panel up to the bottom edging forming the recess opening. In addition, a second layer of lath paper is brought from above and placed over the panel to cover its surface with the exception of the outwardly extending hood member. Upon such application of lath papers, lath and stucco or conventional siding is used over the second layer of lath paper in order to finish the installation of the exterior wall. By incorporating such flashing panel mount into the structure of the building, any access created by the air conditioning lines can now be effectively eliminated so as to deter the problems associated therewith.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating preferred embodiments of the present invention only, and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> perspectively illustrates an air conditioning flashing panel mount <b>30</b> constructed in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. As indicated above, the present flashing panel mount <b>30</b> provides a plurality of panel apertures <b>32</b> each adapted to accommodate a separate line of an air conditioning system through a wall <b>16</b> of a residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b>. By providing multiple panel apertures <b>32</b> that can closely fit and seal their respective air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> extending therethrough, the present flashing panel mount <b>30</b> eliminates the prior art feature of a single enlarged opening that characterizes the conventional exterior wall mounts <b>10</b>. As will be soon discussed, this effectively prevents any unwanted intrusions from the outside environment such as water, rodents and/or the like from coming into the inside of the residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Before proceeding with the substantive explanations of the present invention, it is important to clarify certain terminologies used herein for the purpose of better understanding the present invention. First, the term &#x201c;residential building&#x201d; used throughout this section should not be construed narrowly, but rather broadly to mean any type of facility which is intended for residential purposes. Examples of such facilities include, but are not limited to, residential houses, apartments, condominiums, cabins, trailer homes and the like. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;commercial building&#x201d; should also be interpreted broadly to include any facility that is intended for purposes other than for residence such as hotels, motels, retail stores, office buildings, factory buildings and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the air conditioning flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first preferred embodiment includes a panel <b>38</b> adapted to be attached to the wall <b>16</b> of the building <b>18</b> which is adjacent to an exteriorly located air conditioning unit or compressor (not shown). More specifically, a second surface <b>40</b> of the panel is abutted directly against frames <b>42</b> of the wall <b>16</b> (e.g., wood studs) in which fasteners <b>44</b> such as nails, screws or staples are driven through the first surface <b>46</b> thereof for attachment to the wall frames <b>42</b>. As such, the first panel surface <b>46</b> is faced away from the building <b>18</b> when the panel <b>38</b> is attached thereto. Of course, the second panel surface <b>40</b> would face toward the building <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This panel <b>38</b> may be fabricated from any material which can provide semi-rigidity or rigidity after fabrication such as sheet metal or plastic. However, plastic is the material of choice as it can be easily molded to form a one-piece panel. Although the panel <b>38</b> may possess various configurations and sizes, it is preferably flat and rectangular in configuration, and has a size which is sufficient to create an enlarged moisture-impervious perimeter around the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first preferred embodiment also features a hood member <b>48</b> which extends outward from the first surface <b>46</b> of the panel <b>38</b>. Although such hood member <b>48</b> may be outwardly extended from any location of the first panel surface <b>46</b>, it is preferred that the hood member <b>48</b> extends out from about the central portion <b>50</b> of the panel <b>38</b> so that the water-impervious perimeter formed by the panel <b>38</b> is evenly set around the hood member <b>48</b>. Preferably, the hood member <b>48</b> is made from the same material which is used to fabricate the panel <b>38</b>. The hood member <b>48</b> of the first preferred embodiment may be formed to have various configurations and shapes. Preferably, however, it is generally rectangular in configuration so as to define substantially planar upper and lower hood surfaces <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, the significance of which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The interior of the hood member <b>48</b> is substantially hollow and void. Hence, a recess <b>56</b> is formed within the hood member <b>48</b> which can be accessed only through a second surface <b>40</b> of the panel <b>38</b>. More specifically, an opening <b>58</b> is provided at the second panel surface <b>40</b> for exposing the panel recess <b>56</b> through that surface <b>40</b>. Even though the recess opening <b>58</b> may be sized to only partially expose the panel recess <b>56</b>, it is preferred that the size of the opening <b>58</b> is substantially equivalent to that of the panel recess <b>56</b> so as to fully expose the panel recess <b>56</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Formed through the lower surface <b>54</b> of the hood member <b>48</b> are a plurality of panel apertures <b>32</b> each specifically adapted to accommodate a respective one of the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> therethrough. Each of the panel apertures <b>32</b> communicate with the panel recess <b>56</b> which is exposed through the recess opening <b>58</b>. This provides a series of pathways in which the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be extended through the flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although not by way of limitation, the number of panel apertures <b>32</b> provided is preferably identical to the number of the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> that need to extend through the wall <b>16</b> of the building <b>18</b>. In this respect, there are three panel apertures <b>32</b> to accommodate the two refrigerant lines <b>34</b> and the electrical control line <b>36</b> that are elongated between the exteriorly-located air conditioning unit or compressor and the interiorly-located forced-air heating system (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The panel apertures <b>32</b> are preferably sized to closely fit the diameter size of their respective air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. Thus, the panel apertures <b>32</b> intended for the refrigerant lines <b>34</b> would be larger in size than the panel aperture <b>32</b> intended for the electrical control line <b>36</b>. By conforming the aperture sizes to the line sizes, it significantly reduces any spacing between the panel apertures <b>32</b> and their respective air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. This lessens the amount of access into the residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a sealing member <b>60</b> may be provided to seal off each aperture <b>32</b> while allowing the respective air conditioning line <b>34</b> or <b>36</b> to pass through. Each sealing member <b>60</b> is preferably a grommet which is positioned around an aperture edging <b>62</b> that forms the respective panel aperture <b>32</b>. The sealing member <b>60</b> or grommet may be described as having an O-ring configuration. More specifically, each of the grommets has a groove <b>64</b> which captures the edge <b>62</b> of their respective panel apertures <b>32</b> so as to be fixed in position. Preferably, the grommets are each fabricated from an elastomeric material such as rubber so as to protect the structural integrity of both the aperture edgings <b>62</b> and the lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, it should be noted that the lower surface <b>54</b> of the hood member <b>48</b> may be formed of a stretchable sheet or membrane. Such sheet or membrane may be fabricated from various types of stretchable material. One type of such material is an elastomeric material such as rubber. In this regard, slits or holes may be created directly through the lower surface <b>54</b> which may simulate the panel apertures <b>32</b> upon stretching the sheet or membrane. This may be accomplished simply by cutting through the lower surface <b>54</b> with a cutting tool, or any of the like procedures. This would eliminate the need for using sealing members <b>60</b> such as grommets around the panel apertures <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there is further provided an air conditioning flashing panel mount <b>70</b> which is constructed in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The flashing panel mount <b>70</b> of the second preferred embodiment is designed to perform the identical function as that of the version reflected in the first embodiment. However, its structure and the manner of use are slightly modified in comparison to the first version.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, the flashing panel mount <b>70</b> of the second preferred embodiment is attached to the wall <b>16</b> of the residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b> in a reverse orientation. More particularly, the first surface <b>72</b> of its panel is abutted directly against the frames <b>42</b> of the wall <b>16</b> so that fasteners <b>74</b> such as nails can be driven through the second panel surface <b>76</b> for attachment to the wall frames <b>42</b>. Consequently, the first panel surface <b>72</b> becomes faced toward the building <b>18</b> while the second panel surface <b>76</b> is faced away therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By such reverse attachment, its hood member <b>78</b> is no longer extending outward from the building <b>18</b> but rather extends inwardly within the wall. Although the hood member <b>78</b> of the second preferred embodiment may be shaped similar or identical to the first embodied hood member <b>48</b>, the second hood member <b>78</b> is different in that its shaping is more of a half arcuate configuration rather than a general rectangular configuration. The hood member <b>78</b> tapers gradually outward from the first panel surface <b>72</b> from its lower portion <b>80</b> to its upper portion <b>82</b>, thereby producing a planar surface <b>84</b> at the upper hood portion <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Unlike the first embodiment, the panel apertures <b>86</b> are formed through the upper hood surface <b>84</b>, and not through the lower hood surface. However, similar to the first versioned panel apertures <b>32</b>, the panel apertures <b>86</b> of the second embodiment are also placed in fluid communication with the panel recess <b>88</b> and share the size and shape which are consistent therewith. Further, the use of sealing members <b>60</b> for sealing the panel apertures <b>86</b> also applies here. In this respect, each of the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be first extended from the inside of the building <b>18</b> through the respective panel apertures <b>86</b> so as to be led out of the panel recess <b>88</b> through its recess opening <b>90</b> for connection to the outside located air conditioning unit or compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order to prevent any water or moisture from entering into the outwardly faced panel recess <b>88</b>, a flanged frame <b>92</b> is provided around the recess opening <b>90</b>. More specifically, the flanged frame <b>92</b> is formed to be complimentary in shape to the edging <b>94</b> forming the recess opening <b>90</b>. Hence, the flanged frame <b>92</b> surrounds the recess opening <b>90</b>, and is preferably placed immediately around the opening's edging <b>94</b>. The flanged frame <b>92</b> utilized in the second embodiment is preferably fabricated from the same material which was used for the manufacture of the panel mount <b>70</b>. As such, the flanged frame <b>92</b> deters any water or moisture which runs down the outer surface <b>22</b> of the wall <b>16</b> of the building <b>18</b> from entering into the panel recess <b>88</b> through its recess opening <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the operation of the air conditioning flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first embodiment is described herein to essentially illustrate the operation of the flashing panel mount <b>70</b> of the second embodiment as well. The flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first embodiment is designed for the purpose of protecting the inside of a residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b> from any unwanted intrusions from outside such as rodents or water by sealing each of the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> extending therethrough. Initially, a user (e.g., construction worker, etc.) fastens (via nails, for example) the panel mount <b>30</b> onto the selected exterior section of the building's wall <b>16</b> in a manner that its hood member <b>48</b> is faced outside and the panel recess <b>56</b> is faced inside. Of course, in the case of the flashing panel mount <b>70</b> of the second embodiment, the manner of its attachment would be reversed, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The two refrigerant lines <b>34</b> and the single electrical control line <b>36</b> are brought into the panel recess <b>56</b> through its recess opening <b>58</b>. Thereafter, the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are inserted through the respective panel apertures <b>32</b> formed at the lower hood surface <b>54</b> so as to be extended fully through the flashing panel mount <b>30</b> of the first embodiment. They are then led to the air conditioning unit or compressor located outside the residential and/or commercial building <b>18</b> and connected therewith. As mentioned above in the description of the second embodied flashing panel mount <b>70</b>, the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are first inserted through the panel apertures <b>86</b> formed at the upper hood surface <b>84</b> and then led out of the panel recess <b>88</b> through its recess opening <b>90</b>. Any exposed portions of the refrigerant lines <b>34</b> may be optionally wrapped or surrounded by a thermal padding (now shown), preferably a foam padding.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the air conditioning flashing panel mount <b>30</b> becomes mounted and installed, a first layer of lath paper <b>96</b> is then brought from below and positioned underneath the panel <b>38</b> up to the bottom edge forming the recess opening <b>58</b>. In addition, a second layer of lath paper <b>98</b> is brought from above the panel <b>38</b> to cover its surface <b>46</b> with the exception of the outwardly extending hood member <b>48</b>. Upon such application of lath papers <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, lath and stucco or conventional siding is used over the second layer of lath paper <b>98</b> in order to finish the installation of the exterior wall <b>16</b>. By incorporating such flashing panel mount <b>30</b> into the structure of the building <b>18</b>, any access created by the air conditioning lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can now be effectively eliminated so as to deter the problems associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specifically, those of ordinary skill will recognize that the electrical control line may additionally be brought through one of the refrigerant line apertures thereby eliminating the need for a preferred separate electrical control line aperture formed in the panel mount. Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only certain embodiments of the present invention, and is not intended to serve as limitations of alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
