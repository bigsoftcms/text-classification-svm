<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for forming a conductive pattern on a substrate, and more particularly, it relates to a method for forming a conductive pattern in which a fine pattern can be obtained in a simple way.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In the case where a conductive pattern (a wiring pattern) is formed on a substrate such as a printed board, photolithography and etching are performed in general, and since these processes include a large number of complicated procedures, time and labor are necessary for forming a conductive pattern in general.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">As a technique to form a fine conductive pattern without performing such processes, a method in which a conductive pattern is drawn on a substrate by using a conductive paste including metal nano-particles and the thus obtained conductive paste layer is heated for forming a desired conductive pattern is known (for example, Patent Documents 1, 2 and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">As a general method for drawing a conductive pattern, a screen mask provided with an opening is used as a template for applying a conductive paste in a desired thickness by a screen printing method (for example, Patent Document 1 and the like). Apart from this, a method in which a conductive paste is directly sprayed by an inkjet method for drawing a desired conductive pattern has been developed (for example, Patent Document 2 and the like).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">The method for forming a conductive pattern described in each of Patent Documents 1 and 2 is simpler than the conventional complicated processes including the photolithography and the etching, and hence, a conductive pattern can be formed at a comparatively low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">However, it is difficult to form a fine pattern by the screen printing method, and there remain problems to be solved such as adhesion between a conductive paste and a substrate in the inkjet method. Thus, any of these methods has not become a principal technique to be replaced with the conventional conductive pattern formation method including the photolithography and the etching.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The present invention was devised in consideration of these circumstances, and an object of the invention is providing a conductive pattern formation method in which a fine pattern can be formed in a simple way at a low cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Means for Solving Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The conductive pattern formation method of this invention is a method for forming a conductive pattern on a substrate and includes a first step of providing a flat plate having a convex pattern on a surface thereof in facing relation to the substrate; a second step of supplying a fluid body containing conductive particles and a gas bubble generating agent into a gap between the substrate and the flat plate; and a third step of generating gas bubbles from the gas bubble generating agent contained in the fluid body by heating the fluid body, and in the third step, the fluid body is forced out of the gas bubbles generated from the gas bubble generating agent as the gas bubbles grow and self-assembles between the convex pattern formed on the flat plate and the substrate owing to interfacial force, and the conductive pattern formed on the substrate is made of an aggregate of the conductive particles contained in the fluid body having self-assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">In a preferred aspect, the fluid body is made of a resin, and the third step includes a sub-step of curing the resin after allowing the resin to self-assemble between the convex pattern and the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In a preferred aspect, the resin is a light setting resin and the resin having self-assembled between the convex pattern and the substrate is cured with light by selectively irradiating the resin with light in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">In a preferred aspect, the flat plate is a transparent substrate, and a light masking film is preferably formed in a surface area of the flat plate other than the convex pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">In a preferred aspect, the conductive pattern is made of the aggregate of the conductive particles in which the conductive particles are in contact with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">In a preferred aspect, the third step includes a sub-step of heating the fluid body at a temperature at which the conductive particles are melted after allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex pattern and the substrate, and the conductive particles are bonded to one another through metallic bond in the sub-step of heating.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">A melting point of the conductive particles is preferably higher than a boiling point of the gas bubble generating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">In a preferred aspect, the third step includes a sub-step of pressing the flat plate against the substrate after allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex pattern and the substrate, and the conductive particles are contact bonded to one another in the sub-step of pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">In a preferred aspect, the gas bubble generating agent is made of a material that boils when the fluid body is heated or a material that produces a gas through thermal decomposition.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">The gas bubble generating agent is preferably made of two or more kinds of materials having different boiling points.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">In a preferred aspect, the third step is performed while varying the gap between the substrate and the flat plate.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">In a preferred aspect, at least a surface of the convex pattern is made of a metal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">In a preferred aspect, the third step includes a sub-step of filling a sealant in the gap between the substrate and the flat plate after allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex pattern and the substrate and curing the sealant after filling.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">In a preferred aspect, the convex pattern is formed as a convex pattern having at least two kinds of portions with different heights.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">A portion with a smaller width is preferably higher than a portion with a larger width in the convex pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">In a preferred aspect, the substrate is a wiring board, and the conductive pattern corresponds to at least a part of a wiring pattern formed on the wiring board.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">In a preferred aspect, the method further includes a step of removing the flat plate after the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">The conductive pattern preferably has a cross-section in a shape of an hourglass.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">The wiring board of this invention is a wiring board on which a wiring pattern is formed, and the wiring pattern is formed by providing a flat plate having a convex pattern on a surface thereof in facing relation to the wiring board, supplying a fluid body including conductive particles and a gas bubble generating agent into a gap between the wiring board and the flat plate, and heating the fluid body for allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex pattern formed on the flat plate and the wiring board, whereby forming the wiring pattern made of an aggregate of the conductive particles included in the fluid body having self-assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">In a preferred aspect, in the wiring pattern made of the aggregate of the conductive particles, the conductive particles are bonded to one another through metallic bond by heating the fluid body having self-assembled between the convex pattern and the wiring board.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">In the conductive pattern formation method of this invention, gas bubbles are generated from a gas bubble generating agent included in a fluid body by heating the fluid body supplied into a gap between a substrate and a flat plate, and the fluid body is forced out of the gas bubbles by the growing gas bubbles, so that the fluid body can be allowed to self-assemble between a convex pattern formed on the flat plate and the substrate owing to the interfacial force. As a result, an aggregate of the conductive particles included in the fluid body having self-assembled forms a conductive pattern, and thus, the conductive pattern can be easily formed in a simple way of heating.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Furthermore, since the conductive pattern is formed in a self-assembly manner in accordance with the convex pattern, the conductive pattern can be formed in a fine shape.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">In addition, when a curable material such as a resin is used as the fluid body, the conductive pattern made of the aggregate of the conductive particles can attain a structure stable in the strength by curing the fluid body of the resin or the like after forming the conductive pattern through the self-assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">The present inventor has made various examinations on a method for forming a bump through self-assembly of conductive particles (such as a solder powder) on an electrode of a wiring board or a semiconductor chip, or on a flip-chip mounting method by forming a connecting body between electrodes of a wiring body and a semiconductor chip through self-assembly of conductive particles between the electrodes, and has proposed a novel bump formation method and a novel flip-chip mounting method (Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-094232).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</figref> and <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>D are diagrams for showing basic procedures in the bump formation method disclosed by the present inventor in the aforementioned patent application. The bump formation method alone will be herein described because the basic procedures are common to the flip-chip mounting method.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> including conductive particles (solder powder) <b>16</b> and a gas bubble generating agent (not shown) is supplied onto a substrate <b>31</b> having a plurality of electrodes <b>32</b> thereon. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a flat plate <b>40</b> is provided on the surface of the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">When the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is heated under this condition, gas bubbles <b>30</b> are generated from the gas bubble generating agent included in the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Then, the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> are forced out of the gas bubbles <b>30</b> as the gas bubbles <b>30</b> thus generated grow as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">The fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> thus forced out self-assembles in the shape of a column on an interface with the electrode <b>32</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> and on an interface with the flat plate <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Next, when the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is further heated, the conductive particles (solder powder) <b>16</b> included in the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> are melted, and hence, the conductive particles (solder powder) <b>16</b> included in the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> having self-assembled on the electrode <b>32</b> are bonded to one another through melting.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">Since the electrode <b>32</b> has high wettability against the conductive particles (solder powder) <b>16</b> bonded to one another through melting, a bump <b>19</b> made of the melted solder powder is formed on the electrode <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. Ultimately, when the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b> are removed, the substrate <b>31</b> having the bump <b>19</b> formed on the electrode <b>32</b> can be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">As a characteristic of this method, the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> supplied between the substrate <b>31</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b> is heated so as to generate the gas bubbles <b>30</b>, the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is forced out of the gas bubbles <b>30</b> as the gas bubbles <b>30</b> grow, and thus the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is allowed to self-assemble between the electrode <b>32</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">It is noted that the procedure for melting the solder powder by heating the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> again after allowing the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> to self-assemble on the electrode <b>32</b> is performed in order to ultimately form the bump <b>19</b> on the electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">The phenomenon that the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> self-assembles on the electrode <b>32</b> seems to be caused through a mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a diagram for showing the state where the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is forced out onto the electrode <b>32</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> by a growing gas bubble (not shown). The fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> thus brought into contact with the electrode <b>32</b> is applied with stress Fs(&#x221d;&#x3b3;) by the interfacial force &#x3b3; caused on the interface (the force derived from what is called wet spread of the resin) and is spread over the electrode <b>32</b> by the capillarity, and ultimately, the column-shaped fluid body (resin) having the boundary at the end of the electrode <b>32</b> is formed between the electrode <b>32</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">Although the column-shaped fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> formed on the electrode <b>32</b> through the self-assembly (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;resin column&#x201d;) is applied with stress F<sub>b </sub>derived from the growth (or the movement) of the gas bubble <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, it can keep its shape owing to the function of stress F<sub>&#x3b7;</sub>(&#x221d;&#x3b7;) derived from the viscosity &#x3b7; of the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">At this point, whether the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> having self-assembled can keep a given shape depends upon not only the interfacial force &#x3b3; but also an area S of the electrode <b>32</b>, a length L of the gap between the electrode <b>32</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b> and the viscosity &#x3b7; of the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">When the resin column is kept in a substantially cylindrical shape, the Laplace pressure &#x394;p is represented as follows with the radius of the cylindrical shape of the fluid body (resin) indicated by R and the wetting angle of the resin indicated by &#x3b8;:</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0060">On the basis of this formula, it is understood that the resin column is in the shape of an hourglass and functions as attractive force when &#x3b8;&#x3c;2/L. Also, the stress Fs is represented as follows:

<p id="p-0066" num="0064">Therefore, the stability of the resin column can be increased also by increasing the viscosity &#x3b7;.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">As described above, the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is formed on the electrode <b>32</b> in a self-aligned manner by utilizing the self-assembly of the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> caused by the interfacial force in this method. It can be said that the self-assembly caused by the interfacial force utilizes a phenomenon occurring merely on the electrode <b>32</b> on which the gap between the substrate <b>31</b> and the flat plate <b>40</b> is smaller because the electrode <b>32</b> formed on the substrate <b>31</b> is in a convex shape.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">In the bump formation method, since the electrode is originally formed on the substrate in a convex shape, the fluid body (resin) naturally self-assembles on the electrode. The present inventor has noticed that if an arbitrary convex pattern is previously formed on a flat plate, a fluid body (resin) can be formed in a self-assembly manner in accordance with the convex pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">Specifically, when a convex pattern is formed on a flat plate in the same pattern as a desired conductive pattern, the desired conductive pattern can be formed on a substrate by utilizing the self-assembly of a fluid body (resin) caused by the interfacial force.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">Now, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings mentioned below, the same reference numerals are used to refer to elements having substantially the same functions for simplifying the description. It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described below.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4E</figref> are diagrams for showing basic procedures in a conductive pattern formation method according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a fluid body <b>14</b> including conductive particles <b>16</b> and a gas bubble generating agent (not shown) is supplied onto a substrate <b>11</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a flat plate <b>12</b> having a plurality of convex patterns <b>13</b> is provided on the surface of the fluid body <b>14</b> so as to oppose the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0071">At this point, the convex patterns <b>13</b> are formed on the flat plate <b>12</b> in the same layout as a conductive pattern to be formed on the substrate <b>11</b>. Also, in the case where the substrate <b>11</b> is, for example, a wiring board on which electronic components and the like are built, the flat plate <b>12</b> is provided above the substrate <b>11</b> with necessary alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0072">It is noted that these procedures may be performed by previously providing the substrate <b>11</b> and the flat plate <b>12</b> so as to oppose each other with a given gap and then supplying the fluid body <b>14</b> including the conductive particles <b>16</b> and the gas bubble generating agent into the gap therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0073">When the fluid body <b>14</b> is heated under this condition, gas bubbles <b>20</b> are generated from the gas bubble generating agent included in the fluid body <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. At this point, the fluid body <b>14</b> is forced out of the gas bubbles <b>20</b> as the gas bubbles <b>20</b> grow.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0074">The fluid body <b>14</b> thus forced out self-assembles between the convex patterns <b>13</b> formed on the flat plate <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> owing to the interfacial force as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. When the flat plate <b>12</b> is removed, patterns of the fluid body <b>14</b> obtained through the self-assembly is formed on the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">At this point, an aggregate of the conductive particles <b>16</b> included in the fluid body <b>14</b> having self-assembled forms the conductive patterns with the conductive particles <b>16</b> in contact with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the conductive patterns <b>18</b> formed on the substrate <b>11</b> through the procedures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4E</figref>. Although the conductive patterns <b>18</b> are in a linear shape with a constant width in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the width may be varied in the middle. Alternatively, not only a linear pattern but also a bent pattern or a crossing pattern can be formed. In this case, in order to easily keep the shape of the fluid body <b>14</b> having self-assembled, each corner of the conductive patterns may be designed to have inclination of 45 degrees or a curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077">In the case where the substrate <b>11</b> is a wiring board, the conductive patterns <b>18</b> correspond to wiring patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0078">According to this invention, gas bubbles are generated from the gas bubble generating agent included in the fluid body <b>14</b> by heating the fluid body <b>14</b> supplied into the gap between the substrate <b>11</b> and the flat plate <b>12</b>, and the fluid body <b>14</b> is forced out of the gas bubbles by the growing gas bubbles, so that the fluid body <b>14</b> can be allowed to self-assemble between the convex patterns <b>13</b> formed on the flat plate <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> owing to the interfacial force. As a result, the aggregate of the conductive particles <b>16</b> included in the fluid body <b>14</b> having self-assembled forms the conductive patterns <b>18</b>, and thus, the conductive patterns <b>18</b> can be easily formed in a simple way of heating.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0079">Furthermore, since the conductive patterns <b>18</b> are formed in accordance with the convex patterns <b>13</b> in a self-assembly manner, the conductive patterns <b>18</b> can be formed in fine shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0080">Moreover, since each conductive pattern formed in this invention has a cross-section typically in the shape of an hourglass (having a neck in the middle), the adhesiveness to the substrate can be improved as compared with a wiring pattern (typically having a rectangular or trapezoidal cross-section) formed by the conventional method including the etching and the like. Also, since its face opposite to the face on the side of the substrate is formed in substantially the same size as the face on the side of the substrate, also when the conductive pattern is to be connected to, for example, a gold bump formed on a semiconductor chip, the connection area can be large, so as to realize highly reliable semiconductor mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0081">It is noted that the sizes of the respective elements and the relative positional relationship among them (for example, the size of the conductive particles <b>16</b> and the length of the gap between the substrate <b>11</b> and the flat plate <b>12</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4E</figref> and <b>5</b> are given merely for the sake of convenience and do not correspond to the actual sizes and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0082">Next, a conductive pattern formation method in using a light setting resin as the fluid body <b>14</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a flat plate <b>12</b> having convex patterns <b>13</b> thereon is provided so as to oppose a substrate <b>11</b>, and a fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> including conductive particles <b>16</b> and a gas bubble generating agent (not shown) is supplied into a gap between the substrate <b>11</b> and the flat plate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0084">When the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> is heated under this condition, gas bubbles <b>20</b> are generated from the gas bubble generating agent included in the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. At this point, the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> is forced out of the gas bubbles <b>20</b> as the generated gas bubbles <b>20</b> grow.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">The fluid body (resin) <b>14</b> thus forced out self-assembles between the convex patterns <b>13</b> formed on the flat plate <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> owing to the interfacial force as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0086">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> is irradiated with light <b>22</b> of UV or the like through the substrate <b>11</b>. At this point, when the substrate <b>11</b> is made of a transparent member (such as glass) and has a light masking film <b>23</b> (of, for example, a chromium film) formed on its surface area other than the convex patterns <b>13</b>, the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> having self-assembled can be selectively irradiated with the light, and as a result, the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> thus irradiated with the light can be selectively cured.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0087">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, the flat plate <b>12</b> is removed, so as to form patterns of the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> obtained through the self-assembly, namely, conductive patterns <b>18</b> made of an aggregate of the conductive particles <b>16</b>, on the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0088">In this manner, when the fluid body (light setting resin) <b>14</b> is cured after forming the conductive patterns <b>18</b> through the self-assembly, the conductive patterns <b>18</b> made of the aggregate of the conductive particles <b>16</b> can be formed in a structure stable in the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0089">Although the light setting resin is herein used, a thermosetting resin may be used instead. In the case where a thermosetting resin is used, the contact among the conductive particles <b>16</b> can be made stronger through shrinkage of the resin caused during the thermal curing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0090">Furthermore, when the fluid body (resin) is heated to a temperature at which the conductive particles <b>16</b> are melted after the self-assembly of the fluid body (resin) <b>14</b>, the conductive particles <b>16</b> are bonded to one another through metallic bond, and thus, the conductive patterns can be formed in a structure stable in the strength as well as the resistance value of the conducive patterns can be made smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">It is noted that when a thermosetting resin is used as the fluid body <b>14</b>, the conductive particles <b>16</b> are melted at the same time as the resin is cured through the aforementioned heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</figref> are cross-sectional views for showing exemplified process for allowing the fluid body <b>14</b> to self-assemble between the convex patterns <b>13</b> and the substrate <b>11</b>, filling a sealant (of, for example, a resin) in the gap between the substrate and the flat plate <b>12</b> and curing the sealant.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a diagram for showing a state attained after the procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> in the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4E</figref>, namely, a state where the fluid body <b>14</b> has self-assembled between the convex patterns <b>13</b> and the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0094">Under this condition, a sealant <b>21</b> (of, for example, a resin) is filled in the gap between the substrate <b>11</b> and the flat plate <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, and the sealant <b>21</b> is cured. Thereafter, the flat plate <b>12</b> is removed, and projecting portions of the sealant <b>21</b> are cut off so as to set the surface of the sealant <b>21</b> at the same level as that of the conductive patterns <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the conductive patterns <b>18</b> (the fluid body <b>14</b>) formed on the substrate <b>11</b> through the self-assembly are sealed with the sealant <b>21</b>, and thus, the structure of the conductive patterns <b>18</b> can be made rigid and the conductive patterns <b>18</b> can be protected by the sealant <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0096">According to the conductive pattern formation method of this invention, a conductive pattern can be formed in an arbitrary shape, and furthermore, conductive patterns having different heights (thicknesses) can be simultaneously formed. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a diagram for showing a procedure for supplying a fluid body <b>14</b> including conductive particles <b>16</b> and a gas bubble generating agent (not shown) into a gap between a substrate <b>11</b> and a flat plate <b>12</b> and heating the fluid body <b>14</b>, and this procedure is different from the procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> in convex patterns <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>with different heights formed on the flat plate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, gas bubbles <b>20</b> are generated from the gas bubble generating agent included in the fluid body <b>14</b>, the fluid body <b>14</b> is forced out of the gas bubbles <b>20</b> as the gas bubbles <b>20</b> grow and the fluid body <b>14</b> thus forced out self-assembles between the convex patterns <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the substrate <b>11</b> owing to the interfacial force as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0099">As a result, when the flat plate <b>12</b> is removed, conductive patterns <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>(fluid bodies <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>) with different heights are formed on the substrate <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0100">This is for the following reason: Portions of the fluid body <b>14</b> respectively in contact with the surfaces of the convex patterns <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>are wholly spread over the convex patterns <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>owing to the interfacial force obtained on the interfaces, and thereafter, the portions of the fluid body <b>14</b> can keep their shapes due to the function of the stress caused by the viscosity of the fluid body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0101">On the basis of Formula 1 described above, in order to improve the stability of the column-shaped fluid body (resin column) <b>14</b> formed through the self-assembly, among the convex patterns <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>having the different heights, a pattern with a smaller width (namely, the convex pattern <b>13</b><i>a</i>) preferably has a larger height than a pattern with a larger width (namely, the convex pattern <b>13</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0102">Since the conductive patterns with the different heights and widths can be thus simultaneously formed, in the case where the conductive patterns are used as, for example, signal lines, impedance can be easily matched.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0103">Moreover, when a release agent such as an acrylic resin is previously applied on a substrate and a conductive pattern is formed on the substrate by the method of this invention so as to transfer the conductive pattern onto another member, the present method is applicable to formation of a microwave circuit conventionally difficult to form. At this point, an adhesive material is preferably applied previously to the member onto which the pattern is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0104">Furthermore, when conductive patterns partially having different heights are formed on a substrate by the method of this invention and another substrate having a wiring pattern thereon is stacked on the substrate to be pressed at a given pressure, wirings are connected to each other between these substrates through a wiring partially having a larger height. At this point, when the surface of the substrate on which the conductive patterns are formed is placed in a semi-cured state, a multilayered wiring board can be obtained by curing this substrate after connecting the wirings between the substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0105">Herein, the fluid body <b>14</b>, the conductive particles <b>16</b> and the gas bubble generating agent used in the conductive pattern formation method of this invention are not particularly specified, and following materials can be respectively used:</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0106">The fluid body <b>14</b> may be any fluid body having given viscosity to the extent that it is fluid in a temperature range from room temperature to the melting temperature of the conductive particles <b>16</b>, and may be a fluid body having viscosity lowered to be fluid by heating. Typical examples are a thermosetting resin such as an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a silicone resin, a diallyl phthalate resin, a furan resin or a melamine resin, a thermoplastic resin such as polyester estramer, a fluororesin, a polyimide resin, a polyamide resin or an aramid resin, a light (UV) setting resin or the like, and a combination of any of them. Apart from these resins, a high-boiling solvent, an oil or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0107">Furthermore, materials shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> can be appropriately combined to be used as the conductive particles <b>16</b> and the gas bubble generating agent. When the melting point of a material of the conductive particles <b>16</b> is higher than the boiling point of a material of the gas bubble generating agent, it is possible to perform, after allowing the fluid body to self-assemble by generating gas bubbles from the gas bubble generating agent by heating the fluid body <b>14</b>, a procedure for further heating the fluid body <b>14</b> for melting the conductive particles included in the fluid body having self-assembled so as to bond the conductive particles to one another through the metallic bond.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0108">Moreover, the gas bubble generating agent may be made of two or more kinds of materials having different boiling points. When the boiling points are different, there arises a difference in timing of the generation and the growth of the gas bubbles, and as a result, the fluid body <b>14</b> is forced out through the growth of the gas bubbles in a stepwise manner. Therefore, the process of the self-assembly of the fluid body <b>14</b> can be made homogeneous, so that conductive patterns with more homogeneity can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0109">Apart from the materials shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a material for generating gas bubbles through thermal decomposition of the gas bubble generating agent in heating the fluid body <b>14</b> can be used as the gas bubble generating agent. As such a gas bubble generating agent, any of materials shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can be used. For example, in the case where a compound including water of crystallization (aluminum hydroxide) is used, it is thermally decomposed when the fluid body <b>14</b> is heated, so as to generate steam in the form of gas bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0110">Although the present invention has been described in preferred embodiments, it goes without saying that the description is not restrictive but the disclosed invention may be modified in numerous ways. For example, after allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex patterns and the substrate, the flat plate may be pressed against the substrate for contact bonding the conductive particles.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0111">Alternatively, the procedure for allowing the fluid body to self-assemble between the convex patterns and the substrate may be performed while changing the gap between the substrate and the flat plate. Thus, the fluid body can be made to efficiently self-assemble between the convex patterns and the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0112">Moreover, at least surface portions of the convex patterns may be made of a metal. Thus, the fluid body can be made more easily self-assemble because the interfacial force is varied on the metal surface. Furthermore, in the case where the conductive patterns are formed through the metallic bond of the conductive particles by melting the conductive particles, the melted conductive particles can be easily bonded to the metal face with high wettability, so as to further reduce the resistance value.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0113">According to the present invention, a conductive pattern formation method in which a fine pattern can be formed in a simple way at low cost is provided.</p>
