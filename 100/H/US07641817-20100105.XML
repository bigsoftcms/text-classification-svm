<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a silver powder and a method for producing the same. More specifically, the invention relates to a silver powder for a conductive paste for use in electronic parts, such as internal electrodes of multilayer capacitors, conductive patterns of circuit boards, and electrodes and circuits of substrates for plasma display panels, and a method for producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a conventional conductive paste for use in electronic parts, such as internal electrodes of multilayer capacitors, conductive patterns of circuit boards, and electrodes and circuits of substrates for plasma display panels (PDP), there is used a silver paste produced by mixing a silver powder and a glass frit in an organic vehicle and kneading them. As the size of such electronic parts decreases, it is required that a silver powder for a conductive paste has reasonably small particle diameters and a reasonably narrow range of particle diameters in order to form a conductive pattern or the like having a high density and fine lines.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a method for producing such a silver powder for a conductive paste, there is known a method for adding an alkali or a complexing agent to an aqueous silver salt containing solution to form a silver oxide containing slurry or an aqueous silver complex salt containing solution, and thereafter, adding a reducing agent to the silver oxide containing slurry or the aqueous silver complex salt containing solution to deposit a silver powder by reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the particles of the silver powder produced by such a conventional method violently cohere, so that there is a problem in that the silver powder can not be applied to recent electronic parts having fine lines, such as internal electrodes of multilayer capacitors, conductive patterns of circuit boards, and electrodes and circuits of substrates for plasma display panels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in order to form a silver powder which includes a smaller number of particles easy to cohere and which has excellent dispersibility, there has been proposed a method comprising the steps of: adding an alkali or a complexing agent to an aqueous silver salt containing solution to form a silver oxide containing slurry or an aqueous silver complex salt containing solution; adding a reducing agent thereto to deposit silver particles by reduction; and thereafter, adding at least one of fatty acids, fatty acid salts, surface active agents, organic metals and protective colloids, serving as a dispersing agent to the silver containing slurry solution to form a silver powder (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-88206).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, if the silver powder formed by adding a fatty acid, a surface active agent or the like as a dispersing agent as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-88206 is used for preparing a paste, there are some cases where the paste causes phase separation to form suspended matters. The suspended matters form pinholes in the film of the paste to decrease the density of the film after burning.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If a paste prepared by using the silver powder formed by adding a fatty acid, a surface active agent or the like as a dispersing agent as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-88206 is printed on a substrate, there are some cases where the paste is not easily released from a screen plate, so that bubbles are drawn into the paste. As a result, there are some cases where the thickness of the burned film is not uniform, so that the value of resistance of the film varies. Therefore, such a paste is unsuitable for a conductive pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, in a conductive paste for use in an electrode of a substrate for a plasma display panel, which is required to have a high density and fine lines, the decrease of the density of the film causes severe problems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, as a conductive paste used for forming an electrode of a substrate for a plasma display panel, an alkali developable photosensitive paste is ordinarily used. The alkali developable photosensitive paste generally comprises an alkali soluble polymer, a polymerizable monomer, a photopolymerization initiator, a solvent, a glass frit and a stabilizer. However, the alkali soluble polymer contains a carboxyl group to have a high polarity, so that there are problems in that bubbles are easily drawn into the paste during the screen printing, and the thickness of the burned film is not uniform.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is therefore an object of the present invention to eliminate the aforementioned problems and to provide a silver powder having excellent dispersibility and capable of forming a paste which do not form suspended matters by phase separation and which is printed on a substrate to form a film having a uniform thickness, and a method for producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to accomplish the aforementioned and other objects, the inventors have diligently studied and found that it is possible to produce a silver powder having excellent dispersibility and capable of forming a paste which do not form suspended matters by phase separation and which is printed on a substrate to form a film having a uniform thickness, if at least one chelating agent selected from compounds having an azole structure, dicarboxylic acids, hydroxy carboxylic acids and salts thereof is added to a silver powder containing slurry solution as a dispersing agent before or after silver particles are deposited by reduction by adding a reducing agent to a silver oxide containing slurry or aqueous silver complex salt containing solution, which is formed by adding an alkali or a complexing agent to an aqueous silver salt containing solution, while stirring it. Thus, the inventors have made the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a silver powder, the method comprising the steps of: adding a reducing agent to a water reaction system containing at least one of a silver salt and silver oxide, to deposit silver particles; and adding a chelating agent to the water reaction system as a dispersing agent. In this method for producing a silver powder, the chelating agent may be added after the reducing agent is added to deposit the silver particles, or the chelating agent may be added before the reducing agent is added to deposit the silver particles. The chelating agent is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of compounds having an azole structure, dicarboxylic acids, hydroxy carboxylic acids and salts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a silver powder having a tap density of 2 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more, a mean particle diameter of 0.1 to 5 &#x3bc;m which is measured by a laser diffraction method, a specific surface area of 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g or less, and an angle of repose of 50&#xb0; or less, preferably 45&#xb0; or less, and more preferably 40&#xb0; or less. If the tap density is less than 2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, silver particles violently cohere, so that it is difficult to form fine lines. If the mean particle diameter measured by the laser diffraction method is less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m, the activity of silver particles increases so that the silver powder is not suited to be burned at a temperature of 500&#xb0; C. or higher, although it is possible to form fine lines. On the other hand, if the mean particle diameter measured by the laser diffraction method exceeds 5 &#x3bc;m, dispersibility deteriorates, so that it is also difficult to form fine lines. If the specific surface area exceeds 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g, the viscosity of a paste using the silver powder is too high, so that printing characteristics deteriorate. Moreover, as the angle of repose decreases, the flowability of the silver powder increases, so that the silver powder can be more easily handled. Such a silver powder can be produced by the above described method for producing a silver powder.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a silver powder wherein a film formed by printing a paste, which is prepared by using the silver powder, on a substrate has a surface roughness of 3 &#x3bc;m or less, and wherein silver particles in the paste has a maximum particle diameter of 30 &#x3bc;m or less, preferably 15 &#x3bc;m or less, and more preferably 7.5 &#x3bc;m or less, when it is measured by a grind gauge. Such a silver powder can be produced by the above described method for producing a silver powder.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present invention, it is possible to produce a silver powder having excellent dispersibility and capable of forming a paste which do not form suspended matters by phase separation and which is printed on a substrate to form a film having a uniform thickness.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment of a method for producing a silver powder according to the present invention, an alkali or a complexing agent, preferably aqueous ammonia, is added to an aqueous silver salt containing solution to form a silver oxide containing slurry or an aqueous silver complex salt containing solution, preferably an aqueous silver ammine complex solution, and an alkali is added thereto for controlling the pH of the slurry or solution in order to control the particle diameter of a silver powder to be produced. Then, after silver particles are deposited by reduction by adding a reducing agent to the silver oxide containing slurry or aqueous silver complex salt containing solution while stirring it, a chelating agent is added to the silver containing slurry as a dispersing agent. Alternatively, after the dispersing agent is added to the silver oxide containing slurry or aqueous silver complex salt containing solution while stirring it, silver particles may be deposited by reduction by adding the reducing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The chelating agent used as the dispersing agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of compounds having an azole structure, dicarboxylic acids, hydroxy carboxylic acids and salts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As examples of compounds having an azole structure used as the dispersing agent, there are imidazole, oxazole, thiazole, selenazole, pyrazole, isoxazole, isothiazole, 1H-1,2,3-triazole, 2H-1,2,3-triazole, 1H-1,2,4-triazole, 4H-1,2,4-triazole, 1,2,3-oxadiazole, 1,2,4-oxadiazole, 1,2,5-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,2,3-thiadiazole, 1,2,4-thiadiazole, 1,2,5-thiadiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazole, 1,2,3,4-oxatriazole, 1,2,3,4-thiatriazole, 2H-1,2,3,4-tetrazole, 1,2,3,5-oxatriazole, 1,2,3,5-thiatriazole, indazole, benzoimidazole, benzotriazole and salts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As examples of dicarboxylic acids used as the dispersing agent, there are oxalic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, didodecanoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The silver containing slurry thus obtained is filtered, washed with water, dried and pulverized into fine silver particles to obtain a silver powder. In place of the pulverizing into fine silver particles, there may be carried out a surface smoothing process for smoothing irregularities and angular portions on the surface of the silver particles by mechanically causing the silver particles to collide with each other by means of an apparatus capable of mechanically fluidizing particles as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-80901.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The silver powder thus obtained has a tap density of 2 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more, a mean particle diameter of 0.1 to 5 &#x3bc;m which is measured by the laser diffraction method, a specific surface area of 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g or less, an angle or repose of 45&#xb0; or less, and excellent dispersibility.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the silver powder thus obtained is mixed with a vehicle to form a paste, suspended matters are not formed therein by phase separation. If the paste is printed on a substrate to be dried, the film thus formed has a surface roughness of 3 &#x3bc;m or less, and the thickness of the film can be uniform. If the grain size of silver particles contained in the paste is evaluated by a grind gauge, the maximum particle diameter D<sub>max </sub>is 10 &#x3bc;m or less, and the silver particles have excellent dispersibility.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of a silver powder and a method for producing the same according to the present invention will be described below in detail.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To 3600 ml of an aqueous solution containing 12 g/l silver nitrate as silver ions, 180 ml of 25% aqueous ammonia and 15 ml of an aqueous solution containing 20 g/l sodium hydroxide were added to obtain an aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution. The temperature of the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution was maintained at 40&#xb0; C., and 192 ml of formalin (an aqueous solution containing 37% formaldehyde) was added to the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution to deposit silver particles. Thirty seconds after formalin was completely added thereto, 1% of benzotriazole with respect to the weight of silver was added to the slurry. The silver containing slurry thus obtained was filtered, washed with water, dried and pulverized into fine silver particles to obtain a silver powder. The tap density of the obtained silver powder was 4.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the mean particle diameter of the silver powder measured by the laser diffraction method was 2.8 &#x3bc;m. The specific surface area of the silver powder was 0.34 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the angle of repose of the silver powder measured in accordance with JIS R9301-2-2 was 40&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To 35 parts by weight of a vehicle consisting of 30 parts by weight of acrylic resin (BR605 produced by Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd.) and 70 parts by weight of ethyl carbitol acetate, 65 parts by weight of the obtained silver powder was added and sufficiently kneaded to be dispersed by a three-roll mill to obtain a paste. In this paste, suspended matters caused by phase separation were not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The paste thus obtained was printed on a substrate by using a screen mask of 325 meshes, and dried at 150&#xb0; C. for ten minutes to form a film on the substrate. Thereafter, the surface roughness of the film of the paste was measured by a super depth shape measuring microscope (VK-8510 produced by KEYENCE). As a result, the surface roughness was 2.1 &#x3bc;m, and the thickness of the film of the paste was uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The grain size of silver particles contained in the obtained paste was evaluated by a grind gauge. As a result, the maximum particle diameter D<sub>max </sub>was 6 &#x3bc;m, and the fourth scratch (the fourth particle diameter from the maximum particle diameter when the grain size of silver particles in the paste was measured by the grind gauge) was 6 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the mean particle diameter D<sub>50 </sub>was 3 &#x3bc;m, and excellent dispersibility was obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>

While the temperature of the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution was maintained at 40&#xb0; C., 0.4 g of an aqueous solution containing 40% benzotriazole sodium was added to the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution, and then, 192 ml of formalin (an aqueous solution containing 37% formaldehyde) was added thereto to deposit silver particles. The silver containing slurry thus obtained was filtered, washed with water, dried and pulverized into fine silver particles to obtain a silver powder. The tap density of the obtained silver powder was 4.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the mean particle diameter of the silver powder measured by the laser diffraction method was 3.3 &#x3bc;m. The specific surface area of the silver powder was 0.31 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the angle of repose of the silver powder measured in accordance with JIS R9301-2-2 was 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a paste prepared by the same method as that in Example 1 using the silver powder obtained in Example 2, suspended matters caused by phase separation were not formed. The surface roughness of the film of the paste measured by the same method as that in Example 1 was 2.7 &#x3bc;m, and the thickness of the film of the paste was uniform. Moreover, the grain size of silver particles contained in the paste was evaluated by a grind gauge similar to Example 1. As a result, the maximum particle diameter D<sub>max </sub>was 5 &#x3bc;m, and the fourth scratch was 5 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the mean particle diameter D<sub>50 </sub>was 3 &#x3bc;m, and excellent dispersibility was obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To 3600 ml of an aqueous solution containing 12 g/l silver nitrate as silver ions, 180 ml of 25% aqueous ammonia and 15 ml of an aqueous solution containing 20 g/l sodium hydroxide were added to obtain an aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution. The temperature of the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution was maintained at 40&#xb0; C., and 192 ml of formalin (an aqueous solution containing 37% formaldehyde) was added to the aqueous silver ammine complex salt solution to deposit silver particles. After formalin was completely added thereto, 0.1% of succinic acid with respect to the weight of silver was added to the slurry. The silver containing slurry thus obtained was filtered, washed with water, dried and pulverized into fine silver particles to obtain a silver powder. The tap density of the obtained silver powder was 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the mean particle diameter of the silver powder measured by the laser diffraction method was 4.5 &#x3bc;m. The specific surface area of the silver powder was 0.36 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the angle of repose of the silver powder measured in accordance with JIS R9301-2-2 was 40&#xb0;.</p>

After formalin was completely added thereto, 1% of benzotriazole with respect to the weight of silver was added to the slurry. The silver containing slurry thus obtained was filtered, washed with water, and dried to obtain silver particles.
