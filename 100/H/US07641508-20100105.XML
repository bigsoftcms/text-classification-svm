<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to the art of battery connector, and especially, to a button cell battery connector which includes reinforcing members for strengthening the retention of the battery in the battery connector.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A button cell battery is usually used in an electrical apparatus, for example a computer, provided as an auxiliary power source. This battery comprises a cathode on a lower face and an anode on an upper face and a peripheral face.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A battery connector is usually provided on a mother board to mount the battery therein to establish an electrical connection between the battery and the mother board. An example of battery connector can be seen in U.S. patent application publication No. 2007/0281540 A1 published on Dec. 6, 2007.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The battery connector comprises a dielectric housing defining a receiving cavity for retaining the battery therein, anode and cathode contacts respectively secured on the dielectric housing and electrically connected with the mother board. The anode contact is disposed on a side wall of the receiving cavity and can elastically move along a lateral direction while the cathode contact is disposed on a bottom of the receiving cavity and can elastically move along the vertical direction. The button cell battery is usually small, and in order to meet a low profile feature of the electrical apparatus using battery, the battery connector can't be made too high. The space in the connector is narrow, which makes the spring section of the contact often short and can't give enough force to hold a mounted battery in certain position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hence, an improved battery connector is required to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a battery connector for mounting a button cell battery.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a battery connector comprises a dielectric housing and a first conductive contact. The dielectric housing comprises a receiving cavity suitable for accommodating a cylindrical battery therein, a base suitable for facing a bottom face of the accommodated battery, holding means formed toward an upper section of the receiving cavity for engaging with a top face of the accommodated battery to prevent the battery from coming off, and a pair of spring strengtheners extending upwardly from said base for abutting a bottom face of the accommodated battery. The first conductive contact comprises a retaining section secured in said dielectric housing at a peripheral area of said bottom plate, and a spring arm inclining upwardly from said retaining section, wherein said spring arm extends between said pair of spring strengtheners, and a distal end of said spring arm is free.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When a battery mounted, the free end of the spring arm and the free ends of the pair of spring strengtheners engage the bottom face of the battery, the spring arm and the pair of spring strengtheners are all elastically deformed, they corporately exert strength against the bottom of the battery, the battery is stably held in place.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present embodiment when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a battery connector <b>1</b> comprises a dielectric housing <b>2</b>, a first conductive contact <b>4</b> and a second conductive contact <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The dielectric housing <b>2</b> comprises a cylindrical receiving cavity (not labeled) suitable for accommodating a battery <b>5</b> therein, a base <b>20</b> suitable for facing a bottom face of the accommodated battery <b>5</b>, holding means <b>24</b> formed toward an upper section of the receiving cavity (not labeled) for engaging with the top face of the accommodated battery <b>5</b> to prevent the battery <b>5</b> from coming off, and a pair of spring strengtheners <b>22</b> extending upwardly from said base <b>20</b> for abutting the bottom face of the accommodated battery <b>5</b>. According to the embodiment, the holding means <b>24</b> are a pair of protruding bars <b>24</b> on a side wall. The dielectric housing <b>2</b> further defines a cutout <b>26</b> between said pair of protruding bars <b>24</b> allowing a tool to eject an accommodating battery <b>5</b> out.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first conductive contact <b>4</b> comprising a first retaining section <b>40</b> secured in said dielectric housing <b>2</b> at a peripheral area of said base <b>20</b>, a spring arm <b>42</b> inclining upwardly from said retaining section <b>40</b>, and a soldering section <b>44</b> extending downwardly for an edge of the retaining section <b>40</b> opposite to the spring arm <b>42</b>. Wherein the spring arm <b>42</b>, from a top view thereof, extends between the pair of spring strengtheners <b>22</b> in a direction opposite to said pair of spring strengtheners <b>22</b>, and the distal end of said spring arm <b>42</b> is free.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second conductive contact <b>3</b> secured on a side wall (not labeled) of said receiving cavity (not labeled) opposite to the pair of protruding bars <b>24</b>. The second conductive contact <b>3</b> comprises a second retaining section <b>30</b> secured in the dielectric housing <b>2</b>, a holding section <b>36</b> for engaging with the top face of a accommodated battery <b>5</b>, an elastic connecting section <b>34</b> extending between said second retaining section <b>30</b> and said holding section <b>36</b>, and a second soldering section <b>32</b> extending downwardly from the second retaining section <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The dielectric housing <b>2</b> further defines three supporting protrusions <b>28</b> on the peripheral area of said base <b>20</b>, wherein a pair of protrusions <b>28</b> respectively stand on areas adjacent said pair of spring strengtheners, and a protrusion <b>28</b> stands on a area adjacent the second conductive contact <b>3</b>. The three supporting protrusions <b>28</b> can support the peripheral edge of a mounted battery <b>5</b> to protect the spring arm <b>42</b> from permanent deformation and to prevent a battery <b>5</b> from being mounted inversely. The base <b>20</b> defines a recess <b>27</b> right below the spring arm <b>42</b> of the first conductive contact <b>4</b>, the recess <b>27</b> has a shape such that the further the recess leaves away from the retaining section <b>40</b> the deeper it will be, it can contain the spring arm <b>42</b> therein and protects the spring arm <b>42</b> from permanent deformation when the spring arm <b>42</b> is deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a battery <b>5</b> mounted, the free end of the spring arm <b>46</b> engages the bottom face of the battery <b>5</b>, the spring arm <b>42</b> is elastically deformed, then the free ends of the pair of spring strengtheners <b>22</b> engage the bottom face of the battery, the spring arm <b>42</b> and the pair of spring strengtheners <b>22</b> are all elastically deformed, they corporately exert strength against the bottom of the battery <b>5</b>, the battery <b>5</b> is stably held in place.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention has been shown and described, equivalent modifications and changes known to persons skilled in the art according to the spirit of the present invention are considered within the scope of the present invention as described in the appended claims.</p>
