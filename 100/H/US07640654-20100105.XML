<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of and a device for transporting an electronic component, and a method of and a device for mounting the electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As tendency of downsizing, thin-model and a higher performance in an electronic device have been advanced in recent years, an electronic component mounted on a print substrate has also been downsized more and more rapidly. A size of chip components (for example, chip resistor, chip capacitor, chip inductor and the like), which is currently length 0.4 mm&#xd7;width 0.2 mm&#xd7;height 0.2 mm, is expected to be length 0.1 mm&#xd7;width 0.05 mm&#xd7;height 0.05 mm in the future. Further, a size of a semiconductor bare chip that is mainstream, is currently 0.3 mm in square, but it is expected to be reduced to 0.1 mm in square in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a process for mounting the electronic components having the aforementioned small sizes, as recited in No. 2000-77438 of the Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open, the electronic component is often mounted on a circuit substrate after it is transported under a state where it is held with a holding tool or adsorbed by a head having a vacuum suction mechanism. However, it is said that it is already almost beyond the technical limits to pick up, transport and mount even an electronic component with the current chip size (chip-type electronic component of 0.4 mm&#xd7;0.2 mm&#xd7;0.2 mm, or semiconductor bare chip having the size of 0.03 mm in square). Therefore, it is thought that it may not be possible to pick up, transport and mount a microminiature electronic component even if it is commercialized as a result of further advancements in the downsizing process. In other words, apart from the pursuit of technical innovations for the manufacturing of the microminiature electronic component, there lies another problem we have to face in the future, that is, how the downsized electronic component can be picked up, transported and mounted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the present invention was implemented in order to solve the problem, and a main object of the present invention is to provide a method capable of transporting and mounting a minute electronic component and a device thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the foregoing object, an electronic component transporting method according to the present invention comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a first step for preparing a pickup device having a pickup surface to which an electronic component retaining liquid is to be applied and capable of adjusting a wet area of the electronic component retaining liquid on the pickup surface and then applying the electronic component retaining liquid to the pickup surface; and</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a second step for retaining the electronic component on the pickup surface via the electronic component retaining liquid in a state where the wet area is extended.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferable embodiment, a pickup device comprising a conductive layer and an insulation layer laid on the conductive layer a surface of which constitutes the pickup surface is prepared as the pickup device, and an electrolytic solution to which a voltage can be applied between the electrolytic solution and the conductive layer is prepared as the electronic component retaining liquid in the first step, and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">the voltage is set on a low-voltage side in a region where the voltage is applicable so that the wet area of the electrolytic solution on the insulation layer is extended in the second step.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another preferable embodiment, the electrolytic solution is made to contact the electronic component in the state where the wet area of the electrolytic solution onto the insulation layer is extended through setting the voltage on the low-voltage side in the voltage-applicable region so as to weaken a surface tension of the electrolytic solution so that the electronic component is retained on the pickup surface by the surface tension of the electrolytic solution in the second step.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another preferable embodiment, it further comprises a third step for separating the electronic component from the pickup surface in a state where the wet area is narrowed after the second step is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another preferable embodiment, the voltage is set on a high-voltage side in the voltage-applicable region so that the wet area of the electrolytic solution is narrowed in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another preferable embodiment, the electronic component is separated from the pickup surface in the state where the wet area of the electrolytic solution is narrowed by setting the voltage on the high-voltage side in the voltage-applicable region so as to increase the surface tension of the electrolytic solution in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another preferable embodiment, the electrolytic solution is made to contact a point to which the electronic component is transported so that the electronic component is moved from the pickup surface together with the electrolytic solution to the point to be transported in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another preferable embodiment, the second step is implemented after the pickup device is moved to an original position of the electronic component and then</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">the third step is implemented after the pickup device is moved from the original position together with the electronic component to the point to be transported.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet another preferable embodiment, a side length of the electronic component is at most 0.2 mm.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet another preferable embodiment, the point to be transported is a wiring substrate on which the electronic component is mounted, and</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">the electronic component is arranged at a mounting position of the wiring substrate by means of the electronic component transporting method according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another preferable embodiment, it further comprises a fourth step for providing a droplet on the electronic component mounting part prior to the third step, and</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">the electronic component retained by the electrolytic solution is made to contact the droplet and thereby moved to the droplet in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In yet another preferable embodiment, a water-repellent layer is formed on a surface to form the wiring substrate on which the electronic component mounting part except for the electronic component mounting part, and the droplet is then provided on the surface to form the electronic component mounting part in the fourth step.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet another preferable embodiment, the droplet is provided on the electronic component mounting part in a shape corresponding to the electronic component in the fourth step, and</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">the electronic component is arranged at the electronic component mounting part in accordance with a shape of the droplet based on self-aligning in the third step.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An electronic component pickup device according to the present invention is an electronic component pickup device capable of retaining an electronic component in a freely detachable manner, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">a conductive layer;</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention are described referring to the drawings. The inventors of the present invention has examined a problem to be generated in the future based on an accelerated downsizing of an electronic component, namely, a subject matter, so called, transportation and mounting of an electronic component. As a result of the examination, it was known that the electronic component would be further downsized to such a size level that can be hardly held with a holding tool in the future, and it is very difficult at the same time to pick up, transport and mount the electronic component with a vacuum suction mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">It is not necessarily impossible to pick up, transport and mount the electronic component further reduced in comparison to the current sizes if any technical breakthrough is carried out by the improvement of the conventional technology. However, the inventors of the present invention searched a whole new technology in place of merely improving the conventional technology. Various possibilities have been studied and finally it was found that a method of picking up, transporting and mounting the minute electronic component by utilizing a surface tension of a liquid was effective. However, there remained still such an unsolved problem that it is difficult to release the electronic component even if it can be adsorbed by means of the surface tension of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Further, it is also an important issue to control a working time in each step in an actual process. More specifically, it is not applicable merely by realizing the adsorption and release of the electronic component through the surface tension, and a technology for controlling a working time for the adsorption and release to a reasonable level is demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">Based on the before-mentioned aspects, the inventors of the present invention keenly examined a method where not only the surface tension of the liquid was utilized and but also the liquid was speedily controlled, and finally reached the present invention. Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments are described referring to the drawings. In the drawings, constituent elements substantively having a same function are provided with a same reference symbol in order to simplify the description. The present invention is not limited to the following preferred embodiment. Description is given to an electronic component transporting method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> schematically show a constitution of an electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> used in the present preferred embodiment. The electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> described here is a device exclusively used for picking up and retaining an electronic component having a small size such as a chip-type electronic component. The electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> comprises a conductive layer <b>10</b>, an insulation layer <b>12</b>, an electrolytic solution <b>20</b>, a power supply <b>16</b>, a power-supply controller <b>17</b>, and electrodes <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B. The insulation layer <b>12</b> is laminated on the conductive layer <b>10</b> and comprises surface constituting a pickup surface on which the electronic component is retained. The electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is provided on the conductive layer <b>10</b> under a state where the insulation layer <b>12</b> is interposed. The power supply <b>16</b> supplies power to the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b>, and the electrodes <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B are connected to both output ends of the power supply <b>16</b> via a wiring <b>14</b>. The electrode <b>15</b>A is connected to the conductive layer <b>10</b>, and the electrode <b>15</b>B contacts the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. Accordingly, a voltage is applied from the power supply <b>16</b> to the conductive layer <b>10</b> and the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> via the electrodes <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B. The power-supply controller <b>17</b> adjusts the voltage applied from the power supply <b>16</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the power supply <b>16</b> and the power-supply controller <b>17</b> constitute a voltage supply unit, and the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> constitutes an electronic component retaining liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">The electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> utilizes the electro-wetting phenomenon to control a wet area (wettability) of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> on the insulation layer <b>12</b>. The electro-wetting phenomenon is a phenomenon where a surface tension between the electrolytic solution and the substrate surface is changed by changing a charge density in vicinity of a substrate surface contacted by the electrolytic solution, and, as a result, the wet area between the substrate and the electrolytic solution (wettability) is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">In the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> comprising the structure where the electro-wetting phenomenon is generated, the voltage (preferably, direct-current voltage) is applied between the electrodes <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B so that the wet area (wettability) between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the substrate (insulation layer <b>12</b> in the present preferred embodiment) can be changed. As a result, the area on the substrate contacted by the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> can be changed. In the electro-wetting phenomenon, a response speed of the electro-wetting phenomenon (adjusting rate of height of electrolytic solution) is as fast as 10 ms, and the wettability can be more quickly controlled in comparison to the electrophoretic method.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">In the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>on a low-voltage side of a voltage-applicable region of the power supply <b>16</b> or a high-level voltage V<sub>2 </sub>on a high-voltage side thereof (V<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>2</sub>) is applied from the power supply <b>16</b> between the conductive layer <b>10</b> and the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> in the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, when the voltage is increased from V<sub>1 </sub>to V<sub>2</sub>, a charge state on the insulation layer (dielectric layer) <b>12</b> is changed so as to increase a surface tension between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b>. As a result, a wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> on the substrate is reduced and the contact area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is decreased. In the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> according to the present preferred embodiment, the wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is controlled by such an action so that the electronic component is picked up and released. The pickup and release of the electronic component by the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> will be described later in relation to an electronic component transporting device <b>200</b> incorporated the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">Next, the electronic component transporting device <b>200</b> in which the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> is incorporated is described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a constitution of the electronic component transporting device <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the sequent drawings, the conductive layer <b>10</b>, insulation layer <b>12</b>, electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and electrodes <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B are collectively recited as a pickup device main body <b>18</b>. The electronic component transporting device <b>200</b> comprises the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b>, a motor <b>101</b> for moving the pickup device main body (hereinafter, referred to as motor), a component coordinate memory <b>102</b>, a component memory <b>103</b>, a component direction memory <b>104</b> and a controller <b>105</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the motor <b>101</b> for moving the pickup device main body constitutes a mover, and the component coordinate memory <b>102</b>, component memory <b>103</b>, component direction memory <b>104</b> constitute a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">The motor <b>101</b> reciprocates the pickup device main body <b>18</b> between a plurality of transportation positions. The plurality of transportation positions includes a preparatory position of each electronic component (position where the electronic component is stored or the like; hereinafter, referred to as original position &#x3b1;) and a carry-in position of each electronic component (position where the electronic component is mounted; hereinafter, referred to as destination &#x3b2;). The component coordinate memory <b>102</b> memorizes a position information of each electronic component. The position information includes a coordinate information of the original position &#x3b1; of each electronic component and a coordinate information of the destination &#x3b2; of each electronic component. The component memory <b>103</b> includes data in relation to shape, pickup conditions, release conditions and the like of the respective electronic components). The component direction memory <b>104</b> memorizes an information in relation to a direction where an electronic component <b>30</b> is arranged at the original position &#x3b1; and the destination &#x3b2;. The controller <b>105</b> controls the operation of the motor <b>101</b> and the operation of the pickup device main body <b>18</b> based on the information memorized in the component coordinate memory <b>102</b>, component memory <b>103</b> and component direction memory <b>104</b>. In the case where the information in relation to the direction where the electronic component <b>30</b> is arranged at the original position &#x3b1; and the destination &#x3b2; is unnecessary, the component direction memory <b>104</b> is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">The operation of the electronic component transporting device <b>200</b>, that is, the one of the pickup, transportation and release of the electronic component is described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a process drawing illustrating the transportation of the electronic component <b>30</b> by the electronic component transporting device <b>200</b>. First, the controller <b>105</b>, as a pre-processing in picking up the electronic component <b>30</b>, controls the power supply <b>16</b> via the power supply controller <b>17</b> to thereby apply the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the conductive layer <b>10</b>. The low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>to be applied may be a ground voltage. Accordingly, the charge state is changed, which reduces the surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. As a result, the wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> on the insulation layer <b>12</b> becomes such an area that can retain the electronic component on the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> (pickup surface) via the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. In the foregoing state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>), the motor <b>101</b> is activated so that the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is brought closer to the original position &#x3b1; of the electronic component <b>30</b>. Then, the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> of the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is made to contact the electronic component <b>30</b> so that the electronic component <b>30</b> is fetched into the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> by the surface tension thereof and retained on the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> (pickup surface) (see Arrow <b>35</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">After the electronic component <b>30</b> is picked up, the controller <b>105</b> activates the motor <b>101</b> to thereby move the pickup device main body <b>18</b> from the original position &#x3b1; to the destination &#x3b2; of the electronic component <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>). At the time, the low-level voltage is continuously applied. At the destination &#x3b2;, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is arranged immediately above the destination &#x3b2; of the electronic component <b>30</b>. An example of the destination &#x3b2; is an electronic component mounting pattern section on a circuit substrate on which the electronic component <b>30</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">After the transportation operation as described above is carried out, the controller <b>105</b> controls the power-supply controller <b>17</b> to thereby change the voltage to be applied between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the conductive layer <b>10</b> from the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>to the high-level voltage V<sub>2</sub>. Thereby, the charge state is changed, and the surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is thereby increased. As a result, the wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> on the insulation layer <b>12</b> becomes such an area that is difficult to retain the electronic component <b>30</b> on the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> (pickup surface) via the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. The electronic component <b>30</b> is then separated from the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> and moved to the destination &#x3b2; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>c</i>), and the release is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">In the pickup, transportation, release of the electronic component <b>30</b>, the controller <b>105</b> reads the information concerning the original position &#x3b1; and the destination &#x3b2; of the electronic component <b>30</b> to be mounted (coordinate information and the like) from the component coordinate memory <b>102</b>, and the pickup conditions and release conditions of the electronic component <b>30</b> to be mounted from the component memory <b>103</b> respectively, and controls to drive the motor <b>101</b> based on the obtained information.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">A mechanism wherein the electro-wetting phenomenon is utilized to pick up and release the electronic component is described. The wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> in the state where the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is substantially equal to or larger than the size of the electronic component <b>30</b>. A dropping amount of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is set so that the wet area can have such a dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">When the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is made to contact the electronic component <b>30</b> at the original position &#x3b1; in the state where the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied, the electronic component <b>30</b> is adsorbed to the pickup device main body <b>18</b> due to the wettability of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> to the electronic component <b>30</b>. Meanwhile, in the state where the high-level voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is applied to the pickup device main body <b>18</b>, the surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is increased, as a result of which the wet area between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b> is reduced as much as possible so as to become a size smaller than that of the electronic component <b>30</b>. Therefore, when the high-level voltage is applied (V<sub>2</sub>) at the destination &#x3b2;, the electronic component <b>30</b> can hardly be held on the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> (pickup surface) via the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and released to the destination &#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">In addition, when the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is brought closer to the electronic component <b>30</b> in the state where the high-level voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is applied at the original position &#x3b1; on the contrary to the foregoing description, the electronic component <b>30</b> cannot be picked up. At the original position &#x3b1;, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be picked up only in the state where the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>), the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is then transferred from the original position &#x3b1; to the destination &#x3b2; in the state where the electronic component <b>30</b> is adsorbed thereto by the surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> (see Arrow <b>36</b>). At the time, the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is continuously applied. In the example shown, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is transported to an upper position of a wiring substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>c</i>), the electronic component <b>30</b> reached to the destination &#x3b2; is released from the pickup device main body <b>18</b>. In the present example, the electronic component <b>30</b> is released onto a land (electrode) <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the wiring substrate <b>40</b>. When the electronic component <b>30</b> is released, the voltage controller <b>17</b> increases the voltage applied to the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> from the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>to the high-level voltage V<sub>2</sub>. Thereby, the surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is increased, and the wet area between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b> is smaller than the size of the electronic component <b>30</b>. Therefore, it becomes difficult for the electronic component <b>30</b> to be retained on the surface of the insulation layer <b>12</b> (pickup surface) via the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>, and the electronic component <b>30</b> is separated from the insulation layer <b>12</b> due to its own weight or the wettability of the wiring substrate <b>40</b> to the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and moves to the destination &#x3b2; (land <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the wiring substrate <b>40</b> or the like) downward. When the wettability of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> at the destination &#x3b2; is maintained at a favorable level, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be easily moved together with the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> to the destination &#x3b2; (land <b>42</b><i>a</i>). By doing this, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be released from the pickup device main body <b>18</b> to the destination &#x3b2; (land <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the wiring substrate <b>40</b> or the like) in a state where impacts given to the electronic component <b>30</b> and the destination &#x3b2; due to the movement of the electronic component <b>30</b> are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">As described so far, in the present preferred embodiment, pick-up and release process of the electronic component <b>30</b> is implemented by adjusting the wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> in the electronic component main body <b>18</b> by means of the electro-wetting phenomenon. The electronic component <b>30</b> adsorbed to the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is released to the destination &#x3b2; (wiring substrate <b>40</b>) due to change of the wet area. When the electronic component <b>30</b> is released, it is preferable that a droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> is selectively supplied to the destination &#x3b2; and a periphery thereof. Accordingly, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be moved from the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> to the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> while the impacts generated by the fall of the electronic component <b>30</b> are further reduced in the release step. As described earlier, however, even in the structure where the droplet <b>22</b> is not provided at the destination &#x3b2; (land <b>42</b><i>a</i>), the electronic component <b>30</b> can be easily placed on the destination &#x3b2; (land <b>42</b><i>a</i>) together with the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> as far as the favorable wettability of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is obtained at the destination &#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">Next, the pickup process is further described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the electronic components <b>30</b> are stored at the original position &#x3b1; (for example, on the substrate <b>32</b> at the original position), and the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is moved toward one of the electronic components <b>30</b>. At the time, the power-supply controller <b>17</b> applies the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>between the electrode <b>15</b>A on the conductive-layer-<b>10</b> side and the electrode <b>15</b>B on the insulation-layer-<b>12</b> side. Either one or a plurality of electronic components <b>30</b> may be provided on the substrate <b>32</b>. In the shown structure, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is moved downward as shown by Arrow <b>51</b> so that the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is brought closer to the electronic component <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is descended so that the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> contacts the electronic component <b>30</b>. Then, the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> invades into a periphery of the electronic component <b>30</b> by its surface tension, and the electronic component <b>30</b> is thereby drawn closer to the pickup device main body <b>18</b> (more specifically, insulation layer <b>12</b>) via the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and retained.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, when the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is lifted upward as shown by Arrow <b>52</b>, the electronic component <b>30</b> is separated from the substrate <b>32</b> and then moves upward in a state of being retained by the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. At the time, the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is continuously applied. If the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is moved in the foregoing state, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be transported along with the movement.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">Next, the release process is further described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> which is retaining the electronic component <b>30</b> is moved to the destination &#x3b2; (for example, on the substrate <b>34</b> at the destination), and performs positioning to the destination &#x3b2;. An example of the substrate <b>34</b> as the destination &#x3b2; is the wiring substrate <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>c</i>). It is preferable that the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> is selectively supplied to the destination &#x3b2; (or example, position where the component is arranged on the substrate <b>34</b>). The droplet <b>22</b> is preferable to be a liquid having such a property that can be absorbed with the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is moved in a direction shown by Arrow <b>53</b> (downward in the drawing) so as to contact the droplet <b>22</b> on the substrate <b>34</b>. Immediately before the contact, the voltage being applied to the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is increased from the low-level voltage V<sub>1 </sub>to the high-level voltage V<sub>2</sub>. The surface tension of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is thereby reduced, which reduces the wet area between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b>. As a result, the adhesion strength between electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b> is reduced. Therefore, when the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> contacts the droplet <b>22</b>, the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is separated from the insulation layer <b>12</b> and absorbs with the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b>, then, moves to the substrate-<b>34</b> side. Along with the movement of the electrolytic solution <b>12</b>, the electronic component <b>30</b> moves to the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> side on the substrate <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">Next, the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is moved in a direction shown by Arrow <b>54</b> (upward in the drawing) so that the pickup device main body <b>18</b> is completely separated from the electronic component <b>30</b>. Then, the release of the electronic component <b>30</b> is completed. If the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> surrounding the electronic component <b>30</b> is evaporated, the mounting process can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">When the electro-wetting phenomenon is thus utilized, the surface energy (surface tension) of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> to the insulation layer <b>12</b> is adjusted so that the shape of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> can be changed. In the present preferred embodiment, the pickup and the release of the electronic component <b>30</b> are thus realized by adjusting the wet area of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> on the insulation layer <b>12</b> and the component retaining force by the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> by use of the phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">In the pickup process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>, the shape of the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> can be changed by the electro-wetting phenomenon. In the pickup process, however, it is a target to make the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the electronic component <b>30</b> contact each other so as to fetch the electronic component <b>30</b> into the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>. Therefore, the electro-wetting phenomenon may or may not be utilized as far as the electronic component <b>30</b> can be fetched.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">The pickup device main body <b>18</b> is formed from, for example, the following materials. The conductive layer <b>10</b> is formed from metal such as a copper plate or a stainless steel plate.

The insulation layer <b>12</b> is formed from resin, epoxy resin, polyimide resin or the like. In the present preferred embodiment, the insulation layer <b>12</b> is formed from a copper foil coated with epoxy resin.

<p id="p-0104" num="0104">In order to largely reduce the surface tension between the liquid and the insulation film by the application of the relatively low voltage as the high-level voltage V<sub>2 </sub>in the electro-wetting phenomenon, it is necessary to generate a lot of charges on an interface between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b>. Therefore, the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is provided in the present invention. The electrolytic solution <b>20</b> includes a water-soluble electrolytic solution (for example, 1 mM of KC1 or the like) or an organic solvent. The electrolytic solution <b>20</b> can consist of a mixture of a water solution and an organic solvent (for example, water and alcohol), and a two-phase substance (for example, it may be solved by alcohol such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, ethyleneglycol, and glycerin, ether such as ethyleneglycol ethylether or ethyleneglycol monobutylether, ketons such as methylethylketone, or alkane such as hexan, octane or nonane). As examples of the water-soluble electrolytic solution, there are NaCl water solution, NaBr water solution, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl water solution, buffer solution including various salts, and the like other than the foregoing examples. In the electrolytic solution in which the organic solvent is used, acetic anhydride, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, propylene carbonate, nitromethane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, or hexamethyl phosphoamide can be used as the solvent, and NaClO<sub>4</sub>, LiClO<sub>4</sub>, KOH, KOCH<sub>3</sub>, NaOCH<sub>3</sub>, LiCl , NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, n-(CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Ni, Mg (ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaBF<sub>4 </sub>or the like can be used as the electrolytic substance. Further, an alcohol-based solvent, various esters, aliphatic carbon hydride, cycloaliphatic carbon hydride, aromatic carbon hydride or halogenated carbon hydride including a small amount of water-soluble electrolytic solution, or various types of oils can be also used. The amount of salt or electrolytic substance is not particularly limited as far as the electro-wetting phenomenon can be generated. For example, the amount is at least 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>weight % and at most 30 weight %.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">The droplet <b>22</b> may consist of either an electrolytic solution or liquid other than the electrolytic solution.

The electronic component mounting device <b>300</b> comprises the transporting device <b>200</b>, an operation/display unit <b>301</b> and a stage movement motor <b>302</b>. The operation/display unit <b>301</b> accepts an operation by an operator who handles the electronic component mounting device <b>300</b>, and displays various information that the operator demands in the operation.

First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the wiring substrate <b>40</b>, which is the destination of the electronic component <b>30</b> (where the electronic component is mounted), is prepared. Wiring patterns <b>42</b> are previously formed on the wiring substrate <b>40</b>. The wiring substrate <b>40</b> may be a rigid substrate or a flexible substrate. Further, the wiring substrate <b>40</b> is not necessarily limited to a one-surface wiring substrate or a both-surface wiring substrate, and may be a multi-layer wiring substrate. A wiring substrate such as a component-incorporated substrate and a rigid flexible substrate may be used as the wiring substrate <b>40</b>. It is needless to say that a circuit substrate on which the electronic component is already mounted can be used as the wiring substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a water-repellent layer (water-repellent pattern) <b>43</b> is formed on the wiring substrate <b>40</b> except for the destination &#x3b2; (mounting position). The water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is formed so that the droplet <b>22</b> can be surely and easily formed at the destination &#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">The water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is formed from photosensitive water/oil-repellent resin. The water-repellent layer <b>43</b> according to the present preferred embodiment is formed from a UV-hardening resist film manufactured by NIPPON PAINT COL, LTD. Silicon and acrylic block polymer constitute the material, and more specifically, the material has a sea-island structure of silicon and acryl (so-called silicon island). The silicon is characterized in its low surface tension, and the acryl serves to control modification, hardness, adhesion, UV-curing of the resin. A contact angle between the formed water-repellent layer <b>43</b> and water is 100&#xb0;-105&#xb0;, and liquid (water or the like) provided on the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> has a fall angle of 20&#xb0;-40&#xb0; when the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is tilted. A contact angle in the wettability of the liquid (water or the like) in the region where the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is removed is 40&#xb0;-45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">The water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is formed, for example, as follows. An entire surface of the wiring substrate <b>40</b> is coated with a water-repellent material. More specifically, spin coating is adopted to apply the water-repellent material in a thickness of 1-2 &#x3bc;m. Next, the applied water-repellent material is pre-baked (for 30 minutes at 120&#xb0; C.), and then exposed so as to have a predetermined pattern. The exposure is conducted in 300 mj/cm<sup>2 </sup>by means of UV. Next, the exposed material is baked for 30 minutes at 120&#xb0; C., and dipped in toluene for 1-2 minutes and developed. When a post baking process is finally applied at 120&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes, the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">When the fluorine/acrylic block polymer manufactured by ASAHI GLASS CO., LTD. is used as the photosensitive water/oil-repellent resin, the water-repellent layer (water-repellent pattern) <b>43</b> having the water/oil-repellent property can be formed by means of the photolithographic process with the i beam.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the droplet <b>22</b> is formed on the wiring substrate <b>40</b> on which the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is formed. Formation of the droplet is carried out as below. The droplet <b>22</b> is formed on the wiring substrate <b>40</b> except for the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> when a liquid for the droplet <b>22</b> is sprayed on the entire wiring substrate <b>40</b>. The droplets <b>22</b> do not cause any problem in the mounting of the electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">The droplet <b>22</b> may be formed by means of a method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in place of the spray. More specifically, the liquid <b>24</b> for forming the droplet <b>22</b> is dropped on the entire surface of the wiring substrate <b>40</b>, and then, a slide plate (for example, slide glass) <b>26</b> is made to contact the liquid <b>24</b>. The slide plate <b>26</b> is arranged in parallel with the wiring substrate <b>40</b> in a state where a predetermined small interval is formed between them. As a result, the liquid <b>24</b> is spread onto the entire surface of the wiring substrate <b>40</b>. Then, the slide plate <b>26</b> is slid in parallel with the wiring substrate <b>40</b> under the state (see Arrow <b>27</b>).

<p id="p-0115" num="0115">After the droplet <b>22</b> is formed, the electronic component <b>30</b> is transported from the original position &#x3b1; to the destination &#x3b2; (a part on the wiring substrate <b>40</b> where the water-repellent layer <b>43</b> is not formed) by the electronic component mounting device <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. After that, the electronic component <b>30</b> is transported to the destination &#x3b2; on the wiring substrate <b>40</b> and mounted thereon by means of the method described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>. When the electronic component <b>30</b> is mounted, the droplet (liquid) <b>22</b> surrounding the electronic component <b>30</b> transported to the destination &#x3b2; is evaporated, the electronic component <b>30</b> can be mounted on the wiring substrate <b>40</b>.

The electronic component <b>30</b> can be arranged in any desired direction in the droplet <b>22</b>, that is, at the destination &#x3b2; by forming the opening part <b>43</b><i>a </i>in such a shape.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">In the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the electronic component <b>30</b> housed in the droplet <b>22</b> is moved/rotated by the surface tension of the droplet <b>22</b> as shown by Arrow <b>60</b>, and located at the center of the droplet <b>22</b> (or center of the opening part <b>43</b><i>a</i>) by the self-aligning as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Thereby, position of the electronic component <b>30</b> is adjusted so that the direction of the electronic component <b>30</b> corresponds to that of the opening part <b>43</b><i>a</i>.

When the pickup device <b>19</b>&#x2032; is moved to the original position &#x3b1; in the foregoing state so that the electronic component <b>30</b> contacts the electrolytic solution <b>20</b>, the electronic component <b>30</b> is picked up by the pickup device <b>19</b> in a random state without fixing the direction thereof due to the direction thereof in an initial stage of the pickup, various pickup conditions, environmental conditions and the like.

Further, it is assumed that the interval angle of the satellite electrode <b>15</b>C<sub>2</sub>-<b>15</b>C<sub>9 </sub>is 45&#xb0;, and the direction of the electronic component <b>30</b> is controlled at the interval of 45&#xb0;, however, any other angle position may be adopted. For example, the interval angle of the satellite electrodes <b>15</b>C<sub>2</sub>-<b>15</b>C<sub>5 </sub>is set to 90&#xb0;, and the direction of the electronic component <b>30</b> is controlled at the interval of 90&#xb0; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">In the control of the direction of the electronic component <b>30</b> described above, it is preferable that the conductive layer <b>10</b> and the insulation layer <b>12</b> are constituted in a manner similar to the electrode <b>15</b>C. However, a similar effect can be obtained in the case where only the electrode <b>15</b>C alone is constituted as described.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">The electronic component <b>30</b> used in the present preferred embodiment is preferable to be an electronic component having a small size, and, for example, an electronic component <b>30</b> having a side whose length is at most 0.2 mm is suitably used. Examples of the electronic component <b>30</b> are a chip component (for example, chip capacitor, chip inductor, or chip resistor) and a semiconductor element (for example, semiconductor bare chip).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">In the case where the electronic component <b>30</b> is the chip component, the method according to the present preferred embodiment can be suitably applied to a component having the size of &#x201c;0402&#x201d; which is currently the smallest size, and even to a component having a size smaller than that, for example, a component having a side whose length is at most 0.1 mm (&#x201c;01005&#x201d; or the like). In the case where the electronic component <b>30</b> is the semiconductor bare chip, the method can be suitably applied to a semiconductor bare chip having the size of 0.3 mm in square, which is currently the smallest size, and a semiconductor bare chip having a side whose length is at most 0.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">Though the present invention exerts a remarkable effect to a minute size of the electronic component <b>30</b> which was hardly picked up or could not be picked up according to the conventional technology, however, it is needless to say that the effect of the present invention is not limited to such a minute component. The electronic component <b>30</b> to which the present invention is applied does not necessarily be limited to such a micro size because such effects as the superior response speed of the electronic component pickup device <b>100</b> and the movement between the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> and the droplet <b>22</b> can be utilized. The electronic component pickup device in which the chip is held with the holding tool involves the risk of breaking the electronic component, however, the constitution according to the present invention can accurately mount the electronic component without any breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">The present invention was thus far described based on the preferred embodiments, and the recitations so far are not subject to any limitation and can be variously modified. In the preferred embodiments, a method of using the electrolytic solution <b>20</b> is described in the pickup and transporting method in which the electro-wetting phenomenon is utilized. In the case where solder powder is used in addition to the electrolytic solution, as the electrolytic solution is vaporized, and the solder powder is dissolved through re-flowing after mounting of the electronic component, the electronic component and the desired wiring pattern on the wiring substrate can be electrically connected to each other. A solder plating such as Sn is previously applied to the electrode on the wiring substrate so that the solder plating of the electrode of the electronic component is dissolved at the time of the reflow and electrically connected to the electrode on the wiring substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0130">Further, though it is essentially different from the technology according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, there is a component transporting device in which a surface tension of liquid is utilized, as recited in the Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open (No. H11-68388, No. 2004-108907, No. 2005-33014). However, the inventions recited in these documents do not disclose the transportation of the component in such a manner that the component is held by means of the electro-wetting phenomenon, and the technical ideas are quite different from that of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0131">Though the preferred embodiments of this invention have been described in detail, it will be understood that various modifications may be made therein, and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention.</p>
