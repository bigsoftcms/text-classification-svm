<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a stable secondary battery with a higher energy density and to an active material used therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As markets for a note-type personal computer and a mobile telephone have been rapidly expanded, there have been increased needs to a small and large-capacity secondary battery with a higher energy density used in these devices. To satisfy the needs, a secondary battery has been developed, which utilizes an electrochemical reaction associated with charge transfer on alkali-metal ions as a charge carrier such as lithium ions. Among others, a lithium-ion secondary battery has been used in a variety of electronic devices as a stable and large-capacity secondary battery with a higher energy density.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a lithium-ion secondary battery uses a transition-metal oxide containing lithium in a positive electrode (cathode) and carbon in a negative electrode (anode) as active materials, and performs charge and discharge utilizing insertion in and elimination from these active materials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since the lithium-ion secondary battery uses a metal oxide with a large specific gravity particularly in a positive electrode, it has an insufficient secondary battery capacity per a unit weight. There have been, therefore, attempts for developing a large-capacity secondary battery using a lighter electrode material. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,833,048 and 2,715,778 have disclosed a secondary battery using an organic compound having a disulfide bond in a positive electrode, which utilizes, as a principle of a secondary battery, an electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction associated with formation and dissociation of a disulfide bond. The secondary battery uses electrode materials comprising elements having a smaller specific gravity such as sulfur and carbon as main components. Although these materials are effective to some degree in providing a large-capacity secondary battery with a higher energy density, it has a small efficiency in reformation of a dissociated bond and exhibits insufficient stability in a charge or discharge condition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, there has been suggested a secondary battery also utilizing an organic compound, i.e., a secondary battery using a conductive polymer as an electrode material. It is a secondary battery whose principle is doping and undoping reactions of electrolyte ions on the conductive polymer. The doping reaction as used herein is a reaction of stabilizing excitons such as charged solitons and polarons generated by oxidation or reduction of a conductive polymer by counter ions. On the other hand, a undoping reaction as used herein refers to a reaction which is opposite to the above reaction and in which excitons stabilized by counter ions are electrochemically oxidized or reduced. U.S. Pat. No. 4,442,187 has disclosed a secondary battery using such a conductive polymer as a positive electrode or negative electrode material. The secondary battery is constituted with elements with a lower specific gravity such as carbon and nitrogen, and thus has been expected to be developed as a large-capacity secondary battery. A conductive polymer, however, has a property that excitons generated by oxidation or reduction are delocalized over a wide region of <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.56mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US07642011-20100105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>-electron conjugated system and interacted with each other. It results in a limitation to a concentration of excitons generated, and therefore, to a capacity of a secondary battery. Thus, a secondary battery using a conductive polymer as an electrode material is effective to some degree in terms of weight reduction, but is not adequately effective in terms of increase in a capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As described above, there have been various proposals for a secondary battery which does not use a transition-metal containing active material, in an attempt to achieve a large-capacity secondary battery. There have been, however, provided no stable secondary batteries with a higher energy density and a large capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, in a lithium-ion secondary battery using a transition metal oxide as a positive electrode, a specific gravity of the element is so high that it has been theoretically difficult to prepare a secondary battery with a larger capacity than that currently used. An objective of this invention is, therefore, to provide a novel stable secondary battery with a higher energy density and a larger capacity.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">This invention provides a secondary battery on the basis of a novel mechanism that a radical compound is used as an electrode active material. When the radical compound consists of lighter materials such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, it may be expected to provide a secondary battery with a high energy density per a weight. Furthermore, since only a radical site contributes a reaction in a secondary battery, this invention may provide a stable secondary battery whose cycle properties are independent of diffusion of the active material. In addition, since a reactive unpaired electron is localized on a radical atom in a radical compound, a concentration of the reactive site may be increased to provide a large-capacity secondary battery. This invention may be suitably applied to a secondary battery or active material for a secondary battery which performs charge and discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">An electrode active material as used herein refers to a material directly contributing to an electrode reaction such as charge and discharge reactions, and plays a main role in a secondary battery system. An active material in this invention may be used as either a positive electrode or negative electrode active material, but it may be more preferably used as a positive electrode active material because it is characterized by a light weight and has a good energy density in comparison with a metal oxide system.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the light of stability, it is preferable that among electrode reactions in a positive electrode, an electrode reaction during discharge is that in which a radical compound is a reactant. Furthermore, when the reaction is that in which a reaction product may form a bond with an electrolyte cation, much more improvement in stability may be expected. Any type of electrolyte cations may be used, and in particular, a lithium ion is preferable in the light of a capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As used herein, a reactant refers to a substance which is subject to a chemical reaction and stably exists for a long time, while a product refers to a substance formed as a result of a chemical reaction which stable exists for a long time. In this invention, a reactant or product is a radical compound. This invention, therefore, does not encompass a system in which a radical is formed for a quite short time as a reaction intermediate in the course of an electrode reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">According to a statistical mechanical theory, any chemical substance would contain radical-form species at room temperature. In this invention, it is, however, important that radicals exist to an extent where they may function as an active material in a secondary battery. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,715,778 has indicated organic compounds such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and a disulfide as an electrode active material, whose radical concentration is about 10<sup>18 </sup>spin/g.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In general, a radical concentration may be expressed as a spin concentration. That is, a spin concentration means the number of unpaired electrons (radicals) per a unit weight, which is determined by, for example, the following procedure from an absorption area intensity in an electron spin resonance spectrum (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;ESR&#x201d; spectrum). First, a sample to be measured by ESR spectroscopy is pulverized by grinding it in, for example, a mortar, whereby the sample may be ground to a particle size in which skin effect, i.e., a phenomenon that microwave does not penetrate a sample, can be ignored. A given amount of the pulverized sample is filled in a quartz glass capillary with an inner diameter of 2 mm or less, preferably 1 to 0.5 mm, vacuumed to 10-5 mmHg or less, sealed and subject to ESR spectroscopy. ESR spectroscopy may be conducted using an apparatus such as Model JEOL-JES-FR30 ESR spectrometer. A spin concentration may be determined by integrating twice an ESR signal obtained and comparing it to a calibration curve. There are no restrictions to a spectrometer or measuring conditions as long as a spin concentration can be accurately determined. As described above, a spin concentration for a radical compound may be evaluated by, for example, electron spin resonance spectroscopy. A charge state in a radical compound is preferably neutral in the light of easy charge/discharge reactions. For stability of a secondary battery, a radical compound is desirably stable. A stable radical as used herein refers to a compound whose radical form has a long life. A longer radical life is better, but it depends on various factors such as reactivity of the radical itself and ambient conditions such as a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">A radical is a chemical species with an unpaired electron and a compound having the chemical species is a radical compound. A radical is generally highly reactive and is frequently an unstable species generated as an intermediate in a variety of reactions. Such an unstable radical forms a bond with a surrounding substance present in a reaction system and disappears in a certain life.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Some of stable radicals, however, do not form a bond with a surrounding substance and stably exist for a relatively longer period. These compounds stabilize a radical by steric hindrance with an organic protective group or delocalization of a <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="3.56mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US07642011-20100105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>-electron. An electrode active material of this invention utilizes such a compound generally exhibiting a spin concentration of 10<sup>19 </sup>to 10<sup>23 </sup>spins/g determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy for a long period, e.g., 1 sec or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In particular, a stable radical compound herein is a compound in which a spin concentration of 10<sup>21 </sup>spins/g or more in an equilibrium state is kept for 1 sec or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">A radical compound herein is a compound having an unpaired electron as a uncombined hand and thus does not encompass a transition metal compound having a stable unpaired electron in its inner shell.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Generally, an electrode active material in a secondary battery may take either an oxidized or reduced form depending on its starting state and an electrode reaction, and this invention is wherein the active material comprises a radical compound either in a starting state or in an oxidized or reduced state. A charge/discharge mechanism is not clearly understood, but may be assumed that a radical group in an active material would be reversibly changed into a radical or ion state by an electrode reaction for accumulating charge. Furthermore, this invention is wherein an oxy radical compound directly contributes to an electrode reaction in a positive electrode or negative electrode, and therefore, an electrode used as an active material is not limited to one of the positive electrode and the negative electrode. A radical compound is, however, preferably used as an electrode active material in a positive electrode in the light of an energy density. For stability, an electrode reaction during discharge among electrode reactions in a positive electrode is that in which a radical compound is a reactant. Furthermore, when a product in this reaction forms a bond with a cation of an electrolyte salt, further improvement in stability may be expected. There are herein no restrictions to the electrolyte cation, but a lithium ion is preferable in the light of a capacity.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The electrode reaction in the above (ii) may be a discharge reaction in which a radical compound is a reactant or product. A discharge reaction in which a radical compound is a reactant may be, for example, that forming a bond between a radical compound and an electrolyte cation. A discharge reaction in which a radical compound is a product may be, for example, that cleaving a bond between a radical compound and an electrolyte cation.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Examples of a radical compound used in this invention include the nitroxyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 1 to 3; the polymer nitroxyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 4 to 6; the phenoxyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 7 and 8; the polymer phenoxyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 9 and 10; the hydrazyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 11 to 13; the hydrazyl radical compounds represented by chemical formulas 14 and 15; carbon radical compounds; sulfur radical compounds; and boron radical compounds. It may be a low-molecular weight or polymer compound. It may be a polymer compound in which one of the above compound is present. Furthermore, two or more radical compounds may be mixed. As shown in chemical formula 16, a substance forming a radical compound by releasing lithium by charging may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">A polymer compound as used herein is an aggregate of polymers having a large molecular weight, exhibiting insolubility in a variety of solvents due to its intermolecular interaction compared to a low molecular weight compound. Therefore, when a secondary battery is formed using a polymer radical compound, elution from an electrode may be minimized to provide good stability. It is necessary in this invention that a radical compound as an active material is retained on the electrode during charging/discharging. The radical compound is, therefore, preferably insoluble in a basic solvent constituting an electrolyte solution. However, when forming a large-capacity secondary battery, the amount of an electrolyte or electrolyte solution to an active material is so small that an insoluble radical compound with a solubility of about 1 g or less (the amount (grams) of a solute to 100 g of a solvent) may be stably retained on the electrode.</p>

<p id="p-0215" num="0214">An oxy radical compound as an active material in a secondary battery according to this invention may be a solid or a solution, without any restriction in terms of operation. It is, however, preferably insoluble in a basic solvent in the light of a rate and an efficiency in charge/discharge. There are no restrictions to a molecular weight of an oxy radical compound in this invention, and a variety of molecular weight may be thus acceptable from a compound with a low molecular weight to a polymer compound. However, a polymer is preferable in the light of stability of its charged or discharged state, particularly a polymer radical compound having a polyolefin, polyacetylene, polyphenylene or five-membered aromatic heterocycle structure, most preferably a polymer radical compound having a three-dimensional network structure. Examples of a compound having a polyolefin structure are the polymer compounds shown in chemical formulas B10 to 11 and their derivatives. Examples of a compound having a polyacetylene structure are the polymer compounds shown in chemical formulas B12 to 15 and their derivatives.

<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In this invention, there are no restrictions to a molecular weight of a compound having a radical on a nitrogen atom and thus a compound with a low molecular weight from a polymer compound may be used as necessary. A polymer compound generally has a lower solubility in an electrolyte solution compared with a compound with a low molecular weight, so that a capacity reduction due to dissolution in the electrolyte solution is smaller. Examples of a polymer compound include those having any of the structures represented by chemical formulas C18 to C28, C31 and C32, as well as polymer compounds having a polyolefin, polyacetylene, polyphenylene or five-membered aromatic heterocycle structure. The polymer compound may have a three-dimensional network structure. A compound having a radical on a nitrogen atom as an active material in a secondary battery in this invention may be solid or may be dissolved or dispersed in an electrolyte. When using as a solid, it may be preferably insoluble or poorly soluble in an electrolyte solution because capacity reduction due to dissolution in an electrolyte solution may be minimized. A compound having a radical on a nitrogen atom as an active material in a secondary battery in this invention is generally used alone, or in combination of two or more or another type of active material.</p>

To the mixture was added 1130 mg of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was dissolved to prepare a solution of a gel electrolyte in tetrahydrofuran.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">In a separate glass vessel was placed 30 mg of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidoxyl radical (TEMPO radical) having the molecular structure represented by chemical formula 1, which is a nitroxyl radical compound, as a radical compound, then 60 mg of graphite powder as a conductive adjuvant and then 200 mg of the above solution of a gel electrolyte in tetrahydrofuran as an ion-conductive adjuvant, and the mixture was blended. To the mixture was added 1000 mg of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture was further blended until it became homogeneous to provide a black slurry. Then, 200 mg of the slurry was added dropwise on the surface of an aluminum foil (area: 1.5 cm&#xd7;1.5 cm, thickness: 100 &#x3bc;m) with a lead, and the slurry was spread using a wire bar such that the overall surface became even. It was left for 60 min at room temperature to evaporate the solvent, tetrahydrofuran, and to form an organic compound layer containing TEMPO radical on the aluminum foil.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">An aliquot of the applied film was taken, ground and subject to electron spin resonance spectroscopy.

An absorption area intensity was determined by integrating twice a first derivation type of ESR spectrum obtained as described above and compared with an absorption area intensity for a known sample measured under the same conditions to determine a spin concentration. As a result, a spin concentration was 10<sup>21 </sup>spin/g or higher, indicating formation of a radical in an initial state.</p>

<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In a dry box equipped with a gas purifier were mixed 60 mg of a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene and 140 mg of an electrolyte solution which was a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate containing 1 mol/L of LiPF<sub>6 </sub>electrolyte salt under an atmosphere of argon gas. To the mixture was added 1130 mg of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was dissolved to prepare a solution of a gel electrolyte in tetrahydrofuran. In a separate glass vessel was placed 30 mg of diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, then 60 mg of graphite powder as a conductive adjuvant and then 200 mg of the above solution of a gel electrolyte in tetrahydrofuran as an ion-conductive adjuvant, and the mixture was blended. To the mixture was added 1000 mg of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture was further stirred for 3 hours to provide a black slurry. Then, 200 mg of the slurry was added dropwise on the surface of an aluminum foil (area: 1.5 cm&#xd7;1.5 cm, thickness: 100 &#x3bc;m) with a lead, and the slurry was spread using a wire bar such that the overall surface became even. It was left for 3 hours at room temperature to substantially evaporate the solvent, tetrahydrofuran, and to form an electrode layer containing diphenylpicrylhydrazyl on the aluminum foil.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">To 600 mg of a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene were added 1400 mg of an electrolyte solution, i.e., a 1:1 mixed solution of ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate containing 1 mol/L of LiPF6 as an electrolyte salt and 11.3 g of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. After dissolving the copolymer of vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene, the solution was applied on a glass plate with a glass frame. The plate was dried in the air to evaporate tetrahydrofuran to provide a cast film with a thickness of 300 &#x3bc;m on the glass plate.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The gel electrolyte film cut by 2.0 cm&#xd7;2.0 cm was laminated on the aluminum foil on which diphenylpicrylhydrazyl had been formed. On the foil was then laminated a copper foil having a lithium film with a lead (thickness: 30 &#x3bc;m for the lithium film and 20 &#x3bc;m for the copper foil). The whole product was sandwiched with polytetrafluoroethylene sheets with a thickness of 5 mm and was pressed to provide a secondary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">For the secondary battery thus prepared, discharge with a constant current of 0.1 mA was conducted using the electrode layer containing diphenylpicrylhydrazyl as a positive electrode and the copper foil with a lithium film as a negative electrode. A voltage was constant at about 2.5 V for about 5 hours and it took additional 12 hours for a voltage to be reduced to 1 V or less. It was found that a voltage was kept constant at about 2.5 V after 10 cycles of charge/discharge, indicating that the battery acted as a secondary battery. A part of the positive electrode layer cut from the sample after discharge was subject to electron spin resonance spectroscopy to give a spin concentration of 10<sup>19 </sup>spin/g or less. It would be because diphenylpicrylhydrazyl was converted into a compound without a radical in an electrode reaction during discharge. It was thought that diphenylpicrylhydrazyl acted as an active material in the positive electrode for action of the secondary battery.</p>
