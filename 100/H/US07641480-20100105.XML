<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A connector assembly is disclosed for coupling a signal wire bundle from a controller console to a hand-operated catheter assembly. The connector includes a female connector component having a cylindrical cavity, wire fingers disposed within the cylindrical cavity, a guide peg disposed on a surface of the cylindrical cavity at a point proximate an opening of the cylindrical cavity, and a central pin disposed on a base surface at a closed end of the cylindrical cavity. The connector also includes a male connector component having a substantially cylindrical shape having a non-uniform transverse cross-section radius. The male connector component comprises a set of signal leads disposed along arcs of a cylindrical surface of the male connector, a slot defined within the male connector's surface is arranged to accept the guide peg of the female connector component and constrain the relative positions of the male connector and female connector during engagement.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound catheters have been designed for use inside many areas of the human body. In the cardiovascular system, two common diagnostic ultrasound methods are intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Typically a single rotating transducer or an array of transducer elements is used to transmit ultrasound at the tips of the catheters. The same transducers (or separate transducers) are used to receive echoes from the tissue. A signal generated from the echoes is transferred to a console which allows for the processing, storing, display, or manipulation of the ultrasound-related data.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">IVUS catheters are typically used in the large and small blood vessels (arteries or veins) of the body, and are almost always delivered over a guidewire having a flexible tip. ICE catheters are usually used to image the chambers of the heart and surrounding structures. Commercially-available ICE catheters are not designed to be delivered over a guidewire, but instead have distal ends which can be articulated by a steering mechanism located in a handle at the proximal end of the catheter. Examples of ICE catheters include ones provided by EP Medsystems (ViewFlex&#x2122; Intracardiac Ultrasound Deflectable catheter) and Siemens/ACUSON (AcuNav&#x2122; Ultrasound Catheter). Both the ViewFlex and the AcuNav catheters utilize a linear array of multiple transducer elements, e.g., 64 elements, at their tips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The large number of signal channels present in the cables connecting an ICE catheter transducer assembly to a controller console raises substantial design challenges. Interconnecting a cable from the non-sterile field to an ICE catheter assembly handle should be accomplished using a connector assembly that, in addition to maintaining the sterile field, provides: low engagement/mating force, reliable alignment/mating of corresponding signal leads, and a secure connection after mating. These objectives are supplemented by additional objectives such as: small size, low mass, durability (multiple mate/de-mate cycles), low cost, complete coverage/sealing of contacting wires, and simple mating action.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A barrel connector for coupling a signal wire bundle from a controller console to a hand-operated catheter assembly is disclosed. More particularly a multi-wire barrel connector is described herein for coupling a signal wire bundle from a controller console to a hand-operated catheter assembly. The multi-wire barrel connector includes a female connector component having a cylindrical cavity. In addition the female connector component includes a set of wire fingers disposed within the cylindrical cavity. The set of wire fingers provide points of termination for a set of signal lines. The female connector component includes a guide peg disposed on a surface of the cylindrical cavity at a point proximate an opening of the cylindrical cavity. The female connector also includes a central pin disposed on a base surface at a closed end of the cylindrical cavity. The central pin extends from the base surface along a central axis of the cylindrical cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The multi-wire barrel connector also includes a male connector component having a substantially cylindrical shape having a non-uniform transverse cross-section radius. The male connector component comprises a set of signal leads disposed along arcs of a cylindrical surface of the male connector. The set of signal leads are disposed along a majority of a length of the male connector component. The male connector includes a slot defined within the male connector's surface. The slot is arranged to accept the guide peg of the female connector component and constrain the relative positions of the male connector and female connector during engagement. The slot comprises at least a first segment running lengthwise along the male connector and a second segment guiding rotational engagement between the set of wire fingers and the set of signal leads. Finally, rotational lock structures incorporated into the female and male connector components ensure full engagement between the male connector and female connector component is maintained after rotating the male connector and female connector components into a fully engaged relationship.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The following embodiments are related to an ultrasound catheter assembly <b>10</b> that utilizes a barrel connector assembly wherein a set of exposed contacts on a male connector component contact a corresponding set of wire fingers carried by a female connector component's inner cylindrical surface. For purposes of illustration, the ultrasound catheter assembly <b>10</b> is described in the context of an ultrasound catheter system for use as an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter. Other applications of the disclosed catheter assembly are contemplated in alternative embodiments. The connector described herein incorporates a barrel design characterized by a substantially cylindrical space defining the complimentary male and female components of the connector joining a multi-wire (e.g., approximately 64 line) signal line set from a controller console to a corresponding signal line set for an array of (64) transducer elements. The transducer elements make up a transducer array incorporated into an ICE catheter assembly. In the illustrative example, the male component comprises a multi-piece assembly that, when placed together, form a cylindrical-shaped member. In an exemplary embodiment, a pair of flex circuits, each comprising a set of (32) signal lines deposited on a flexible substrate, are affixed to one or more pieces of the multi-piece assembly. Contacts for the signal lines of the flexible substrate are located on an outer surface of the cylindrical-shaped member of the male component.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The female connector component of the barrel connector assembly includes a complimentary cylindrical cavity. In an exemplary embodiment, a set of (64) signal leads terminate within the female component at two sets of (32) parallel wire fingers. The wire fingers are, in turn, connected to signal lines coupled to a control console signal interface. The wire fingers are trailing (dragging) in nature and exert enough force on the corresponding male contacts to ensure constant contact while the ICE catheter assembly is in operation. The wire fingers thus exert minimal force to minimize wear on a re-usable portion of the connector components. In an exemplary embodiment the re-usable connector component is the female component. In alternative embodiments the male component is the reused component of the barrel connector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Guides are built into the male and female components to ensure proper engagement of male component contacts and corresponding ones of the wire fingers when the male component is inserted into and then rotated within the female component. In the exemplary embodiment a guide pin extends from a bottom of the female component's cylindrical cavity. The guide pin enters an axial shaft within the male component. The guide pin operates as a pivot point during rotation of the male component and female component to affect an electrically conductive connection between the contacts and corresponding wire fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The 64 exposed contacts of the male component engage the corresponding ones of the 64 wire fingers of the female component when the male component is inserted into and then rotated only a small amount, less than a quarter turn, within the female component. Proper alignment of the male component's contacts and the female component's wire fingers is facilitated, in an illustrative embodiment, by a combination of a guide peg and corresponding channel/slot. The peg matches a side opening in the corresponding channel/slot. When the male component is initially inserted, the channel guides the peg to ensure that the wire fingers of the female component are not damaged during insertion. When the male component has been inserted to a proper depth in the female component, a second portion of the channel, running along an arc of the outer cylindrical surface of the male component, guides the peg to ensure the contacts and the wire fingers are properly aligned as the male and female components are rotated toward a fully engaged position. The male and female components are described further herein below with reference to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27</figref>, <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, and <b>29</b>, after first describing an exemplary ICE catheter assembly with which the above-described connector is advantageously used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustratively depicts an embodiment of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> including a catheter shaft <b>12</b>. The catheter shaft <b>12</b> is a generally flexible elongate member having a distal segment <b>14</b>, a proximal segment <b>16</b>, and at least one lumen (not shown). The proximal segment <b>16</b> is attached to a handle <b>18</b>. The handle <b>18</b> includes, by way of example, a housing <b>20</b>, a first in-line steering actuator <b>22</b> (e.g., a knob), and a second steering actuator <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first and second actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are manipulated by a user moving an exposed control surface of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (using a finger/thumb) lengthwise along the length of the housing <b>20</b> of the handle <b>18</b> (as opposed to across the width of the handle <b>18</b>). As used herein the term &#x201c;lengthwise along the housing&#x201d; includes the arrangement depicted in the exemplary embodiments (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b> and <b>25</b>) as well as other arrangements where the movement of an exposed control surface of the actuators is primarily along the lengthwise axis of the handle <b>18</b> (e.g., tilted by 30 degrees). &#x201c;Exposed control surface&#x201d; refers to a portion of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> that is physically accessible to a user's finger/thumb through, for example, an opening in the housing <b>20</b>. Furthermore, a variety of actuator mechanisms are envisioned for actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in alternative embodiments. In the illustrative embodiment, the first actuator <b>22</b> and second actuator <b>24</b> comprise rotatable knobs that rotate on an axis that is transverse to the lengthwise axis of the handle <b>18</b> when a user moves a thumb along the handle <b>18</b>'s length. In alternative embodiments, thumb-controlled slider actuators replace the rotating knobs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The distal segment <b>14</b> is, by way of example, 10 cm long. However, an exemplary range for the length of the distal segment <b>14</b> is from 5 cm to 20 cm. A tip of the distal segment <b>14</b> has a generally smaller diameter than the diameter of the proximal segment <b>16</b> of the catheter shaft. The catheter shaft <b>12</b> is made, by way of example, of engineered nylon (such as Pebax&#xae; polyether block amide) and includes a tube or tubing, alternatively called a catheter tube or catheter tubing that has at least one lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrative example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first and second steering actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are accessible (have exposed control surfaces through the housing <b>20</b>) on two sides of the handle <b>18</b>. A potential advantage of the depicted arrangement of the steering actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is the ability of a user to control the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with a same hand that is holding the handle <b>18</b>. A strain relief <b>26</b> protects the catheter shaft <b>12</b> at a point where the catheter shaft proximal segment <b>16</b> meets the handle <b>18</b>. A cable <b>28</b> connects the handle <b>18</b> to a connector <b>30</b>. The connector <b>30</b>, which can be any of many possible configurations, is configured to interconnect with an ultrasound system for processing, storing, manipulating, and displaying data obtained from signals generated by a sensor mounted at the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>8</b> illustrate a first embodiment of an ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> incorporating a handle and knob-based actuator control mechanism that supports single-handed position manipulation/control by a user of a sensor mounted at the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> includes a rotatable tip <b>34</b> that extends from the distal segment <b>14</b> and rotates relative to an axis of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. The catheter shaft <b>12</b> has a lumen <b>47</b> as illustrated more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the illustrative embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref> the rotatable tip <b>34</b> comprises a transducer probe assembly including transducers and a flex circuit. By way of example, the rotatable tip <b>34</b> comprises a linearly arranged transducer array <b>32</b> including a set of transducer elements that are rectangular in shape, and the transducer probe assembly generally has a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. Furthermore rotatable tip <b>34</b> connects to a distal segment of the catheter <b>10</b> with a rotatably smooth sliding contact. The rotatable tip <b>34</b> includes a backing material <b>36</b>. The rotatable tip <b>34</b> also includes a rounded tip portion <b>37</b> (atraumatic) to reduce the incidence of trauma to the human body as the tip <b>34</b> is fed into a patient. The rounded tip portion <b>37</b> is made from material such as a room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) elastomer or any silicone rubber. The transducer array <b>32</b> is isolated from bodily fluids by the same materials as utilized in the rounded tip portion <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The rotatable tip <b>34</b> is potentially rotatable by manual or motorized means. The rotatable tip <b>34</b> can be adapted to rotate in a variety of angular rotational ranges. For example, in one embodiment the tip <b>34</b> is rotated bidirectionally in a 360&#xb0; field of view. Alternatively the tip <b>34</b> rotation is restricted to rotate bidirectionally in a limited rotational range, e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise by 180&#xb0; in each direction. In a first embodiment, the rotating tip <b>34</b> is rotated by manipulation of the first in-line steering actuator <b>22</b> of the handle <b>18</b>, and is capable of approximately 180&#xb0; of rotation in the clockwise direction and 180&#xb0; rotation in the counter-clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> illustrate rotational steering affected by the actuator <b>22</b> of the catheter assembly <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the distal segment <b>14</b> in a central, neutral, or intermediate/relaxed position in between the two extremes of tip <b>34</b>'s rotation in relation to a distal segment termination <b>40</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. In order to rotationally steer the transducer array <b>32</b> to the rotated position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the first steering actuator <b>22</b>, a rotating knob, is turned in a first rotational direction with respect to the relatively fixed position of the handle <b>18</b>. The disclosed rotational steering mechanism facilitates smooth panning movement and pinpoint accuracy in imaging the desired tissue with the transducer array <b>32</b>. To rotate the catheter tip <b>34</b> in the opposite direction (e.g., counter-clockwise), the first steering actuator <b>22</b> (e.g., rotating knob) is moved in an opposing second rotational direction with respect to the handle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the illustrative embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the exemplary transducer array <b>32</b> is a linear array of 64 transducer elements that are individually controlled to fire and sense echoes in phases, but can alternatively be any number of transducer elements, for example 16, 32, 128 or 256. Alternatively the transducer array can be a curved array. In addition, the array can be a two-dimensional array, for example, two rows of 16 elements or four rows of 16 elements.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The transducer array illustrated in this embodiment is coupled to a single multiplexer chip <b>46</b> controlling the transmission/reception of signals to/from the array <b>32</b>. In an exemplary embodiment a multiplexer effectively reduces the number of wires passing through the majority of the length of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> by one half the transducer signal wires; for example, processing the signals received on 64 transducer elements with 32 electrical conduits instead of 64. In yet other exemplary multiplexers, further reduction is achieved by a factor of four, eight, or more. Whereas commercially-available intracardiac echocardiography catheter shafts are typically 8 French to 10 French in diameter, the multiplexing in the present system provides for a catheter shaft that is 6 French or smaller in diameter. This results in a less invasive procedure and less trauma to the patient. As a result of the smaller diameter of the catheter shaft of the present system, the size of the puncture in the access artery or vein (e.g., femoral vein, femoral artery, subclavian vein, jugular vein) is smaller, allowing for faster healing, fewer complications, more space for other catheters and an ability to perform procedures in smaller patients such as pediatric patients.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Though the single multiplexer chip <b>46</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>, more multiplexers can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, the (reduction) ratio between transducer elements and wires can be increased to further reduce the number of wires within the catheter shaft <b>12</b>, and thus reduce the catheter diameter. Alternatively, multiplexers are used to increase the number of transducer elements on an 8 F to 10 F catheter for greater than 64 transducer elements using 64 electrical wires. Each transducer directly connects to an electrical conductor/wire on a flex circuit before the multiplexer. For example a 256 element transducer array can be configured as a 1&#xd7;256 linear array, a 2&#xd7;128 1.5D array or alternatively as a 16&#xd7;16 array for 3D imaging. A catheter with an array configured for 3D or three-dimensional imaging has the ability to be used in 3D applications, for example to guide a &#x201c;smart&#x201d; ablation or other therapeutic procedure to a specific point or area in a 3D map. By placing in the tip <b>34</b> a tracking device such as a wire loop or RF antenna for determining, positioning, and tracking the position and orientation of the catheter tip, a three dimensional map or image of the entire area of study can be obtained. The coordinates of the catheter tip <b>34</b> are downloaded and combined with multiple &#x201c;slices&#x201d; or frames of ultrasound image data.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref> illustrate distal segment <b>14</b> flexing steering affected by the second actuator <b>24</b> in the first embodiment. The catheter <b>12</b> is flexed, using the actuator <b>24</b>, from a straight configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> into a flexed steering configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. In addition, the catheter <b>12</b>'s distal segment <b>14</b> is steerable into any number of flexed positions in between the straight configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> and the flexed configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, and can even be flexed beyond the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. The catheter is capable of flexing past the 90&#xb0; point in each direction and has an angular range of 0&#xb0; to 150&#xb0; from the straight or neutral configuration. The second direction is similar to what has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, and it can be appreciated that it is simply the mirror image of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrated for the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To affect flexing the distal segment <b>14</b> in the manner described above, the second steering actuator <b>24</b> (e.g., knob) is turned in a first rotational direction with respect to the relatively fixed position handle <b>18</b>. Rotating the actuator <b>24</b> in the first direction causes a first steering wire <b>56</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to apply tension to a steering bulkhead <b>38</b> forcing the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> to bend at bending joint <b>15</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>). In order to flex the catheter in the opposite direction, the second steering actuator <b>24</b> is turned in an opposing second rotational direction with respect to the handle <b>18</b>. This causes second steering wire <b>58</b> to apply tension to an opposite side of steering bulkhead <b>38</b>, forcing the catheter to bend in an opposite direction at the bending joint <b>15</b>. The catheter assembly <b>10</b>, by way of example, supports bidirectional flexed steering by at least 150 degrees in each direction from a neutral or straight catheter position. Using the combination of these two steering modes (rotational and flexing) is much more intuitive to the user than a steering mechanism based solely on either rotation or flexing&#x2014;but not both. In an example of a method for using the catheter assembly <b>10</b> having both rotational and flex steering, the catheter tip <b>34</b> is first placed into a desired location of the body, for example the right atrium of the heart. While visualizing the catheter tip position <b>34</b>, such as with ultrasound or fluoroscopy, the second steering actuator <b>24</b> is adjusted until the catheter orientation is close to the desired orientation. The first steering actuator <b>22</b> is then adjusted so that the rotatable tip <b>34</b> points the transducer array <b>32</b> in the desired orientation for the target image plane.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the rotatable catheter tip <b>34</b> in place in a right atrium <b>72</b> of the heart. Second steering actuator <b>24</b> has already been adjusted to orient the catheter tip <b>34</b> in the correct tip flex position. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the desired structure to be imaged, an atrial septum <b>74</b>, is not being imaged by ultrasound waves <b>76</b>. A heart wall <b>70</b> is instead being imaged. By manipulating first steering actuator <b>22</b>, the rotatable tip <b>34</b> is turned so that the ultrasound <b>76</b> impinges on the desired structure. This is done without torquing/twisting the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the adjustment of first steering actuator <b>22</b> is complete, and the rotatable tip <b>34</b> is now in position to image the atrial septum <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> and <b>18</b>-<b>21</b> illustrate detailed construction of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> of the first exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates the handle <b>18</b> with the catheter shaft <b>12</b> and the strain relief <b>26</b> removed to show a proximal orifice <b>138</b>. Cable wires <b>28</b> from the connector <b>30</b> extend through a proximal orifice <b>138</b>. The catheter steering mechanisms and signal wire bundle extend through distal orifice <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It can be seen that the contour of the handle facilitates one-hand use. The lower portion of the thumb and the two smallest fingers comfortably grip the handle <b>18</b> at a grip area <b>142</b>. The shape of the handle <b>18</b> and positioning of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> permits easy access for the thumb on the top of the handle and either the index or middle finger on the bottom of the handle to manipulate either the first steering actuator <b>22</b> or the second steering actuator <b>24</b> while maintaining hold on the grip area <b>142</b> of the handle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustratively depicts a top view of the handle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> to more clearly show the offset (staggered) alignment of the two actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with regard to a shared surface of the handle <b>18</b>'s housing <b>20</b>. With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a first lock lever <b>134</b> and a second lock lever <b>136</b> protrude slightly above the outer edges/diameters of the first steering actuator <b>22</b> and second steering actuator <b>24</b>. While in the resting locked position shown, the locking mechanisms controlled by the levers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> do not allow the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to be moved, thus maintaining the catheter <b>10</b> in its desired rotational and flex state. While a user's thumb manipulates one of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, the associated one of the lock levers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> is held down slightly by the thumb, releasing the corresponding locking mechanism and allowing the actuator to be moved (e.g., the knob rotates).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> that the contours of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and lock levers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are configured so that it takes a small amount of force to hold the lock levers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> down, and the thumb slides easily over the lock lever <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>'s surface while moving the corresponding actuator <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. After the actuator <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> is moved to the desired position and the thumb is taken off the lock lever <b>134</b> or <b>136</b>, the corresponding lock automatically engages the actuator <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>, holding the actuator <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> in the desired position until the next time it is to be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration for the locking mechanism on the actuator <b>22</b> (taken along section line <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), though other configurations such as a clutch (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 24A</figref> described herein below) are contemplated in alternative embodiments. The first lock lever <b>134</b> is attached at one end to the handle <b>18</b> and has a free floating lock lever end <b>158</b> at the other end. The first lock lever <b>134</b> has a flexible portion <b>148</b>, made, for example from a flexible polymer that is within its elastic limit over the flexible locked/unlocked displacement range used in the locking mechanism. Exemplary polymers include polycarbonate, acetal (such as Delrin&#xae; acetal resin), or any hard&#x2014;yet flexible&#x2014;plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the lock <b>134</b> in an unlocked position in the handle <b>18</b>. Note an upper thumb surface <b>150</b> and a lower finger surface <b>152</b>. The first lock lever <b>134</b> contains lock teeth <b>144</b>, which, when in the unlocked position, are not engaged with steering knob teeth <b>146</b>. In this position while the first lock lever <b>134</b> is held down and the flexible portion <b>148</b> is flexed, the first actuator <b>22</b> is turned to the desired orientation or angular position. When the first lock lever <b>134</b> is released, lock teeth <b>144</b> engage with steering knob teeth <b>146</b> and the first actuator <b>22</b> is locked in its angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Though the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> utilizes the engagement of teeth as an actuator locking mechanism, in an alternative embodiment the teeth locking mechanism is replaced by a friction surface on the lock that when engaged to a surface of the actuator (e.g. the wheel), the friction surface creates a holding force. The friction on the steering actuator's surface can be created by using a rough surface, or an elastomeric material like silicone, thermoplastic elastomers or rubbers, or a tacky material. In addition, though a radial engagement of the locking mechanism is shown, alternatively, the mechanisms as described can be incorporated in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 24A</figref>, the locking mechanism is provided by a clutch that includes a tensioning knob <b>192</b>, a friction cone <b>196</b> and the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The tensioning knob <b>192</b> generates a lateral displacement pushing the actuator <b>24</b> into further contact with the friction cone <b>196</b> resulting in a greater level of resistance to rotational motion. A similar cone (not shown) exerts resistance on the actuator <b>22</b>. The controllable additional resistance provides greater controllability to hold the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> against the restoring force presented by the steering lines that are in tension to maintain a desired position of the transducer probe mounted on the rotatable tip <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the rotatable tip <b>34</b>. The rotatable tip <b>34</b> has a length that typically is 10 mm, and ranges from 5 mm to 20 mm. The exemplary transducer array <b>32</b> includes 64 transducer elements <b>44</b> mounted on a backing material <b>36</b>. Inside the rotatable tip <b>34</b> is a stiffening member <b>42</b> proximate to the transducer elements <b>44</b>. The stiffening member <b>42</b> can be a tube or rod, or can be of noncircular cross-section. Stiffening member <b>42</b> is made, for example, from a stiff material, such as a metal. The stiffening member <b>42</b> is made, for example, of a radiopaque metal, such as platinum, though stainless steel of sufficient wall thickness is sufficiently radiopaque. Alternatively the transducer array <b>32</b> is large and stiff enough on its own, so that the stiffening member is not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The chip <b>46</b> is shown and provides for multiplexing, signal amplification or a combination of both as described earlier. A rotation point <b>51</b> represents the portion on the rotatable tip <b>34</b> that interfaces with the distal segment termination <b>40</b> on the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. The distal segment termination <b>40</b> is made, for example of engineered nylon (such as Pebax&#xae; polyether block amide). Attached to the rotatable tip in this embodiment is a torque member <b>50</b>, made of a torquable tube, for example a braided or coil reinforced tube. It can also be made from a co-extruded tube. This tube can also act as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. A cable bundle <b>48</b> is shown inside the torque member <b>50</b>. The cable bundle <b>48</b> can be coaxial or simple wire, etc. Each of the cables of the cable bundle <b>48</b> is terminated to electrical connections <b>49</b> interfacing with the integrated circuit chip <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> illustrate, when the first steering actuator <b>22</b> is moved, end piece <b>40</b>, steering bulkhead <b>38</b>, and catheter shaft <b>12</b> remain rotationally static, but torque member <b>50</b>, cable bundle <b>48</b>, and rotatable tip <b>34</b> all rotate together to the desired angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">To prevent blood from entering the central lumen <b>47</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>, a seal <b>45</b> such as an O-ring seal is placed at the rotation point <b>51</b> that allows the rotating components to rotate but serves as a barrier for blood to enter. In addition, a flexible sheath <b>41</b> connects and covers the tip <b>34</b> and distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>12</b> and provides for the tip <b>34</b> to rotate bidirectionally relative to the distal segment <b>14</b> by at least 360 degrees in each direction. In addition the sheath <b>41</b> provides a seal for the tip and distal segment of the catheter <b>12</b> from bodily fluids. The ends of the sheath <b>41</b> are thermally joined/fitted to the tip <b>34</b> and distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>12</b> to form a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a detailed internal view of the first embodiment of the catheter handle <b>18</b> for use with a catheter having a combination of rotational steering and flexed steering. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a gearing interface that enables the first actuator <b>22</b> to turn torque member <b>50</b>, which turns the cable bundle <b>48</b> and the rotatable tip <b>34</b>. The lock levers and top housing half of handle <b>18</b> are not shown in order to more clearly illustrate the gearing interface.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The first actuator <b>22</b> is rotated around a first shaft <b>182</b> causing actuator gear <b>164</b> to turn shaft gear <b>166</b>. Shaft gear <b>166</b> is attached to a stiff torque shaft <b>168</b>, which torque shaft is in turn attached to the torque member <b>50</b> in the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the torque member <b>50</b> is directly attached to shaft gear <b>166</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>, when the first actuator <b>22</b> is rotated in a first rotational direction <b>154</b>, the stiff torque shaft <b>168</b> is rotated clockwise. When the first actuator <b>22</b> is rotated in a second rotational direction <b>156</b>, the stiff torque shaft <b>168</b> is rotated counter-clockwise. Though a beveled gear pair is illustrated, alternatively other gearing mechanisms can be used, such as a worm and wheel combination.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cross section of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> over the majority of its length. The catheter shaft <b>12</b> includes central lumen <b>47</b> containing the wire bundle <b>48</b> including individual wires (e.g., <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b</i>) and a shared lumen <b>68</b> through which the first steering wire <b>56</b> and the second steering wire <b>58</b> pass. Each steering wire can alternatively be within its own sheath (not shown), and both assemblies of wire and sheath are contained within the shared lumen <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further distal, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the catheter shaft <b>12</b>'s configuration at steering bulkhead <b>38</b> includes a cross section having central lumen <b>47</b>, as well as first steering lumen <b>64</b> and second steering lumen <b>66</b>, through which the first steering wire <b>56</b> and the second steering wire <b>58</b> pass individually. In between the proximal and distal ends of the catheter <b>12</b> having exemplary cross sections illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 7</figref>, the assemblies of wire and sheath transition from the shared lumen <b>68</b> to the separate steering lumens <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the portion of the distal segment termination <b>40</b>, at which the distal ends of both of the steering wires <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are located. Steering wires are alternatively called steering lines. Attached or secured to the ends of the steering wires are a first end cap <b>60</b> and a second end cap <b>62</b>. As an alternative method to connect and attach or secure the steering wire to the distal segment of the catheter, a single steering wire turns around at the end piece <b>40</b>, secures to the distal ends of the steering lumens by tension and adhesive for example, and runs continuously and bidirectionally inside the catheter shaft <b>12</b> from a steering control actuator on the handle <b>18</b> without using end caps <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> to accomplish flexed steering. This configuration can be repeated to enable flexing in two or more directions. The end caps <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> or alternatively the continuous loop steering wire are attached to the distal segment termination <b>40</b> using adhesive, solder, welding, brazing, swaging, crimping, or other attachment methods. The steering wires <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are made, for example, of stainless steel or nitinol, but can also be made of aramid fiber (such as Kevlar&#xae; aramid fiber) or other high tensile types of line, and thus, the steering wires <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are more generally called steering lines to include a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials. A first clearance lumen <b>52</b> and a second clearance lumen <b>54</b> allow the end caps <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> to fit within them, but alternatively the clearance lumens <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can be formed permanently around the end caps. The diameter of each end cap <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> is larger than the diameter of each steering lumen <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">By pulling the first steering wire <b>56</b> in a proximal direction, the end cap <b>60</b> impinges on distal segment of the steering lumen <b>64</b> of the steering bulkhead <b>38</b>, causing this side of the catheter tubing to be stressed, thus causing the catheter shaft <b>12</b> to flex in a direction favoring this stress. Since steering wires <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are integrally connected and wrap around a steering knob, when the first steering wire <b>56</b> is pulled, the second steering wire <b>58</b> is extended on the other side of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>, resulting in a complimentary relaxation in the compliment wire and a smooth catheter profile for flexed steering. When second steering wire <b>58</b> is pulled instead of first steering wire <b>56</b>, the opposite occurs and the catheter shaft flexes in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the catheter shaft as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>-<b>8</b> the cable bundle <b>48</b> that includes wires <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>has a substantially uniform diameter and radial symmetry in the wire bundle <b>48</b>, such that the bending stiffness is substantially uniform in any plane or surface in flexed steering of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> in the present catheter assembly <b>10</b>. The cable bundle <b>48</b> is contained in free form tubing that is soft and compliant to enable the cable bundle to fit easily and symmetrically inside a lumen or cavity. For the operator of the present system this uniform bending stiffness enables easy and accurate control for improved manipulation or maneuverability to navigate and orient the transducers to an optimal position and orientation to image a target area in an intracardiac chamber such as an atrial chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In an alternative to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the shared lumen <b>68</b> is located more centrally in the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the steering lumens <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> pass through the central lumen <b>47</b> of the catheter <b>12</b>, and there is no shared lumen. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an exemplary arrangement is illustrated for flexed steering of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>'s distal segment <b>14</b>. Second steering actuator <b>24</b> is rotated around second shaft <b>184</b> causing first steering pulley <b>170</b> to rotate eccentrically and second steering pulley <b>172</b> to rotate concentrically. The knobs and steering pulleys rotate bidirectionally. First steering line <b>174</b> is wrapped around both pulleys <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> in a switch back or &#x201c;z&#x201d; configuration. One end of the steering line <b>174</b> terminates at an anchor spring <b>181</b> that secures to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The proximal end of first steering line <b>174</b> is secured inside the housing <b>20</b>, and is attached to an anchor spring <b>181</b> to maintain tension. As the second steering actuator <b>24</b> is turned, the effective length of the first steering line <b>174</b> is changed (i.e., increasing or decreasing) depending on the direction the knob is turned. Distally in the handle <b>18</b>, an upper distal pulley <b>160</b> and a lower distal pulley <b>162</b> help guide the steering line <b>174</b> as it extends into the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. A second steering line is a mirror image of the first steering line arrangement already described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the steering line <b>174</b> alternatively wraps around a steering pulley <b>172</b> and a cleat <b>173</b> or alternatively called a tie-off mechanism attached to the steering pulley <b>172</b> such that steering line <b>174</b> departs from the steering pulley <b>172</b> and returns to the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>12</b>. The cleat <b>173</b> provides for proper tension to be set and the reduction or elimination of slack in the steering line <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">An alternative embodiment of the catheter assembly is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> includes a torque cable <b>90</b> which allows the conductors, shown as a flat conductor assembly <b>92</b>, to be located outside the torque cable <b>90</b>, not inside a lumen. The torque cable <b>90</b> is made from multiple layer multifilar coils. The advantage to this configuration is that a cable of this type can be made to be very straight and thus have a better fine torque response than a torque tube configuration. In this embodiment, the flat conductor assembly <b>92</b> can be made from a flex circuit ribbon. The conductor assembly <b>92</b> and torque cable <b>90</b> have radial symmetry in the catheter shaft such that this configuration has the advantage of substantially uniform bending stiffness in any bending plane in flexed steering as already described. A surrounding tube <b>94</b> is made from shrink tubing, and holds the entire assembly together. Another advantage to this embodiment is that the torque cable <b>90</b> can extend further into the rotatable tip <b>34</b>, to secure it, and also allows for easier routing of the conductors at the tip <b>34</b> for electrical connection to the cable bundle <b>48</b>. Electrical connection can be achieved by micro-welding or soldering, or other known methods.</p>

In the transducer array <b>32</b> each transducer element can be independently programmed to fire. A substrate <b>82</b> is made, for example, from a thin and flexible material, such as polyimide. Some examples of polyimide are Kapton&#xae; polyimide or Upilex-S&#xae; polyimide. The substrate can also serve as an ultrasonic matching layer. Conductive tracings <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> create multiple conductors on the substrate <b>82</b> which is a part of the flex circuit. Each conductive tracing provides a single electrical conduit for each transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, transducer elements are attached to the flex circuit <b>77</b>.

One or more integrated circuit or chip <b>46</b> is connected to the conductive tracings <b>78</b> and <b>80</b>. In a specific configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the chip <b>46</b> is connected between the two groups of conductive tracings <b>78</b> and <b>80</b>.

A distal segment of the flex circuit is rolled over a stiffening member <b>42</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is proximate to and extends alongside the array of transducers. The backing material <b>36</b> is injected inside the rolled transducer assembly <b>84</b>. An additional matching layer can be formed over the assembly to provide better acoustic matching between the transducer piezoelectric material and the target tissue as well as the transmission medium. For example, RTV silicone is one such material that can be used. In one embodiment the D-shape cross section allows the linear layout of the transducer elements and uniform wall thickness of the matching layer due to the flat top for even and controlled focusing. The tip <b>34</b> has a proximal portion which has a rounded shape and encapsulates the proximal portion of the flex circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Exemplary transducers for ICE have a typical thickness of approximately 0.28 mm in the piezoelectric material to enable an 8 MHz ultrasound signal to be generated and transmitted at a typical velocity of 1500 m/sec through blood. The transducer thickness can be of various thicknesses ranging approximately from 0.56 mm to 0.19 mm to generate sufficient penetration depth in tissue imaging. In general, the thickness of the transducers can be adjusted for the frequency of sound in the transmission medium for the desired penetration depth in any tissue imaging. Image intensity can be adjusted by driving voltage on the transducers.</p>

First plane steering lines <b>119</b> and <b>121</b> and second plane steering lines <b>123</b> and <b>125</b> pass through four steering lumens in shaft <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an exemplary embodiment, a two-material shaft is provided to overcome stiffness of a high lubricity material. The shaft <b>129</b> is extruded so that each lumen has a lumen liner <b>127</b> consisting of a material that is different from the material of the shaft <b>129</b>. The material of the lumen liners is a high lubricity material that allows the steering lines to move axially with minimal frictional resistance. If the entire shaft were to be extruded from the material used in the lumen liners, the high stiffness of the lubricious material used would cause the shaft to be dangerously inflexible. By using an extrusion method that only incorporates this lubricious material into the lumen liners, the rest of the shaft can be made from a sufficiently flexible material to optimize catheter shaft flexibility, ease of use and safety in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an alternative tubing extrusion that includes embedded conductors <b>131</b> within the tubing wall and extending the length of the tubing. By packaging the conductors in this manner, the wall thickness of the tubing can be increased for strength. At the distal end of the tubing the conductors are well placed for making electrical terminations and further connections to the conductive tracings of the flex circuit. As shown, a flat ribbon of several conductors can be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, four groups of eight wire ribbons are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the handle <b>18</b> for use with the catheter embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>. Second steering actuator <b>24</b> works in the same manner as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Instead of the gearing mechanism in first steering actuator <b>22</b>, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> contains the same mechanism in both actuators for flexed steering in two different, orthogonal, planes or surfaces. One actuator operates the catheter flexing in a first plane and the other knob operates the catheter flexing in a second plane. First steering actuator <b>22</b> operates third steering pulley <b>178</b> and fourth steering pulley <b>180</b>, and its own steering lines (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a similar embodiment to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In place of the two smaller pulleys in each steering knob, each steering knob instead rotates first and second large pulleys <b>186</b> and <b>188</b>. For each plane, a single steering line is used from the distal end in one lumen, then proximally and around the large pulley, and then distally again, terminating at the distal end of the other lumen. The grooves of each pulley are coated with a low lubricity, high friction material, such as silicone elastomer, such that no slippage occurs on the steering line. Alternatively, the steering line is permanently attached to the pulley instead of being frictionally coupled. In this embodiment and all of the other embodiments using steering wire or steering line, tensioners (not shown) consisting of secondary pulleys spring loaded on an arm, can be used to minimize line slack.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a third embodiment of the present system a three-way steering catheter is made that combines the two orthogonally arranged flexed steering of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref> with the rotational steering associated with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-14</figref>. The three steering modes in this case, for example, are flexed steering left-to-right, flexed steering anterior-to-posterior, and tip rotation. An embodiment of the three plane steering catheter includes the configuration as already described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref> and adding a torque member connected to the rotating tip <b>14</b> on the distal side and to a third shaft gear assembly on the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>24</b>A and <b>26</b> illustrate a clutch mechanism facilitated by the interaction of the following components: a tensioning knob <b>192</b>, a cam <b>194</b> (or screw), actuator <b>24</b>, a thrust washer <b>186</b> and a friction cone <b>196</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). Actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> each are fit with friction cones (only friction cone <b>196</b> for actuator <b>24</b> is shown in the illustrative example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>). The thrust washer <b>186</b> acts as an interface between the cam <b>194</b> and the actuator <b>22</b>. Rotating the tensioning knob <b>192</b> in a first direction results in the application of lateral displacement to actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> which, in turn, increases the amount of contact area between the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and friction cones (e.g. cone <b>196</b> for actuator <b>24</b>). The increase in the contact area between the actuators and their corresponding friction cones results in increased resistance to rotational motion of the actuators&#x2014;which in turn results in increased resistance to the restoring force presented by the steering lines that are in tension. The clutch mechanism acts to create a slight and variable hold of a control actuator such as actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> such that an ideal position can be achieved by the clinician. By use of this variable resistance functionality the clinician can find the ideal position to do his procedure and increase the resistance to motion by further tightening the tensioning and thereby holding its set position. The resistance to movement functionality is achieved by three basic components: the friction cone <b>196</b> that is anchored to the handle <b>18</b>; actuators <b>22</b> and/or <b>24</b> that have surfaces which match the angle of the friction cones and are free to turn as well as move slightly axially onto and off of the friction cone <b>196</b>; and the cam <b>194</b> (or screw) that generates the side load and lateral motion of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> onto the friction cones such as cone <b>196</b>.</p>

In alternative embodiments, the tensioning knob <b>192</b> comprises a slider external control surface that provides a variable amount of resistance to movement of the actuators <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> by moving the slider within a sliding range along the side of the housing <b>20</b> of the handle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Having described a detailed example of a device suitable for using a multi-wire barrel connector, attention is directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> wherein an exemplary barrel connector <b>200</b> is illustratively depicted.

The flexible substrate is, by way of example, made of a polyimide having a thickness of 125 microns. The lead lines are made of gold, having a thickness of 75 microns. A manufacturer/provider of such flexible circuits is Dynamic Research Corporation (DRC Metrigraphics Division), 50 Concorde St., Wilmington, Mass.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the illustrative example, the male connector component <b>202</b> comprises a set of three separate piece parts that fit together to form a cylindrical shape that engages a female connector component <b>208</b>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a first instance, proper alignment of the male component <b>202</b>'s contacts and the female component <b>208</b>'s wire fingers is facilitated, in an illustrative embodiment, by a combination of a guide peg <b>240</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref><i>a</i>) and a corresponding channel/slot <b>226</b>. The peg <b>240</b> matches a side opening in the corresponding channel/slot <b>226</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. When the male component <b>202</b> is initially inserted, the channel/slot <b>226</b> guides the peg <b>240</b> to ensure that the wire fingers of the female component <b>208</b> are not damaged during insertion.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, a schematic diagram is provided of an exemplary locking mechanism incorporated into the female connector component <b>208</b> to ensure that the contact and wire finger connections are maintained after initially inserting and rotating the male connector component <b>202</b> in the female connector component <b>208</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, a rotation lock <b>250</b> is shown in an engaged position with a notch <b>252</b> within the flex circuit clamp <b>214</b>.

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In an exemplary embodiment, the rotation lock <b>250</b> snaps into a locking position within the notch <b>252</b> when the male connector component <b>202</b> has been sufficiently rotated within the female connector component <b>208</b> to create an electrical connection between the contacts of the flex circuit <b>206</b> and the wire fingers <b>238</b>. Thereafter, the rotation lock <b>250</b> is held in the depicted locking engagement position by a tensioning spring (not shown) or other resistive force.

After the male connector is inserted to a proper depth in the female connector <b>208</b>'s cavity, the connectors <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> are rotated about an eighth of a turn to affect electrical signal coupling between the finger wires <b>238</b> and contacts of the flexible circuit <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The aforementioned non-uniform radius for the substantially cylindrical male connector component <b>202</b> is provided in a variety of structures and their resulting cross-section outlines. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>, the non-uniform radius is provided by creating a flattened surface on a cylindrical male connector assembly's clamp components. In alternative embodiment the cross-sectional profile of the substantially cylindrical shaped male connector component exhibits a &#x201c;cam&#x201d; profile including a gradual cross-section radius change. Other non-uniform radius cross-sectional profiles for the male connector component, providing clearance for the wire fingers <b>238</b> when the male and female barrel connector components are initially engaged, are contemplated in alternative embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The male connector component is potentially formed in a variety of ways. Turning briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, an alternative male connector component <b>302</b> is depicted wherein each one of two flexible circuit supports <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> carries a flexible circuit (e.g., flexible circuit <b>308</b>). Furthermore, the flexible circuit support <b>306</b> depicts the channel/slot <b>326</b> corresponding to the channel/slot <b>226</b> in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. The flexible circuit support <b>306</b> also includes a notch <b>352</b> corresponding to the notch <b>252</b> in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. In yet another embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, a male connector component <b>402</b> is directly connected to a handle <b>400</b> of an ICE catheter assembly. Thus, it should be evident to those skilled in the art in view of the description of the following illustrative embodiments that there are a wide variety of structures that can be used to carry out the disclosed multi-wire barrel connector including multiple guides to ensure proper mating of the male and female connector components and prevent damage to fragile wires and leads.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is also within the scope of the disclosed exemplary embodiments to incorporate the improvements described into other types of ultrasound catheters, such as for example IVUS catheters. RF backscatter based tissue characterization is used in IVUS to determine plaque type (fibrous, fibro-lipidic, calcified, necrotic, etc.). This type of analysis is also known as Virtual Histology. Using this imaging technique with myocardial tissue instead of atherosclerotic plaque, different types of myocardial tissue can be identified, including for example, healthy myocardium, dead myocardium, or diseased myocardium. Also, ablated and non-ablated tissue can be identified, such as the tissue in the pulmonary veins or other cardiac tissue. RF backscatter tissue characterization can also be used to more correctly identify the extent of calcification on diseased heart valves.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An alternative steerable catheter utilizes a backbone of two-way shape memory. Current is selectively sent through different sections of a two-way shape memory metal lattice structure, causing phase change due to differential heating. For example, when current is sent through nodes on one side, the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> bends in a first direction. When current is turned off in nodes on the first side and turned on in nodes on a second side, the tip bends in a second direction, different from the first.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes magnetic rings. The catheter has one or more magnetic bands at the tip. When used in a laboratory equipped with a magnetic guidance system, such as that made by Stereotaxis, the distal segment <b>14</b> of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> can be made to flex in reaction to specific magnetic fields that are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes a micromotor. Instead of the rotatable tip being rotated in one direction or the other by turning a knob manually in the handle, a motor in the handle <b>18</b> rotates the assembly by pushing either a clockwise or counter-clockwise button. Alternatively, a micromotor is embedded in the tip and when a button in the handle is pressed, the micromotor rotates the rotatable tip.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Another alternative steerable catheter tip utilizes micromachines. An articulation or microgearing system is constructed in the distal end of the catheter using nanotechnology micro parts.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes spinning top articulation. The distal end of the catheter shaft <b>12</b> has two opposing spiral grooves in the wall. A rotatable tip is attached to a push rod, not a torque member. The rotatable tip has two tabs, one that slidably fits into each of the grooves. When the rod is pushed, the rotatable tip rotates to the right. When the rod is pulled, the rotatable tip rotates to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes spinning top articulation combined with piezo power. A piezoelectric material is used as a mount for a transducer array at the tip of the catheter shaft <b>12</b>. By activating the mount with a voltage, the mount oscillates a few degrees (for example 10 degrees), causing the transducer array to sweep back and forth, creating a 3D image.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes a superelastic material. Inside the catheter shaft <b>12</b> is a shaped mandrel of superelastic material which has a sliding stiff tube over it. When the stiff tube is pulled back, the superelastic mandrel takes its curved shape. When the stiff tube is advanced, the superelastic mandrel is straightened, causing the shaft to straighten with it. The distal end of the superelastic shaped mandrel is, by way of example, flattened.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Another alternative steerable catheter utilizes a hydraulic column. A polymeric catheter shaft is pre-shaped. It contains a lumen that is filled with a material such as a mineral or vegetable oil that is nontoxic and can be sterilized. A pistoning mandrel is slidable within the lumen. At the tip of the mandrel is a sealing stopper made from, for example, a ruby or ceramic ball for ultra low friction. As the mandrel is slid distally, the ball sealably slides within the lumen, increasing the pressure of the oil within the lumen and causing a curved tube to straighten, as in a Bourdon tube. Pulling on the mandrel lowers the pressure and allows the tubing to return to its shaped configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">It is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely illustrative of many potential applications of the disclosed device. Numerous modifications may be made to the improved ultrasound catheter that facilitates one-hand maneuvering of a steerable distal segment and tip of a catheter assembly without departing from the spirit and scope of the presently disclosed exemplary embodiments.</p>
