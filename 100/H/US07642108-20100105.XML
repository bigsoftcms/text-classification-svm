<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A photonic crystal light emitting diode (&#x201c;PXLED&#x201d;) is provided. The PXLED includes a periodic structure, such as a lattice of holes, formed in the semiconductor layers of an LED. The parameters of the periodic structure are such that the energy of the photons, emitted by the PXLED, lies close to a band edge of the band structure of the periodic structure. Metal electrode layers have a strong influence on the efficiency of the PXLEDs. Also, PXLEDs formed from GaN have a low surface recombination velocity and hence a high efficiency. The PXLEDs are formed with novel fabrication techniques, such as the epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique over a patterned masking layer, yielding semiconductor layers with low defect density. Inverting the PXLED to expose the pattern of the masking layer or using the Talbot effect to create an aligned second patterned masking layer allows the formation of PXLEDs with low defect density.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to light emitting diodes, more particularly to light emitting diodes with a photonic crystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Light emitting diodes (&#x201c;LEDs&#x201d;) are technologically and economically advantageous solid state light sources. LEDs are capable of reliably providing light with high brightness, hence in the past decades they have come to play a critical role in numerous applications, including flat-panel displays, traffic lights, and optical communications. An LED includes a forward biased p-n junction. When driven by a current, electrons and holes are injected into the junction region, where they recombine, releasing their energy by emitting photons. The quality of an LED can be characterized, for example, by its extraction efficiency that measures the intensity of the emitted light for a given number of photons generated within the LED chip. The extraction efficiency is limited, among others, by the emitted photons suffering multiple total internal reflections at the walls of the high refractive index semiconductor medium. As a result, the emitted photons do not escape into free space, leading to poor extraction efficiencies, typically less than 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the past thirty years, various approaches have been proposed to enhance the extraction efficiency of LEDs. The extraction efficiency can be increased, for example, by enlarging the spatial angle in which the emitted photons can escape by developing suitable geometries, including cubic, cylindrical, pyramidal, and dome like shapes. However, none of these geometries can entirely eliminate losses from total reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further source of loss is the reflection caused by the refractive index mismatch between the LED and the surrounding media. While such losses could be reduced with an anti-reflection coating, complete cancellation of reflection can be achieved only at a specific photon energy and one angle of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749, entitled &#x201c;Light Emitting Device Utilizing a Periodic Dielectric Structure,&#x201d; granted to J. Joannopoulos et al., describes an approach to the problem of enhancing the extraction efficiency. According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 a photonic crystal is created by forming a lattice of holes in the semiconductor layers of the light emitting diode. The lattice of holes creates a medium with a periodically modulated dielectric constant, affecting the way light propagates through the medium. The photons of the light emitting diode can be characterized by their spectrum or dispersion relation, describing the relation between the energy and the wavelength of the photons. The spectrum of a photonic crystal consists of two classes. Photons in the radiative class have energies and wavelengths that match the spectrum of photons in free space thus the radiative photons are capable of escaping from the light emitting diode. Photons in the guided class, on the other hand, have energies and wavelengths that do not match the spectrum of photons in free space; therefore, guided photons are trapped in the light emitting diode. The guided photons are analogous to the earlier described photons, suffering total internal reflections.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The spectrum of guided photons in the photonic crystal consists of energy bands, or photonic bands, separated by band gaps, in analogy with the spectrum of electrons in crystalline lattices. Guided photons with energies in the band gap cannot propagate in the photonic crystal. In contrast, the spectrum of the radiative photons is a continuum, and thus has no gap. The recombinative processes in a typical LED emit photons with a well-defined energy. If, therefore, a photonic crystal is formed in the LED such that the energy of the emitted photons falls within the band gap of the photonic crystal, then all the emitted photons are emitted as radiative photons as no guided photons can exist with such energies. As described above, since all the radiative photons are capable of escaping from the LED, this design increases the extraction efficiency of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an effort to explore the usefulness of photonic crystals for light generation, U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 gives a partial description of a theoretical structure of a photonic crystal device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 describes an n-doped layer, an active layer, and a p-doped layer, and a lattice of holes formed in these layers. However, the device of U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 is not operational and therefore is not a LED. First, electrodes are not described, even though those are needed for the successful operation of a photonic crystal LED (&#x201c;PXLED&#x201d;). The fabrication of electrodes in regular LEDs is known in the art. However, for PXLEDs, neither the fabrication of electrodes, nor their influence on the operation of the PXLED is obvious. For example, suitably aligning the mask of the electrode layer with the lattice of holes may require new fabrication techniques. Also, electrodes are typically thought to reduce the extraction efficiency as they reflect a portion of the emitted photons back into the LED, and absorb another portion of the emitted light.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 proposes fabricating photonic crystal light emitting devices from GaAs. GaAs is indeed a convenient and hence popular material to fabricate regular LEDs. However, it has a high &#x201c;surface recombination velocity&#x201d; of about 10<sup>6 </sup>cm/sec as described, for example, by S. Tiwari in &#x201c;Compound Semiconductor Devices Physics,&#x201d; Academic Press (1992). The surface recombination velocity expresses the rate of the recombination of electrons and holes on the surface of the diode. Electrons and holes are present in the junction region of the LED, coming from the n-doped layer and the p-doped layer, respectively. When electrons and holes recombine across the semiconductor gap, the recombination energy is emitted in the form of photons and generates light. However, when electrons and holes recombine through intermediate electronic states in the gap, then the recombination energy is emitted in the form of heat instead of photons, reducing the light emission efficiency of the LED. In an ideal crystal there are no states in the gap. Also, in today's high purity semiconductor crystals there are very few states in the gap in the bulk material. However, on the surface of semiconductors typically there are a large number of surface states and defect states, many of them in the gap. Therefore, a large fraction of electrons and holes that are close to the surface will recombine through these surface and defect states. This surface recombination generates heat instead of light, considerably reducing the efficiency of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This problem does not result in a serious loss of efficiency for regular LED structures. However, PXLEDs include a large number of holes, thus PXLEDs have a much larger surface area than the regular LEDs. Therefore, the surface recombination may be capable of reducing the efficiency of the PXLED below the efficiency of the same LED without the photonic crystal structure, making the formation of photonic crystal structure pointless. Since GaAs has a high surface recombination velocity, it is not a promising candidate for fabricating photonic crystal LEDs. The seriousness of the problem is reflected by the fact that so far, to Applicants' knowledge, no operating LED with a photonic crystal near the active region has been reported in the literature that uses GaAs and claims an enhanced extraction, or internal, efficiency. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 does not describe the successful operation of a photonic crystal LED. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,749 does not describe the influence of the photonic crystal on the emission process, which can affect the internal efficiency of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">While photonic crystals are promising for light extraction for the reasons described above, there are problems with the design. There are several publications describing experiments on a lattice of holes having been formed in a slab of a semiconductor. An enhancement of the extraction rate at photon energies in the bandgap has been reported by R. K. Lee et al. in &#x201c;Modified Spontaneous Emission From a Two-dimensional Photonic Bandgap Crystal Slab,&#x201d; in the Journal of the Optical Society of America B, vol. 17, page 1438 (2000). Lee et al. not only shows the extraction benefits of a photonic crystal in a light emitting design, but also shows that the photonic lattice can influence the spontaneous emission. However, Lee et al. do not show how to form and operate a light emitting device with this design. A photonic crystal LED can be formed from Lee et al.'s light emitting design by including electrodes. The addition of the electrodes, however, will substantially affect the extraction and the spontaneous emission. Since this effect is unknown, it cannot be disregarded in the design of a LED. Since the Lee et al. design does not include such electrodes, the overall characteristics of an LED, formed from that design, are unclear. This questions the usefulness of the design of Lee et al.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, there is a need for new designs to create operational photonic crystal LEDs. This need includes the introduction of new materials that have sufficiently low surface recombination velocities. The need also extends to designs that counteract predicted negative effects, such as reduced spontaneous emission rates and reflection by electrodes. Finally, there is a need for describing techniques for the fabrication of photonic crystal LEDs, including fabricating electrodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention a photonic crystal light emitting diode is provided. The PXLED includes an n-doped layer, a light emitting active layer, a p-doped layer, and electrodes for the n-doped and p-doped layers. A photonic crystal is formed as a periodic structure in the active layer, or in one of the doped layers, extending distances that are close to, or through, the active layer. In one embodiment the periodic structure is a two dimensional lattice of holes. The holes can have circular, square or hexagonal cross sections. The holes can be filled with air or with a dielectric. In another embodiment the periodic structure is periodic in only one dimension, an example of which is a set of parallel grooves. In another embodiment the dielectric constant of the PXLED can vary in one or two directions within the plane of the semiconductor layers. In another embodiment the thickness of the selected layers can vary in one or two directions within the plane of the semiconductor layers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The parameters characterizing the lattice of the holes, include the lattice constant, the diameter of the holes, the depth of the holes, and the dielectric constant of the dielectric in the holes. In some embodiments these parameters are chosen such that the wavelength of the emitted light lies close to the edge of the energy bands of the photonic crystal, because close to the band edge the density of states of the photons is large. The recombination energy can be emitted much more efficiently through photons with a large density of states. Therefore, in embodiments of the present invention that emit light with energies close to the band edge, the emitted power can exceed the power emitted by the same LED without the periodic structure up to about eight times. This enhancement can be related to the presence of metal electrode layers in embodiments of the invention that enhance the efficiency and increase the emitted power of the PXLEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present embodiments are formed from III-Nitride compounds, which include Nitrogen and a group III element, such as Gallium, Aluminum, or Indium. III-Nitride compounds are used because their surface recombination velocities are more than ten times smaller than that of GaAs, according to M. Boroditsky et al., in J. App. Phys. vol. 87, p. 3497 (2000). As described above, a low surface recombination velocity can increase the efficiency of a PXLED above the efficiency of a regular LED without the photonic crystal structure, making GaN PXLEDs technically and economically viable candidates for improved light generation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, GaN LEDs are the leading candidates for generating light in the blue and green regime of the spectrum; therefore, increasing their efficiency is highly desired. Finally, since the external quantum efficiency of GaN LEDs is often in the vicinity of 10 percent, the formation of photonic crystals can improve the efficiency of a GaN LED in a substantial manner. Here the external quantum efficiency is the product of the internal quantum efficiency and the extraction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The new structure of PXLEDs uses novel fabrication techniques. Some methods of the invention create a PXLED by forming an n-doped layer, an active layer overlying the n-doped layer, a p-doped layer overlying the active layer, and a p-electrode layer overlying the p-doped layer. In some embodiments, the n-doped layer, the active layer, and the p-doped layer can include one or more layers. Next, a patterned masking layer is formed with openings, overlying the p-doped layer. Through the openings of the masking layer the p-electrode layer and the underlying semiconductor layers are removed to form a lattice of holes with suitably chosen cross sections. Finally, the masking layer is removed, and an n-electrode layer is deposited on the n-doped layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some methods of the invention create a PXLED by forming a patterned masking layer with openings on a substrate. Then the epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique (&#x201c;ELOG&#x201d;) is used to form an n-doped layer overlying the masking layer, an active layer overlying the n-doped layer, a p-doped layer overlying the active layer, and a p-electrode layer on the p-doped layer. The ELOG technique creates semiconductor layers with a low density of defects, improving the performance and reliability of the PXLEDs. A second substrate is formed on the electrode layer and the first substrate is removed to expose the masking layer. Next, the semiconductor layers are at least partially removed through the openings of the masking layer to form a lattice of holes. Finally, the masking layer is used as the p-electrode layer, and an n-electrode layer is formed on the n-doped layer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some methods of the invention create a PXLED by forming a first masking layer on a substrate. Then the epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique is used to form an n-doped layer overlying the masking layer, an active layer overlying the n-doped layer, and a p-doped layer overlying the active layer. Next, the Talbot effect is used to form a second patterned masking layer overlying the p-doped layer, utilizing the diffraction of light across the openings of the first masking layer. Next, the semiconductor layers are at least partially removed through the openings of the first masking layer to form a lattice of holes. Finally, electrode layers are formed for both the n-doped layer and the p-doped layer.</p>

A first electrode layer <b>104</b> is formed from a thick and substantially reflective metal. In some embodiments first electrode layer <b>104</b> also serves as a substrate. In some embodiments first electrode layer <b>104</b> can overlie a substrate. Many different metals can be used for forming first electrode layer <b>104</b>, including Au, Al, Ag, and heavily doped semiconductors.

Finally, a second electrode layer <b>120</b> overlies p-doped layer <b>116</b>. Semiconductor layers <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>116</b> are often referred to as epi-layers <b>124</b>. Throughout the present application the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; can refer to either a single semiconductor layer or a multi-layer structure, where the individual layers of the multi-layer differ in dopant concentration, alloy composition, or some other physical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Active layer <b>112</b> includes the junction region where the electrons of n-doped layer <b>108</b> recombine with the holes of p-doped layer <b>116</b> and emit the energy of recombination in the form of photons.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The photonic crystal of the PXLED is created by forming a periodic structure in the LED.

While the efficiency indicators will be described in relation to a particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in analogous embodiments the efficiency indicators demonstrate analogous behavior. In this particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> epi-layers <b>124</b> are made from AlGaInN, with a suitably chosen alloying stoichiometry of the elements Al, Ga, In, and N. N-doped layer <b>108</b> is doped with silicon and p-doped layer <b>116</b> is doped with magnesium. N-doped layer <b>108</b> and p-doped layer <b>116</b> are designed for efficient carrier injection into active layer <b>112</b>. Active layer <b>112</b> includes InGaN layers, forming quantum wells, sandwiched between n-type InGaN layers with lower In concentration. The wavelength &#x3bb; of the emitted light can be tuned by suitably choosing the In concentration and thickness of the quantum wells. First and second electrode layers <b>104</b> and <b>120</b> are formed of highly reflective and low loss materials, including Ag, Al, and Au based electrode materials. The lattice is a triangular lattice as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The total thickness of epi-layers <b>124</b> are between 0.375 a and 2 a and the hole diameter d is 0.72 a. The first electrode <b>104</b> has a thickness of a, or greater, and the second electrode <b>120</b> has a thickness of 0.03 a. The location of the active layer <b>112</b> is 0.0625 a away from the center of epi-layers <b>124</b>, closer to first electrode layer <b>104</b>. The efficiency of PXLED <b>100</b> is sensitive to the location of active layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates two indicators of the efficiency of the above particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The solid line indicates the relative emission, while the dashed line indicates the extraction efficiency. The relative emission is defined as the ratio of the total power emitted in the form of light by an LED with a photonic crystal structure, divided by the total power emitted by the same LED, but without the periodic structure. The efficiency indicators are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as a function of the photon frequency v, normalized by c/a, wherein c is the speed of light&#x2014;in air&#x2014;and a is the lattice spacing. The photon frequency v and the photon energy E are related through the well-known relation: E=hv, where h is Planck's constant. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the relative emission shows a maximum in the vicinity of the value v/(c/a)=0.70. The relative emission of PXLED <b>100</b> is approximately eight times larger at the maximum compared to the relative emission of the same LED, but without the photonic crystal structure. The extraction efficiency of PXLED <b>100</b> is relatively flat as a function of the frequency. The total efficiency of PXLED <b>100</b> is proportional to the product of these quantities, clearly showing that forming a photonic crystal in an LED enhances the total efficiency and thus the emitted power, if the parameters of PXLED <b>100</b> are chosen suitably.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment the lattice is designed so that a maximum of the relative emission, and thus the total efficiency, occurs at or near the frequency of the emitted light. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the maximum of the relative emission occurs around the frequency of v=0.7(c/a). Therefore, in a PXLED where the active layer emits light with wavelength &#x3bb;, a local maximum of the relative emission will substantially coincide with the frequency of the emitted light, if the lattice spacing of the photonic crystal a is about 0.7&#x3bb;. Here the relation &#x3bb;v=c has been used to connect the wavelength &#x3bb; and the frequency v. For example, if the wavelength of the emitted light &#x3bb; is 530 nm, then the lattice spacing a is 371 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The analysis of the band structure and the corresponding density of states reveal that the above enhancement of the power occurs at energies close to the band edge. The density of the photons is large close to the band edge. The rate of spontaneous emission is proportional to the density of states. Thus, a large density of states enhances the rate of spontaneous emission. Therefore, embodiments are designed so that the energy of the emitted light lies close to the band edge, thus enhancing the efficiency of the PXLED. Furthermore, the PXLED parameters a, d, w, and &#x3bb;<sub>h</sub>, and the design of the electrode layers can be selected to enhance the extraction efficiency as well, maximizing the total efficiency of the PXLED. The efficiency of the PXLED shows significant sensitivity to the presence and design of the electrode layers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other embodiments typical values of the lattice spacing a lie between about 0.1&#x3bb; and about 10&#x3bb;, preferably between about 0.1&#x3bb; and about 4&#x3bb;. Typical values for the hole diameter d lie between about 0.1 a and about 0.5 a. Typical values of the depth of the hole w lie between zero and the full thickness of epi-layers <b>124</b>. Finally, &#x2208;<sub>h </sub>typically lies between 1 and about 16.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In embodiments, where epi-layers <b>124</b> have a total thickness of about 2 a or higher, the maximum value of the relative emission is 2-3 fold smaller. In these embodiments the maximum value is less sensitive to the presence or absence of electrode layers <b>104</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments, where the electrode layers have substantial dissipative properties, such as a substantial imaginary part of the refractive index n, the design parameters may differ considerably from the above-described values. The efficiency of the emission depends on the polarization of the emitted light. However, PXLEDs with a honeycomb lattice of holes are capable of emitting light with an emission efficiency that is polarization insensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the two indicators of the efficiency of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. While the efficiency indicators will be described in relation to a particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in analogous embodiments the efficiency indicators demonstrate analogous behavior. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, epi-layers <b>124</b> are only partially removed in holes <b>122</b>-<i>i</i>. The depth of holes <b>122</b>-<i>i </i>is 2 a in this particular embodiment. In this particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the total thickness of epi-layers <b>124</b> is greater than about 2 a, for example 6 a. The air-filled holes have a diameter d of about 0.72 a, and the depth of the holes is about 2 a. Similar results hold for hole diameters lying in the range of about 0.3 a and about a. Second electrode layer <b>120</b> has a thickness of about 0.09 a, and active layer <b>112</b> is formed with a thickness of about 0.5 a.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates two indicators of the efficiency of the above particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Again, the solid line indicates the relative emission, while the dashed line indicates the extraction efficiency. In analogy with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the relative emission shows an enhancement with a maximum of about 2.7 at a frequency of about v=0.325(c/a). Furthermore, in this embodiment the extraction rate also varies as a function of the frequency, unlike in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In particular, the extraction rate exhibits broad maxima in the 0.3(c/a) to 0.45(c/a) range, and around 0.65(c/a).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the product of the extraction efficiency and the relative emission, the two quantities shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. As mentioned before, the total efficiency of the PXLED is proportional to this product. As demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the emitted power of this embodiment is once again greater than that of the corresponding LED without the photonic crystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the total efficiency shows maxima at the normalized frequencies of about v=0.325(c/a) and about v=0.63(c/a). Therefore, in a PXLED where the active layer emits light with wavelength A, local maxima of the relative emission will substantially coincide with the frequency of the emitted light, if the lattice spacing of the photonic crystal a is about a=0.325&#x3bb; or about a=0.63&#x3bb;. Here again the relation &#x3bb;v=c has been used to connect the wavelength &#x3bb; and the frequency v. For example if the emitted wavelength &#x3bb; is 530 nm then the lattice spacing a can be suitably chosen to be about 172 nm or about 334 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some embodiments show a resonant behavior at some frequencies. At these resonant frequencies the pattern of emission can be different from the emission at other frequencies. For example, in the vicinity of the frequency v/(c/a)=0.54 the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> radiates its power mostly towards the second electrode layer instead of the first electrode layer, resulting in a minimum of the extraction efficiency. The existence of this minimum once again underscores the importance of the electrode layers. This effect can be used to design PXLEDs that emit a large fraction of the generated light into a selected direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In embodiments, where the electrode layers <b>104</b> and <b>120</b> have substantial dissipative properties, such as a substantial imaginary part of the refractive index n, the design parameters may differ considerably from the above-described values.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The periodic structure can be made three-dimensional by creating a variation of the dielectric constant of one or more selected semiconductor layers in the direction normal to the plane of the layers besides the already formed two-dimensional periodic structure. This can be achieved, for example, by forming several structural layers within a selected semiconductor layer, the structural layers having two different alloy compositions in an alternating manner.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments the periodic structure is a variation of the thickness of one or more selected semiconductor layers. The periodic structure can include variations of the thickness along one direction within the plane of the semiconductor layers, but extending along a second direction without variation, in essence forming a set of parallel grooves. Two-dimensional periodic variations of the thickness include various lattices of indentations.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">While the present embodiment and further embodiments below are described having an n-doped layer deposited first and a p-doped layer formed overlying the n-doped layer, LEDs with the opposite architecture, where a p-doped layer is deposited first and an n-doped layer is formed overlying the p-doped layer, are also understood to be within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As explained above, semiconductors with low surface recombination velocities are promising candidates for forming PXLEDs. Electrons and holes recombining on the surface via mid-gap states release their energy in the form of heat instead of light. Therefore, the surface acts as a current sink, reducing the efficiency of PXLEDs. The reduction of efficiency is high in PXLEDS formed from semiconductors with high surface recombination velocities, such as GaAs. In fact, the efficiency of GaAs PXLEDs can be reduced below the efficiency of GaAs LEDs with the same architecture, but without the photonic crystal structure. For this reason, fabricating PXLEDs from GaAs does not offer significant advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In contrast, forming a photonic crystal structure in GaN LEDs can significantly increase the efficiency of the GaN LEDs, because GaN has a much lower surface recombination velocity than GaAs.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Therefore, in embodiments of the present invention epi-layers <b>124</b> are formed from semiconductors with low surface recombination velocities. Suitable choices include III-Nitride semiconductors, formed from Nitrogen and a group III element, such as Gallium. The advantages of this choice can be appreciated by noting that the surface recombination velocity of GaAs is about 10<sup>6 </sup>cm/sec, whereas the surface recombination velocity of GaN is about 3&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cm/sec. The low surface recombination velocity makes the surface recombination process much weaker in GaN than in GaAs. Furthermore, the diffusion length of carriers in GaN is also much smaller than in GaAs. Therefore, much fewer carriers diffuse onto to the surface in GaN than in GaAs during traversing the LED. The smallness of the number of carriers, reaching the surface by diffusion, further weakens the already weak surface recombination process.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">III-Nitride LEDs can also be formed using AlGaN, InGaN or combinations thereof.</p>

GaN semiconductors have an unusually large concentration of defects, including fractures and dislocations.

Therefore, the defect concentration will be high in defect-rich regions <b>134</b>-<i>i </i>directly above lattice of openings <b>130</b>-<i>i</i>, whereas the defect concentration will be low in defect-poor regions <b>138</b>-<i>i</i>, between lattice of openings <b>130</b>-<i>i. </i></p>
