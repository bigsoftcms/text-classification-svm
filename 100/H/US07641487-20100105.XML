<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to PCT application PCT/GB2006/001009, filed Mar. 21, 2006, which claimed priority to United Kingdom Patent Application No. 0508382.9, filed Apr. 26, 2005.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cable connection device for operatively connecting two sections of cable and an underwater system including such a device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Underwater facilities, for example subsea hydrocarbon wells, are conventionally controlled via a long umbilical cable extending between the facility and a surface base. The umbilical cable may be used to supply both electrical and hydraulic control signals to the well. However, there are occasions when the umbilical cable fails. Under these circumstances, a back-up system to temporarily restore power and control to the well complex is employed. There are a variety of systems that subsea fluid extraction equipment suppliers have produced with variable success. They are mainly designed to be operated from a vessel of opportunity carrying a drum loaded with an umbilical cable, which is deployed by a crane/winch, typically from the stern of the vessel and a local source of electric and hydraulic power along with a well complex control system. This power and control system is typically mounted on a skip which can then be easily fitted and removed from the vessel of opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical deployed back-up intervention system, the profile of the deployed umbilical cable to the well is important as the system has to survive the movement of the vessel in severe weather conditions and cope, typically, with peak wave conditions resulting in the heave at the vessel stern as high as 21 meters. To establish the correct profile the umbilical cable is fitted with collars in suitable positions along the length of the umbilical cable and this buoyancy system is designed to allow the collars to be part of the umbilical cable when it is wound on the drum. This avoids having to fit them to the umbilical cable when it is deployed, and thus making the deployment process much more rapid. Furthermore, since the dead-weight of an umbilical cable can be typically 43 tons, the collars make a contribution to reducing the effective weight seen by the vessel stern. Thus the collars are designed to have &#x2018;neutral buoyancy&#x2019; when they are deployed along with the effective umbilical cable weight, i.e. after subtraction of the &#x2018;buoyancy&#x2019; due to water displacement of the umbilical cable itself. The umbilical cable is fitted with a connector at the subsea end, designed to be mated at the well complex, by a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). A further connector is required, inserted in the umbilical cable, close to the vessel, to allow quick disconnection in an emergency, such as peak waves exceeding the design limits, or snagging of the umbilical cable. It is this aspect of the existing back-up intervention equipment which has been the least successful since they have been prone to either disconnect when not required to do so or, equally disastrously, fail to disconnect when required. This is mainly due to inadequate consideration of the forces involved, not only due to the load of the umbilical cable trying to part the connection, but the forces required to part the connector in an emergency when operating at sea temperatures as low as minus eighteen degrees centigrade, which can result in ice locking the connector halves together.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an aim of the present invention to overcome these problems by the introduction, in the umbilical cable, of a novel connection device or &#x201c;Emergency Quick Disconnect Package&#x201d; (EQDP) which takes such forces into consideration and will thus function reliably under severe sea states and low temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The interface of an EQDP consists of two mating stab plate halves, each carrying a multiplicity of mating connectors carrying hydraulic and electric power and control signals, which must separate when required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus the primary requirements of an EQDP are:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">A) The stab plate halves must not inadvertently release.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">B) It must react to all loads and moments coming into it from the umbilical cable without any separation.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0010">C) The emergency parting of the stab plate halves must be guaranteed and in all environmental conditions, e.g. temperature, icing, sea state, and water depth.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0011">D) It must remain fully functional in all the above environmental conditions.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0012">E) It must connect all power and control functions between the vessel mounted power and control system and a dynamic umbilical cable.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0013">F) After emergency quick disconnection (EQD), the dropped half must survive in the sea until recovered.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0014">G) Release is to be effected within a defined radius circle, typically 95 m.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">The present invention meets these requirements by utilising a positive lock between the stab plate halves and by employing at least two independent methods of release.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">Prior art methods of securing and emergency releasing, of the two halves of an EQDP are notoriously unreliable. They are well known to part when not necessary, since the method as securing the two halves of an EQDP have been a compromise between separation, when essential, to protect the umbilical cable, and securing under weather conditions which, although severe, are workable. Thus existing mechanisms do not employ positive locking between the EQDP halves, i.e. they typically use a &#x2018;spring clip&#x2019; type of engagement. The result is frustration and substantial recovery costs for the back-up intervention operator. This invention not only overcomes the lack of positive locking but at the same time still provides a fully controllable quick release. Furthermore it may also provide a 100% back-up in the event of failure of the normally used quick release mechanism, and neither of these release methods compromise the positive locking.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cable connection device for operatively connecting two sections of cable, the device comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">first and second parts for respective connection to the first and second cable sections, said first and second parts having mutually engageable components for releasably locking the two parts together; and</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">a release mechanism which when activated permits the first and second parts to separate, said mechanism comprising means for forcibly separating the first and second parts.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">The engagement and disengagement of the components may be manually controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">The engageable components preferably comprise male and female members respectively. The distance between the members may be adjustable. The members may be configured such that the members are relatively rotatable between first and second positions, and wherein engagement of the members is only possible substantially at said first position. The members when engaged may be locked by rotation toward said second position. The female member may be releasably attached to one of the parts.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022">Preferably, the release mechanism when activated permits the separation of the first and second parts without disengagement of the engageable components. The release mechanism when activated may detach the female member from its respective part. This detachment may be hydraulically controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0023">Advantageously, the means for forcibly separating the first and second components comprises hydraulic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0024">Preferably, a second release mechanism is provided, comprising additional means for forcibly separating the first and second parts. This second release mechanism when activated may force relative rotation of the members to permit their disengagement. The additional means for forcibly separating the first and second components may comprise hydraulic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025">Advantageously, the device is suitable for use underwater.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026">Advantageously, the cable sections carry at least one of hydraulic and electric lines.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an underwater system comprising a cable for carrying electric and/or hydraulic signals, the cable including a connection device for connecting two sections of the cable, wherein the connection device comprises two parts, each for connection to a respective section, such that in normal operation the two parts are locked together, the device further comprising means for forcibly separating the parts.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the function of an EQDP with an arrangement of a vessel of opportunity <b>1</b>, with a drum <b>2</b>, that carried an umbilical cable <b>3</b>, prior to its deployment. The umbilical cable <b>3</b> feeds back-up hydraulic, electric and control supplies to the well complex <b>4</b>, on the seabed <b>5</b>. The profile of the umbilical cable <b>3</b> is maintained by the flotation collars <b>6</b>. The EQDP <b>7</b> is located close to the vessel. To aid recovery of the lower half of the EQDP after an emergency disconnect, further collars <b>8</b> are typically fitted to the umbilical cable below it, so that it does not sink to the seabed, where its recovery would be much more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates diagrammatically a sectioned view of an EQDP in accordance with the present invention. The EQDP is shown in the &#x2018;locked together&#x2019; position and consists of an upper half part <b>9</b> and a lower half part <b>10</b>. The interface between them is formed by stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, which permit electrical and/or hydraulic connection between the umbilical cable sections on each side of the EQDP. A flexible seal <b>13</b> is provided between the two parts <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. The mechanism that clamps and releases the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> consists of a shaft <b>14</b>, with a male cruciform end <b>15</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This matches a female cruciform in an anchor plate <b>16</b>, which is secured to the lower stab plate <b>12</b> by the pins <b>17</b>, in a proprietary, hydraulically-operated, dog-latch <b>18</b>. The dog-latch <b>18</b> is operated by a hydraulic ram <b>19</b>. The shaft <b>14</b> is part threaded, on to which a threaded flanged tube <b>20</b> is screwed. The tube <b>20</b> is secured to the upper stab plate <b>11</b> by a flanged collar <b>21</b>, such that it is able to rotate but not move axially vertically. The tube <b>20</b> is attached to a gearbox <b>22</b>, for example of worm and pinion type, not shown sectioned, attached to a support plate <b>23</b>. This is manually operable by a handwheel <b>24</b>. A cam tube <b>25</b> is also secured to the shaft <b>14</b> by means of a shear pin <b>26</b>. The upper face of this cam tube <b>25</b> is machined at a shallow angle (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and mates against a matching angled face, machined in a collar <b>27</b> which is attached to the stab plate <b>11</b>. Built-in stops in the collar <b>27</b> limit the rotation of the cam tube <b>25</b> to about forty-five degrees. The shaft <b>14</b> is fitted with a &#x2018;back stop nut&#x2019; <b>28</b> and is also splined to the output shaft of an axial to rotary hydraulic actuator <b>29</b>, not shown sectioned, that allows axial movement of the shaft <b>14</b>. The hydraulic actuator <b>29</b> is mounted on a back plate <b>30</b> of the upper half <b>9</b> of the EQDP. Four hydraulic rams <b>31</b>, not shown sectioned, are mounted symmetrically around the stab plate <b>12</b>, only two of which are visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Two diametrically opposite hydraulic rams <b>31</b> and the hydraulic dog latch <b>18</b> are all fed with a single hydraulic feed. This is fed via a hydraulic connector between the EQDP halves, not shown, and powered via the umbilical to the vessel from a hydraulic pressure source, typically housed in a skip, mounted on the vessel, i.e. the &#x201c;primary release&#x201d; hydraulic power source. The other two hydraulic rams <b>31</b> and the hydraulic actuator <b>29</b> are all fed from a separate hydraulic power source, via a separate feed through the umbilical cable to the vessel, i.e. the &#x201c;secondary release&#x201d; hydraulic power source, typically mounted in the same skip as the primary hydraulic source. This arrangement provides a back-up release system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">Although the purpose of an EQDP, in normal operation, is to mate a multiplicity of connectors, mounted on the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, to transmit hydraulic fluid, electric power and control signals, between the two halves of the EQDP <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, they have not been shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for clarity, since they do not substantially affect the engagement or release functions of the inventive connection device. Likewise the umbilical cable feeding to and from the EQDP is also not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">The operation of the positive latching of the two halves of the EQDP is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">When the two halves of the EQDP <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are first brought together, the cruciform end of the shaft <b>14</b> protrudes from the stab plate <b>11</b>. The cruciform <b>15</b> aligns with the female cruciform in the anchor plate <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, such that as the two halves are mated the male cruciform passes through the female cruciform in the anchor plate <b>18</b>. The hand wheel <b>24</b> is rotated so that, through the gearbox <b>22</b>, the threaded tube <b>20</b> rotates. Since this tube <b>20</b> is constrained from axial movement by its flange and the collar <b>21</b>, the shaft <b>14</b> moves axially, i.e. vertically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with the hand wheel rotated in the appropriate direction. Lifting of the shaft <b>14</b> engages the cam tube <b>25</b> with the collar <b>27</b> and due to the angled faces of both, forces the shaft <b>14</b> and its cruciform end <b>15</b> to rotate out of alignment with the female cruciform in the anchor plate <b>16</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, whilst with continued rotation to draw together the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and compressing the flexible seat <b>13</b>. The high mechanical advantage of the gearbox <b>22</b> easily permits a tight clamping by hand without the need for tools. A sketched view of the cam tube <b>25</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The rotation of the shaft <b>14</b> and its cruciform end <b>15</b> is limited to 45 degrees by the end stops built into the collar <b>25</b>. The process results in the positive clamping together of the two halves of the EQDP.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">To separate the two EQDP halves, the hand wheel <b>24</b> is rotated in the reverse direction so that the tube <b>20</b> rotates and drives the shaft <b>14</b> downwards, until the back stop nut <b>28</b> engages with the end of the tube <b>20</b>. Further rotation of the hand wheel <b>24</b> then forces the shaft <b>14</b> to rotate, but it is limited to about forty-five degrees by the cam tube <b>25</b> and collar <b>27</b> assembly design, thus aligning the cruciform <b>15</b> with the female cruciform in the anchor plate <b>16</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and allowing separation of the EQDP halves <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. Since this release mechanism is hand-operated it has no involvement in any emergency release and is used for deployment and recovery only.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">The operation of the primary Emergency Quick Release mechanism is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">When an emergency quick disconnect is required, the primary release hydraulic supply from the skip on the vessel, feeding the hydraulic actuator <b>19</b> and two of the rams <b>31</b>, is energised. This releases the dog-latch <b>18</b> allowing the anchor plate <b>16</b> to detach from the stab plate <b>12</b>, whilst the two hydraulic rams <b>31</b> push the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> apart. Thus the two halves of the EQDP are separated, with the anchor plate still attached to the shaft <b>14</b> and cruciform <b>15</b>. The EQDP lower half can then be recovered and the EQDP easily re-assembled when conditions permit. Although the weight of the umbilical cable between the flotation collars <b>8</b> and the EQDP <b>7</b> is normally sufficient to part the EQDP, in the case of low temperatures where icing may prevent this occurring, the two hydraulic rams <b>31</b> ensure that parting of the EQDP halves is rapidly achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">The operation of the secondary Emergency Quick Release mechanism is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">If, for any reason, the primary quick release mechanism fails, the secondary or back-up mechanism is operated. In this case, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the secondary hydraulic feed to the axial to rotary hydraulic actuator <b>29</b>, which also feeds the second pair of hydraulic rams <b>31</b>, is energised. The actuator <b>29</b> is coupled to the shaft <b>14</b> such that when the hydraulic supply is energised, the actuator <b>29</b> endeavours to forcefully further rotate the shaft <b>14</b> in the locking direction. However the rotation of the shaft <b>14</b> has been previously limited to about forty-five degrees by the cam tube <b>25</b> and the collar <b>27</b>. The relatively high torque of the hydraulic actuator <b>29</b> results in the shearing of the shear pin <b>26</b>, thus permitting the shaft <b>14</b> to further rotate by about forty-five degrees. At the same time, the second pair of hydraulic rams <b>31</b> are endeavouring to part the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. When the male cruciform <b>15</b>, on the end of the shaft <b>14</b>, becomes aligned with the female cruciform in the anchor plate <b>26</b>, it slips through the anchor plate, assisted by the force of the rams <b>31</b>, allowing the parting of the stab plates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and thus release of the two halves <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> of the EQDP. Again, any icing at low temperatures is overcome by the hydraulic rams <b>31</b>. Tests on a prototype assembly have shown that the secondary release mechanism takes less than two seconds to complete its release cycle. When the lower half of the EQDP is recovered it cannot be rapidly re-assembled to the upper half, following use of this back-up release system, since the shear pin <b>26</b> has to be replaced first. However, since this pin is located in the upper half of the EQDP, which is still attached via the short section of umbilical to the vessel, it is easily recovered, allowing its relatively straightforward replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">It should be noted that the above description describes an exemplary embodiment only. Other alternatives will be obvious to those skilled in the art within the scope of the claims. For example, the shaft <b>14</b> need not have a cruciform end, but any shape, apart from circular, may be used.</p>
