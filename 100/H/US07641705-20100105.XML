<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electrochemical cell including a cell enclosure, a fill tube, a ball, a closing button, an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The cell enclosure defines an internal volume and includes a cover forming a fillport through hole. The fill tube is separately formed, and defines a leading section, a trailing section, and a passageway. The leading section is secured within the fillport through hole. The ball is sealingly secured within the passageway. The closing button is also separately formed, and is sealingly secured within the fillport through hole adjacent the leading section of the fill tube. The anode, cathode, and electrolyte are maintained within the internal volume. By configuring the fill tube such that the leading section thereof is secured within the fillport through hole, an overall extension of the fill tube relative to the internal volume is greatly reduced, thereby maximizing a volumetric efficiency.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electrochemical cell intended for powering implantable medical devices. More particularly, it relates to a liquid electrolyte-type electrochemical cell having a reduced height fillport sealing design.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of different implantable medical devices (IMD) include one or more self-contained power sources that power the various components of the IMD. For example, implantable, programmable drug delivery devices (e.g., used to treat pain, spasticity, and cancer), IMDs useful for therapeutic stimulation of the heart, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, pacemakers, etc., typically incorporate one or more power sources. Numerous other battery-powered implantable medical devices are further available.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regardless of the exact construction and application, suitable power sources or batteries for IMD's are virtually always electrochemical in nature, commonly referred to as an electrochemical cell. Acceptable electrochemical cells for IMDs typically include a cell enclosure or encasement maintaining various components including an anode, a separator, a cathode, and an electrolyte, and are well known in the art. In general terms, the anode material is typically a lithium metal, or, for rechargeable cells, a lithium ion-containing body. Lithium batteries are generally regarded as acceptable power sources due in part to their high energy density and low self-discharge characteristics relative to other types of batteries. The cathode material is typically metal-based, such as silver vanadium oxide (SVO), manganese dioxide, etc. The electrolyte can also assume a variety of forms such as propylene carbonate containing a dissolved salt such as lithium perchlorate, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As previously described, the various components of the electrochemical cell are maintained within a cell enclosure. Depending upon the particular performance requirements of the electrochemical cell, construction of the anode, or cathode, or other components within the cell enclosure itself can vary. The electrolyte, however, is typically in liquid form, and thus must be dispensed or &#x201c;charged&#x201d; into the cell enclosure. As such, the cell enclosure itself is typically comprised of separate case and cover components, with the cover forming a fillport through which the electrolyte can be dispensed. Once a desired volume of electrolyte has been dispensed into the cell enclosure, the fillport is then sealed. In light of the intended bodily implant end-use, it is imperative that a complete, hermetic seal be formed that prevents passage of the electrolyte outwardly from the cell enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various fillport sealing designs have been suggested for achieving a requisite hermetic seal. One accepted technique is to weld a separate cap or similar structure over the fillport following electrolyte charging, thereby sealing the fillport opening. Unfortunately, this welding operation may conduct heat to the electrolyte, potentially leading to some electrolyte evaporation. The evaporated electrolyte, in turn, may escape into the weld zone, possibly negatively affecting an integrity of the resulting weld (e.g., pin holes, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of the above weld seal integrity concerns, various other fillport designs have been implemented, whereby a primary seal and a secondary seal are created. In particular, a non-welded, secondary seal is initially formed, followed by a more conventional welded primary seal. With this technique, the secondary seal prevents evaporated electrolyte gases from escaping, and thus from negatively affecting the subsequent weld-type seal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prevailing technique for establishing the secondary seal is to press-fit an insert piece within the fillport opening itself or within some other component that is otherwise fluidly connected to the fillport opening. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,913,986 describes an electrochemical cell having a metal sleeve welded to (and extending outwardly from) the fillport opening in the cover. Following electrolyte dispensement, a plug is press-fitted or interference-fitted into the fillport opening, thereby establishing a secondary seal. Subsequently, a top of the sleeve is hermetically sealed by welding a metal cap in place. Other references, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,632 to Honegger and U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,937 to Kraska similarly disclose an insert component (in particular, a sphere or ball) press fitted directly into the fillport opening formed by the cell's cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to consistently provide the requisite press-fit sealing between the insert and cover at the fillport opening, the above-described references inherently require that the cover, and in particular the fillport opening, be precisely machined, and requires subjecting both a top and bottom surface of the cover to a finishing operation. As a result, an overall cost of the electrochemical cell, and in particular the cover component, is greatly increased. Further, where, such as with Honegger, the primary weld is formed directly on the insert piece, the electrolyte is in contact with the insert, possibly affecting the subsequently formed weld due to direct conduction of heat. These concerns have been overcome by providing a separate fill tube component that otherwise receives the secondary sealing insert. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,896 to Sunderland et al. discloses an electrochemical cell having a separately formed fill tube welded to an interior (or bottom) of the cover about the fillport opening. The fill tube is precisely machined and sized to receive the insert (i.e., a ball) in a press-fitted relationship. The cover is still formed to define a fillport opening (within which a separate cap component is welded following the press-fitting operation); however, the cover need not adhere to rigorous dimensional standards, as the critical feature is between the inner diameter of the fill tube and the ball insert. Because only the fill tube is precisely machined, an overall cost of the electrochemical cell is reduced as compared to the previously described references in which an entirety of the cover must be exactingly formed. An additional feature associated with this fill tube design is providing a void between the press-fitting insert and the cap that is otherwise welded to the cover. In particular, a getter material, typically in the form of hollow glass bubbles, is placed within this void, and provides an auxiliary design feature for indicating or detecting gross leaks in the primary seal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While highly viable and cost-effective, the evolution of electrochemical cells has raised potential drawbacks. In particular, an entirety of the fill tube extends below the cover (or within the headspace provided within the enclosure). By way of example, a length (or extension into the headspace) of a fill tube associated with available electrochemical cells is on the order of 2.03 mm (0.080 inch). With previous designs, this extension, and thus reduction in available headspace volume, was of little concern due to an overall size of the cell itself. As implantable medical devices continue to become smaller, the electrochemical cells utilized with these devices must also become smaller. Simply stated, future liquid electrolyte-type, electrochemical cells based upon a deep drawn case will need to be reduced in height for various applications. One of the issues associated with shorter cell sizes is utilization of the headspace in the cell to maximize capacity. In general terms, the headspace in these designs is the fixed volume in the cell directly below the cover for the cathode, feedthrough, the fillport components, and the cathode weld attachment. As electrochemical cells get shorter and smaller, this headspace volume remains constant in the cell and occupies a larger percentage of the overall available volume. Unfortunately, the currently employed fill tube assembly design inefficiently occupies a relatively large percentage of the available headspace volume. For a reduced-size, liquid electrolyte-type electrochemical cell, then, these volumetric inefficiencies require a reduction in size of the various active components (e.g., electrode), and thus a reduction in available energy. The energy reduction is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Electrochemical cells continue to be highly important tools for powering various devices, and in particular implantable medical devices. To this end, while certain aspects of electrochemical cells, such as selected chemistries, anode or cathode construction, etc., continue to evolve, the accepted technique for effectuating fillport sealing has essentially remained unchanged. While the provision of a non-welded, secondary seal in conjunction with a welded, primary seal is well-accepted, the volumetric inefficiencies associated with current fill tube assembly designs may impede the ability to produce reduced-sized cells with acceptable available energy levels on a cost effective basis. Therefore, a need exists for an electrochemical cell having a low profile fillport sealing design.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention relates to electrochemical cell including a cell enclosure, a fill tube, a ball, a closing button, an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The cell enclosure defines an internal volume and includes a cover. In this regard, the cover forms an outer face, an inner face, and a fillport through hole. The fill tube is formed separate from the cell enclosure and defines a leading section, a trailing section, and a passageway. In this regard, the leading section is secured within the fillport through hole. The ball is sealingly secured within the passageway of the fill tube. The closing button is also formed separate from the cell enclosure and is sealingly secured within the fillport through hole adjacent the leading section of the fill tube. Finally, the anode, cathode, and electrolyte are contained within the internal volume, with the electrolyte electrically associating the anode and cathode components. By configuring the fill tube such that the leading section thereof is secured within the fillport through hole, an overall extension of the fill tube relative to the inner face of the cover is greatly reduced, thereby maximizing a volumetric efficiency of the electrochemical cell. In one preferred embodiment, inward extension of the fill tube relative to the inner face of the cover at the fillport through hole is less than 2.03 mm (0.08 inch), most preferably, 0.381 mm (0.015 inch).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a cell enclosure for an electrochemical cell including an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The cell enclosure includes a case, a cover, a fill tube, a ball, and a closing button. The cover forms a fillport through hole. The fill tube is formed apart from the cover and defines a leading section, a trailing section, and a passageway. In this regard, the leading section is secured within the fillport through hole such that only a portion of the fill tube extends beyond an inner face of the cover. The ball is sealingly secured within the passageway. The closing button is formed apart from the cover and is sealingly secured within the fillport through hole adjacent the leading section of the fill tube. In one preferred embodiment, the ball is formed of a material that is harder than a material selected for the fill tube. In an even more preferred embodiment, the ball is a Grade 5 titanium material, whereas the fill tube is a Grade 2 titanium material.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of forming an electrochemical cell including an anode and a cathode. The method includes providing a case defining an upper opening. Further, a cover is provided that defines an outer face, an inner face, and a fillport through hole. A fill tube is formed apart from the cover, and defines a leading section, a trailing section, and a passageway. The leading section of the fill tube is secured within the fillport through hole such that the passageway is in fluid communication with the fillport through hole. The cover is sealed to the case at the upper opening, with the case and cover combining to define an internal volume. An electrolyte is dispensed into the internal volume via the fill tube passageway. A ball is pressed into the passageway of the fill tube to form a secondary seal. A closing button is placed into the fillport through hole downstream of the fill tube. Finally, the closing button is sealed to the cover to form a primary seal. In one preferred embodiment, the closing button is welded to the cover, with the secondary seal formed by the ball and the fill tube serving to prevent evaporated electrolyte gas from negatively affecting integrity of the weld. In another preferred embodiment, assembly of the closing button within the fillport through hole includes abutting the closing button against the fill tube.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One exemplary embodiment of an electrochemical cell <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and includes a fillport sealing assembly (referenced generally at <b>12</b>) in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present invention. In general terms, the electrochemical cell includes a cell enclosure <b>14</b> maintaining a variety of internal components including an electrolyte <b>16</b>. The various components are described in greater detail below. In general terms, however, the fillport sealing assembly <b>12</b> is adapted to hermetically seal the electrolyte <b>16</b> within the cell enclosure <b>14</b>, while occupying a minimal amount of the headspace volume.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The specific internal components associated with the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> can vary depending upon the desired end application. In one preferred embodiment, the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> is adapted to power an implantable medical device, such as an implantable drug pump, an implantable neurostimulator, an implantable cardiac pacemaker, a cardiomylostimulator, an implantable cardiac defibrillator, an implantable pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator, etc., all of which are well known in the art. Thus, the internal components otherwise associated with the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> can define the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> as a high-rate cell, medium-rate cell, or low-rate cell. Regardless, in addition to the electrolyte <b>16</b>, the internal components maintained by the cell enclosure <b>14</b> include an anode <b>18</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a cathode <b>20</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The anode <b>18</b> is preferably formed to include lithium. Materials for the cathode <b>20</b> are most preferably solid and comprise as active components thereof metal oxides such as vanadium oxide, silver vanadium oxide (SVO), or manganese dioxide as is known in the art. Alternatively, the cathode <b>20</b> may also comprise carbon monoflouride and hybrids thereof, or any other active electrolytic components and combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood that electrochemical systems other than those set forth explicitly above may also be utilized for the electrochemical cell <b>10</b>, including, but not limited to, anode/cathode systems such as lithium/silver oxide; lithium/manganese oxide; lithium/V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; lithium/copper silver vanadium oxide; lithium/copper oxide; lithium/lead oxide; lithium/carbon monoflouride; lithium/chromium oxide; lithium/bismuth-containing oxide; lithium/copper sulfate; mixtures of various cathode materials listed above such as mixture of silver vanadium oxide and carbon monoflouride; and lithium ion re-chargeable batteries, to name but a few.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In conjunction with the selected materials for the anode <b>18</b> and the cathode <b>20</b>, a variety of construction techniques can be employed, such as a spirally wound battery, stacked plate, serpentine electrodes, etc., all of which are known in the art. To this end, the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> may further include additional components such as an anode current collector <b>22</b>, a cathode current collector <b>24</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrolyte <b>16</b> can similarly assume a wide variety of forms as known in the art. For example, the electrolyte <b>16</b> can include an organic solvent in combination with an ionizing solute. The organic solvent can become, for example, diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, butylen carbonate, 3-methyl-2-oxazolidone, sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran, methyl-substituted tetrahydrofuran, 1-3 dioxolane, polypropylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, gamma-butyrolactone, ethylene glycol sulfite, dimethylsulfite, dimethylsulfoxide, or mixtures thereof and also, for example, low viscosity cosolvents such as tetrahyrdofuran, methyl-substituted tetrahydrofuran, dioxolane, dimethyloxyethane, dimethyl isoxazole, diethyl carbonate, ethylene glycol sulfite, dioxane, dimethyl sulfite, or the like. The ionizing solutes can be a simple or double salt or mixtures thereof, for example, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiClO<sub>4</sub>, LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, Li(SO<sub>3</sub>)(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, LiN(SOCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, or LiC(SO<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which will produce an ionically conductive solution when dissolved in one or more solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Regardless of the exact construction of the anode <b>18</b>, cathode <b>20</b>, the electrolyte <b>16</b> (and other internal components), the cell enclosure <b>14</b> defines an internal volume <b>30</b> (referenced generally) within which the various components (e.g., the electrolyte <b>16</b>, the anode <b>18</b>, the cathode <b>20</b>, etc.) are disposed. In this regard, the cell enclosure <b>14</b> preferably includes a case <b>32</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a cover <b>34</b>. The case <b>32</b> and the cover <b>34</b> are preferably formed of a metal such as stainless steel or titanium, and are welded or otherwise sealed to one another upon final assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The case <b>32</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as assuming a general D-shape. Alternatively, a variety of other shapes are equally acceptable. For example, the case <b>32</b> can be prismatic, rectangular, circular, etc. Similarly, the cover <b>34</b> can assume a variety of other shapes conforming with that of the case <b>32</b>. Further, while the cover <b>34</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as providing an opening <b>36</b> for an appropriate electrical feedthrough <b>38</b>, a variety of other feedthrough configurations are equally acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Regardless of the exact electrochemical cell <b>10</b> construction, the preferred fillport sealing assembly <b>12</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular, the cover <b>34</b> is illustrated as defining a fillport through hole <b>40</b>. The sealing assembly <b>12</b> includes a fill tube <b>42</b>, a spherical or ball insert <b>44</b>, and a closing button <b>46</b>. In general terms, at least a portion of the fill tube <b>42</b> is sealingly secured within the fillport through hole <b>40</b>. The ball <b>44</b> is sealingly disposed within the fill tube <b>42</b>. Finally, the closing button <b>46</b> is sealingly secured within the fillport through hole <b>40</b> above the fill tube <b>42</b> (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The dual seal design prevents electrolyte <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) leakage, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fill tube <b>42</b> is sized in accordance with the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, and preferably defines a leading section <b>50</b>, a trailing section <b>52</b>, and a passageway <b>54</b>. The leading section <b>50</b> defines an outer transverse diameter approximating a diameter of the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, and thus, in one preferred embodiment, has a diameter in the range of 2.29-2.67 mm (0.09-0.105 inch), most preferably 2.49 mm (0.098 inch). Alternatively, other diameters are equally acceptable, so long as the leading section <b>50</b> can be positioned within the fillport through hole <b>40</b> as shown. The leading section <b>50</b> further terminates at a leading surface <b>56</b> that is preferably flat for receiving the closing button <b>46</b> as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The trailing section <b>52</b> extends from the leading section <b>50</b>, and preferably defines an outer diameter less than that of the leading section <b>50</b>. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the trailing section <b>52</b> defines an outer diameter in the range of 1.52-2.03 mm (0.06-0.08 inch), more preferably 1.75 mm (0.069 inch). Alternatively, other dimensions are acceptable, and the trailing section <b>52</b> can define an outer diameter that is equal to, or greater than, that of the leading section <b>50</b>. Regardless, the trailing section <b>52</b> terminates at a trailing surface <b>58</b>. Further, a shoulder <b>60</b> is preferably defined at the transition from the trailing section <b>52</b> to the leading section <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The passageway <b>54</b> defined by the fill tube <b>42</b> is sized in accordance with a diameter of the ball <b>44</b>. In particular, the passageway <b>54</b> has a diameter slightly smaller than that of the ball <b>44</b> such that the ball <b>44</b> can be press-fitted within the passageway <b>54</b> as described below. For example, with a preferred ball <b>44</b> diameter of 0.7937 mm (0.03125 inch), the passageway <b>54</b> has a preferred diameter of 0.737 mm (0.029 inch). Notably, this one preferred passageway <b>54</b> diameter of 0.737 mm (0.029 inch) has surprisingly been found amenable to available electrolyte charging or filling procedures, but is significantly smaller than available fill tube passageway diameters typically on the order of 1.52 mm (0.06 inch). Of course, the passageway <b>54</b> diameter can vary depending upon a size of the ball <b>44</b>. Additionally, an overall longitudinal height or length of the passageway <b>54</b> approximates, or preferably is slightly greater than, a diameter of the ball <b>44</b>. Once again, with reference to a preferred ball <b>44</b> diameter of 0.7937 mm (0.03125 inch), the passageway <b>54</b> preferably has a longitudinal length of approximately 0.813 mm (0.032 inch). While other lengths can be employed, the preferred axial length of the passageway <b>54</b> is significantly smaller than that associated with other fill tube configurations that otherwise establish a passageway length on the order of 2.03 mm (0.08 inch). In this regard, and as described in greater detail below, the leading section <b>50</b> is preferably configured to provide a longitudinal length sufficient to support the fill tube <b>42</b> within the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, while minimizing an inward extension of the trailing section <b>52</b> relative to the cover <b>34</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the leading section <b>50</b> has a longitudinal length in the range of 0.305-0.559 mm (0.012-0.022 inch), more preferably 0.432 mm (0.017 inch), whereas the trailing section <b>52</b> has a longitudinal length in the range of 0.25-0.51 mm (0.01-0.02 inch), more preferably 0.381 (0.015 inch). Finally, the passageway <b>54</b> is preferably enlarged or chamfered at both the leading and trailing surfaces <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition to the various preferred dimensional attributes described above, the fill tube <b>42</b> is further formed from a material selected in accordance with a material of the ball <b>44</b>. More particularly, the ball <b>44</b> material is preferably harder than the material selected for the fill tube <b>42</b>. This one preferred construction facilitates formation of a liquid tight seal between the ball <b>44</b> and the fill tube <b>42</b> upon press-fitting of the ball <b>44</b> within the passageway <b>54</b>, as the fill tube <b>42</b> will effectively plastically deform about the ball <b>44</b>. With this in mind, and in one preferred embodiment, the fill tube <b>42</b> is preferably formed of a Grade 2 titanium material, whereas the ball <b>44</b> is preferably formed of a Grade 5 titanium material. Alternatively, other materials may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The closing button <b>46</b> is sized in accordance with a diameter defined by the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, and is formed from an acceptable material such as stainless steel or titanium. Unlike previous designs, however, the closing button <b>46</b> has a thickness or height that is less than that of the cover <b>34</b> in the region of the fillport through hole <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, assembly of the electrochemical cell <b>10</b> includes providing the case <b>32</b> (e.g., a deep drawn technique), and assembly of various internal components therein (e.g., the anode <b>18</b> and the cathode <b>20</b>) in accordance with available techniques. The cover <b>34</b> is likewise provided, sized in conjunction with a size and configuration of the case <b>32</b>. In this regard, the cover <b>34</b> may include a number features, such as the feedthrough opening <b>36</b>, but is formed to include the fillport through hole <b>40</b>. In this regard, the cover <b>34</b> need not be precisely machined. Instead, the cover <b>34</b>, and in particular the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, can be formed by a relatively inexpensive manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fill tube <b>42</b> is then sealed to the cover <b>34</b>, and in particular within the fillport through hole <b>40</b>. In this regard, the cover <b>34</b> generally defines an outer face <b>70</b> and an inner face <b>72</b> (with the terms &#x201c;outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;inner&#x201d; being in reference to a position of the cover <b>34</b> relative to the internal volume <b>30</b> upon final assembly). With this designation in mind, the leading section <b>50</b> of the fill tube <b>42</b> is positioned within the fillport through hole <b>40</b> such that the shoulder <b>60</b> is approximately aligned with the inner face <b>72</b> of the cover <b>34</b>. The fill tube <b>42</b> is then sealed to the cover <b>34</b>, for example, via a weld (referenced generally at <b>74</b>). Thus, at least a portion of the fill tube <b>42</b> (e.g., the leading section <b>50</b>) is disposed within the fillport through hole <b>40</b>, and only a portion of the fill tube <b>42</b> (e.g., the trailing section <b>52</b>) extends inwardly (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) relative to the inner face <b>72</b> of the cover <b>34</b>. Notably, this is in direct contrast to previous designs in which an entirety of the fill tube <b>42</b> extends downwardly from the inner face <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The combination cover <b>34</b>/fill tube <b>42</b> is then assembled or sealed to the case <b>32</b> as shown, with the cover <b>34</b> encompassing an opening <b>76</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) otherwise defined by the case <b>32</b>. For example, the cover <b>34</b> can be welded to the case <b>32</b>. The fill tube <b>42</b> construction in accordance with the present invention dramatically reduces the amount of headspace volume occupied by the fill tube <b>42</b>. By way of reference, previous fill tube-type sealing assembly designs incorporate a fill tube having a longitudinal length, and thus downward extension relative to the cover <b>34</b>, of approximately 2.03 mm (0.08 inch). Conversely, the present invention preferably provides a downward extension of less than 2.03 mm (0.08 inch). That is to say, upon final assembly, the trailing surface <b>58</b> extends less than 2.03 mm (0.08 inch), more preferably less than 1.27 mm (0.05 inch), from a plane defined by the inner face <b>72</b> in the region of the fillport through hole <b>40</b> (it being understood that depending upon a particular design, region(s) of the cover <b>34</b> apart from the fillport through hole <b>40</b> may define a &#x201c;lower&#x201d; point or plane). In an even more preferred embodiment, the fill tube <b>42</b> is configured such that the trailing surface <b>58</b> extends approximately 0.381 mm (0.015 inch) relative to the inner face <b>72</b> at the fillport through hole <b>40</b>. Preferably, however, the fill tube <b>42</b> is configured such that upon final assembly, the leading section <b>50</b> does not encompass an entirety of the cover's <b>34</b> thickness. With this preferred construction, sufficient room is available for subsequent assembly of the closing button <b>46</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the cover <b>34</b> assembled to the case <b>32</b>, the electrolyte <b>16</b> is then charged or dispensed into the enclosed region <b>30</b> via the fillport through hole <b>40</b> and the passageway <b>54</b>, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once a desired volume of the electrolyte <b>16</b> has been dispensed within the enclosed region <b>30</b>, the ball <b>44</b> is press-fitted or interference-fitted into the passageway <b>54</b> of the fill tube <b>42</b>. Once again, and in a preferred embodiment, the ball <b>44</b> is formed of the material harder than that of the fill tube <b>42</b> and defines a slightly greater diameter than that of the passageway <b>54</b> such that this press-fitting operation results in a seal being formed between the ball <b>44</b> of the fill tube <b>42</b>. The seal achieved between the ball <b>44</b> and the fill tube <b>42</b> is hereinafter referenced as the &#x201c;secondary seal&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower seal&#x201d; (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and seals the electrolyte <b>16</b> within the internal volume <b>30</b>. This secondary seal prevents the electrolyte <b>16</b> from passing or leaking beyond (or downstream of) the ball <b>44</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the ball <b>44</b> is sized to be slightly smaller than a longitudinal height of the passageway <b>54</b> (e.g., preferably in the range of 0.00635-0.025 mm (0.00025-0.001 inch); more preferably approximately 0.0190 mm (0.00075 inch)), such that an entirety of the ball <b>44</b> is contained within the passageway <b>54</b>. That is to say, in a preferred embodiment, the ball <b>44</b> does not extend beyond (or below relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) the trailing surface <b>58</b>, and thus does not unnecessarily occupy available headspace volume. Additionally, the ball <b>44</b> is preferably positioned within the passageway <b>54</b> in approximate alignment with a plane defined by the leading surface <b>56</b>. By preferably forming the fill tube <b>42</b> from a Grade 2 titanium material and the ball <b>44</b> from a Grade 5 titanium material, the secondary seal provides a helium leak rate of less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>std. cc/second.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After the ball <b>44</b> has been inserted, a portion of the fillport through hole <b>40</b> not otherwise occupied by the fill tube <b>42</b> is preferably cleaned, and the closing button <b>46</b> inserted therein. In a preferred embodiment, an interior surface <b>78</b> of the closing button <b>46</b> abuts or rests on top of the leading surface <b>56</b> of the fill tube <b>42</b>, whereas an exterior surface <b>80</b> is substantially flush with the outer face <b>70</b> of the cover <b>34</b>. Thus, the fill tube <b>42</b> serves to not only support the ball <b>44</b>, but also the closing button <b>46</b>. Further, and as previously described, the ball <b>44</b> is preferably positioned within the passageway <b>54</b> so as to be substantially aligned with a plane of the leading surface <b>56</b>. As such, upon placement of the closing button <b>46</b> against the leading surface <b>56</b>, the closing button <b>46</b> is in highly close proximity to the ball <b>44</b>. In one preferred embodiment, a spacing between the closing button <b>46</b> and the ball <b>44</b> is less than approximately 0.0190 mm (0.00075 inch); more preferably, the closing button <b>46</b> contacts the ball <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once positioned, the closing button <b>46</b> is sealed to the cover <b>34</b>, such as by a weld <b>82</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The preferred weld <b>82</b> establishes a primary seal (or &#x201c;upper seal&#x201d; relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for the fillport through hole <b>40</b>. Because the secondary seal established between the ball <b>44</b> and the fill tube <b>42</b> prevents passage of the electrolyte <b>16</b> (in either liquid or gaseous form) into the closing button weld zone, the primary seal will consistently provide a helium leak rate of less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>std. cc/second.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electrochemical cell, and in particular fillport sealing assembly, of the present invention provides a marked improvement over previous designs. The fill tube configuration and assembly provides a low profile design in which only a minimal amount of available headspace volume is occupied by the fill tube as compared to previous designs. As a result, the size of other active components (e.g., the electrode) can be increased, thereby increasing an available energy of the electrochemical cell. By incorporating the sealing assembly of the present invention, then, available electrochemical cell can be dramatically reduced in overall size with minimal impact on energy capacity. Further, the primary and secondary seals achieved with the present invention provide a helium leak rate of less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>std. cc/second, such that the chances of electrolyte leaking from the cell enclosure are greatly reduced, surprisingly to a level whereby the gross leak detection afforded by glass bubbles (or other getter material) is no longer necessary. In effect, both seals would have to leak for electrolyte leakage to occur. Thus, the electrochemical cell is highly useful for a variety of applications, and in particular for use with implantable medical devices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, embodiments of the electrochemical cell with fillport sealing assembly are disclosed. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention can be practiced with embodiments other than those disclosed. The disclosed embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow.</p>
