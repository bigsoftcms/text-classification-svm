<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates, in general, to a solar collecting system and, more particularly, to a solar collecting system that tracks the sun and maintains a constant focal point or sub-focal point to at least partially condense the sun's rays into a high-energy beam that is then redirected to a predetermined location for generating electrical power, heat energy, steam, and/or any other well-known application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solar energy has been available as a source of power for more than 4.5 billion years. For centuries, inventors have been devising various means to harness this energy. As far back as the third century B.C., records indicate that the Greek and Roman armies used &#x201c;burning mirrors&#x201d; to focus sunlight as weapons of war to ignite fires and to burn sails of enemy warships. In 1767, Swiss scientist Herace de Saussure invented the first solar collector (solar hotbox). In the 1880's, engineer John Ericsson, the first American solar scientist, developed a solar driven engine for a ship and 1954 saw the birth of the solar cell or photovoltaic. In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the White House and began promoting different incentives for companies that developed and/or used solar energy systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Solar energy provides the world either directly or indirectly with the majority of its energy. Solar energy is a renewable energy source having vast potential. Although solar energy is abundant, a major drawback is that it is diffuse and not available at all hours. Solar energy can be affected by the time of the day, the seasons, and the changing sun path in the sky as the earth's axis is not at a right angle to the sun but is tilted away at an angle of 23.5&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For decades, inventors have tried various systems for harnessing this incredible energy source. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,988,166; 4,286,581; 5,275,149; and 4,038,971 have sought to control and convert this energy into a cost-effective usable form. Unfortunately, these systems are cumbersome, expensive to manufacture and maintain, expensive to operate and yield little in terms of usable, convertible energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although state and federal incentives are available, it is not yet economical to harness solar energy on a large scale to produce electricity. However, the high cost of traditional energy sources and the energy shortage are presenting a significant burden on many countries. Also, these traditional sources have numerous drawbacks such as pollution and the limited amounts of fossil fuels available.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Solar energy is the hope for an endless energy supply, as it is cheap, clean, and pollution free. There is a need in the art to develop a cost effective, easy to operate, relatively maintenance free solar energy system to harness and convert solar energy into a viable energy alternative to traditional sources.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a solar energy collecting system that is a cost effective, relatively maintenance free alternative to traditional energy sources.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the invention to provide a solar energy collecting system that is capable of efficiently converting energy from the sun into electricity, heat energy and/or steam.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a solar energy collecting system that is capable of being easily adjusted to maximize the sun's rays across the arc of the sky and according to seasonal changes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is still yet another object of the invention to provide a solar energy collecting system that is capable of condensing the sun's rays and redirecting them as needed to maximize their energy potential.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to the various objects and advantages of the invention which have been described in some specific detail above it should be noted that various other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those persons who are skilled in the relevant art from the following more detailed description, particularly, when such description is taken in conjunction with the attached drawing Figures and with the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Briefly, and in accordance with the forgoing objectives, the invention comprises a solar collecting system for generating electrical power, heat energy, and/or steam comprising a parabolic solar collector panel having a predetermined radius capable of receiving rays of the sun moving along a first path. A first arm for mounting the solar collector panel in a position capable of receiving the rays and reflecting the rays along a second path to one of a focal point, which is &#xbd; the predetermined radius of the collector panel, and a sub-focal point, which is less than &#xbd; this predetermined radius, where the rays become at least partially condensed. At least one deflecting mirror is mounted above the solar collector panel at substantially one of the focal point and the sub-focal point for receiving the condensed rays and redirecting these rays along at least a third path different from the first and second paths. A means is provided for mounting the at least one deflecting mirror. A gear assembly is attached to the first arm. The gear assembly has a center portion, which is inline with the focal point or the sub-focal point to form an imaginary axis. Means are provided for operating the gear assembly to rotate the collector panel according to movement of the sun such that the collector panel travels over an arc path, the center of which is either the focal point or sub-focal point of the collector panel. This collector panel travels over the arc path which is &#xbd; of the radius or less than &#xbd; the radius of the collector panel. The collector panel travels over the arc path, which is perpendicular with respect to the imaginary axis extending from the center portion of the gear assembly, one of the focal point and the sub-focal point, and a center portion of the deflecting mirror. The means for operating the gear assembly maintains the collector panel in a position, which is perpendicular with the sun's rays. A final target is provided for receiving the condensed rays from the third path and converting these rays into one of electrical power, heat energy and/or steam.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Prior to proceeding to a more detailed description of the invention, it should be noted that identical components having identical functions have been designated with identical reference numerals for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to adequately harness the sun's energy, it is necessary for a solar collector system to use a solar collector panel that is formed from a reflective material and has a substantial surface area. The best types of these collectors are in the form of parabolic, spherical, or concave mirror (s) having a predetermined radius. The rays from the sun shine down upon the surface of the collector panel and reflect back to what is called a &#x201c;focal point&#x201d;. This focal point is &#xbd; the radius of the parabolic collector panel. These rays become condensed at the focal point. By controlling the path of these condensed rays and then redirecting these rays as a single beam to a collecting and/or converting device, one is able to generate and convert a large amount of energy into a usable resource.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-12</figref>, there is shown a solar collecting system, generally indicated as <b>10</b>, for generating electrical power, heat energy, and/or steam. The solar collecting system comprises a parabolic solar collector panel <b>12</b> having a predetermined radius &#x201c;R&#x201d; which is capable of receiving rays <b>14</b> of the sun moving along a first path <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, these rays <b>14</b> are parallel to one another as they move along first path <b>16</b>. The solar collecting panel <b>12</b> can be formed from any well-known reflective material such as a mirror or stainless steel and the like. Additionally, photovoltaic cells and photocells may be placed onto the panel in combination with the reflective material or the panel may be formed only from photovoltaic cells and/or photocells.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system further comprises a first arm <b>18</b> having a first end <b>20</b> and a second end <b>22</b>. The first end <b>20</b> has the solar collector panel <b>12</b> mounted thereon in a position capable of receiving the rays <b>14</b> moving along the first path <b>16</b> and reflecting these rays along a second path <b>24</b> to one of a focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and/or a sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is any location between the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; and the collector panel <b>12</b>. The rays <b>14</b> become condensed to substantially a single beam at the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;. At the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, the rays are partially condensed in such a manner that they may be gathered and redirected by the reflecting mirror <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The at least one deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is mounted above the solar collector panel <b>12</b> at either the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; or the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d; for receiving the condensed, reflected rays moving along the second path <b>24</b> and redirecting these rays along at least a third path <b>28</b> which is different from the first <b>16</b> and second <b>24</b> paths.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Means are provided for mounting the at least one deflecting mirror <b>26</b>. This means can be any well-known mounting means such as a rod or pole <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, attached to the first arm <b>18</b> and extending perpendicular with respect to the collecting panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to a second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, a second arm <b>31</b>, having a first end <b>32</b> and a second end <b>33</b> extends above and parallel with a portion of the collecting panel <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, a crossbeam <b>35</b> extends between the first arm <b>18</b> and the second arm <b>31</b> for connecting this first arm <b>18</b> and second arm <b>31</b> to form a frame assembly <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, a gear assembly <b>34</b> is attached to the second end <b>22</b> of the first arm <b>18</b>. The gear assembly <b>34</b> has a center portion <b>36</b> that is inline with one of the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; and the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d; to form an imaginary axis <b>38</b>. According to the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, the gear assembly <b>34</b> is attached to the second end <b>33</b> of the second arm <b>31</b> such that the center portion <b>36</b> of the gear assembly is inline with the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; and/or the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Means, such as a motor, battery, photovoltaic energy, as discussed below, or any other well-known means, are provided for operating the gear assembly <b>34</b> to rotate the collector panel <b>12</b> and the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>, or in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9-12</figref> embodiment, the frame assembly <b>37</b>, according to movement of the sun. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the collector panel <b>12</b> travels over an arc path, &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;A<b>3</b>&#x201d;, the center of which is the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; of the collector panel <b>12</b>. When the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is at the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;, this arc path is &#xbd; the radius &#x201c;R&#x201d; of the collector panel. When the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is at the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, this arc path is less than &#xbd; the radius &#x201c;R&#x201d; of the collector panel. The collector panel <b>12</b> traveling over the arc path &#x201c;A<b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;A<b>2</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;A<b>3</b>&#x201d; ensures that the collector panel <b>12</b> remains perpendicular with respect to the imaginary axis <b>38</b> extending from the center portion <b>36</b> of the gear assembly <b>34</b>, either one of the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; or the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, and a center portion <b>40</b> of the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>. By moving along this path, the collector panel <b>12</b> remains in a position that is perpendicular with the sun's rays at all times, maximizing the amount of sun energy applied to the collector panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A final target, such as a turbine <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is provided for receiving the condensed rays from the third path <b>28</b> and converting these rays into one of electrical power, heat energy and/or steam. It is recognized that any well-known target for receiving the condensed rays and converting these rays in a usable energy form may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> a diffracting/refracting means may be provided along the imaginary axis <b>38</b> inline with the center portion <b>36</b> of the gear assembly <b>34</b> and the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>. This diffracting/refracting means can comprise a lens box or frame <b>42</b> containing one or more lenses <b>43</b> to divert the rays moving along the third path <b>28</b> according to a predetermined location i.e. the final target <b>44</b>. The at least one lens <b>43</b> can have one of a concave, convex, cylindrical shape, and any combination thereof capable of correcting any distortion of the condensed rays <b>14</b> being sent to the predetermined location.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A fiber optic cable <b>48</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be provided which would allow for the movement of the condensed rays <b>14</b> from the diffracting/refracting means <b>42</b> to the final target <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A first means <b>50</b> for cooling one of the lens box and/or lens frame <b>42</b> and/or the fiber optic cable <b>48</b> can be provided. A second means <b>52</b> for cooling the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> can also be provided. These first and second cooling means <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can comprise any well-known cooling means such as a fan and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is well known that the sun is the highest over the Northern Hemisphere on June 21<sup>st</sup>, which is the longest day of the year, and highest over the Southern hemisphere on December 21<sup>st </sup>or 22<sup>nd </sup>Consequently, the sun is at its lowest over the Northern Hemisphere when it is the highest over the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. The sun is half way between the equinoxes at about March 21<sup>st </sup>and September 23<sup>rd</sup>. The system of the present invention is capable of being easily adjusted to ensure that the solar collector panel remains perpendicular to the sun according to the season and the sun arc in the sky. These adjustments can be readily performed by one having ordinary skill in the art simply by changing the tilt of the collector system <b>10</b>, such as via adjustment legs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, with respect to the location of the sun to optimize the amount of sun energy applied to the solar collector panel <b>12</b>. Any other well-known means may be used to adjust the tilt of the collector system <b>10</b> of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, parallel sunrays hitting the surface of a parabolic or spherical mirror that is facing the sun will result in the rays being reflected back to a focus point &#x201c;F&#x201d; which is &#xbd; the radius of the sphere. The focus point &#x201c;F&#x201d; of the gathered sunrays shall also condense the temperature (thermal) to several folds (up to hundreds or thousands). Light, whether parallel or nonparallel, when hitting the surface of a regular mirror at a 45&#xb0; shall get deflected 90&#xb0;. The present invention capitalizes on these facts by mounting the at least one deflecting mirror <b>26</b> at an approximately 45&#xb0; angle with respect to either the focal point or the sub-focal point. The sun travel from east to west is capable of concentrating the rays from the second path <b>24</b> at the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; (and at least partially condensing the rays at the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;) and redirecting the rays along the third path <b>28</b> at an approximately 90&#xb0; angle with respect to the first path <b>16</b>. As the solar collector panel <b>12</b> and the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> rotate to follow the sun's path and maintain the sun's rays substantially perpendicular with respect to the panel, the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>, mounted at the focus point &#x201c;F&#x201d; or a sub-focus point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, will continue to receive these condensed rays and redirect these rays to the desired target, 44. It should be noted that the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> may be pointed at the 45&#xb0; angle in either the North or South position depending upon the location of the final target <b>44</b> so that the rays sent along the third path <b>28</b> are directed toward this final target <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>12</b> show embodiments utilizing a split mirror <b>54</b> as the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>. The split mirror <b>54</b> is preferable used when the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is at the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;, however, it can also be used when the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is at the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;. The split mirror <b>54</b> comprises a larger mirror <b>56</b> having a center mirror portion <b>58</b> mounted at an opposite angle with respect to the larger mirror <b>56</b>. In this embodiment, and as shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>, the rays are split and sent in opposing directions. The larger mirror <b>56</b> is capable of redirecting a first portion of the condensed rays along a third path <b>57</b> and the center mirror <b>58</b> is capable of redirecting a second portion of the condensed rays along a fourth path <b>59</b> which is in an opposite direction from the third path <b>57</b>. Preferably, the larger mirror <b>56</b> and the center mirror <b>58</b> are mounted at approximately 90&#xb0; with respect to each other and mounted at an approximately 45&#xb0; angle with respect to substantially one of the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; and/or the sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d; for redirecting the condensed rays along the third <b>57</b> and fourth <b>59</b> paths at approximately 90&#xb0; with respect to first path <b>16</b> and at approximately 180&#xb0; with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The use of the split mirror <b>54</b> is especially advantageous with the design of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second arm for mounting the deflecting mirror <b>26</b> comprises a tubular member <b>70</b> enclosing a fiber-optic cord <b>72</b> For transmitting the rays <b>14</b> along the fourth path <b>59</b>. Valves <b>74</b> extending along the length of the tubular member <b>70</b> are provided to allow a cooling medium to circulate inside tubular member <b>70</b> and around the fiber optic cord <b>72</b> and adjacent to the split mirror deflecting mirror <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The solar collecting system <b>10</b> of the invention is designed such that the at least one deflecting mirror <b>26</b> is capable of being removed from the mounting means <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and the mounting means is capable of receiving a replacement deflecting mirror. This would allow one to change one of the size and/or shape of the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>, replace the deflecting mirror with a split mirror <b>54</b>, and/or to perform maintenance on the deflecting mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The solar collecting panel <b>12</b> of the invention can comprise any shape capable of maintaining a constant focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;. For example, as opposed to the circular shape shown in the drawings, the collecting panel <b>12</b> can have straight edges so that a series of panels <b>12</b> may be mounted next to each other to maximize the amount of solar energy applied to the collector panels <b>12</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, the collecting panel <b>12</b> can be formed from removable components comprising one of a series of multiple mirrors <b>60</b> of varying, sizes and/or shapes, a series of photovoltaic cells, and a combination of mirrors and photovoltaic cells as long as each of these components have the same predetermined radius &#x201c;R&#x201d; which is capable of maintaining the constant focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;. By forming the collector panel <b>12</b> from removable components <b>60</b> one is able to remove one or more components for maintenance and/or replacement thereof without the expense of having to replace the entire collector panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, one can provide at least one photovoltaic cell sheet <b>62</b> mounted on the solar collector panel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The sun energy applied to this cell sheet is capable of providing enough energy for operating the motor of the gear assembly <b>34</b> and/or any other accessory item of the system <b>10</b> i.e. cooling fans and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref> show an embodiment wherein the solar collector panel <b>12</b> comprises a deep-dish parabolic panel <b>64</b>. The collector panel <b>12</b> may be replaced with the deep dish panel <b>64</b> or a traditionally size collector panel <b>12</b> may be converted to a deep dish panel by means of a series of foldable flaps <b>66</b> having a predetermined curvature attached to a top rim of the parabolic panel <b>12</b> by means of hinges <b>68</b> or any other well-known means, which are capable of being folded upright to form the deep dish parabolic panel <b>64</b>. The predetermined curvature of the series of flaps <b>66</b> forming the deep dish parabolic panel <b>64</b> must be equal to the predetermined radius &#x201c;R&#x201d; of the collector panel <b>12</b>, to maintain a constant focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;. Also, these foldable flaps <b>66</b> must have a predetermined height that does not exceed the level of the radius of the parabolic collector panel. If this height is exceeded, such as above the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d;, then the rays will be blocked from the edge portions of the panel, compromising the total amount of reflective surface.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The series of flaps <b>66</b> can be formed from one of reflecting mirrors, photovoltaic material, and a combination of mirrors and photovoltaic material. These flaps may also be formed from a plurality of mirrors and photovoltaic panels that can be removed for maintenance and/or replacement as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When using a deep-dish panel <b>64</b>, a window <b>76</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref>, must be provided for allowing the redirected rays <b>14</b> moving along the third path <b>28</b> to escape through the panel <b>64</b>. If a split mirror deflecting mirror <b>54</b> is being used, a pair of windows <b>76</b> in opposing side portions of the panel <b>64</b> are provided for sending redirected rays moving along the third and fourth paths <b>57</b>, <b>59</b> to escape through deep dish collector panel <b>64</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, one of the windows <b>76</b> allows the second arm <b>31</b> to enter therethrough to mount the deflecting mirror <b>26</b>, <b>54</b>, and, if using the split mirror <b>54</b> embodiment, sending redirected rays moving along the fourth path <b>59</b> to escape through panel via fiber optic cord <b>72</b>, as discussed in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention further includes means to move one of the first arm and the means for mounting the deflecting mirror in a vertical direction to change the distance between the solar collector panel and the deflecting mirror from the focal point &#x201c;F&#x201d; to sub-focal point &#x201c;SF&#x201d;. Any well-known adjusting means can be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the height of rod or pole <b>30</b> or the height of the collector panel with respect to first arm <b>18</b> can be adjustable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>, a nut/bolt arrangement <b>78</b> and a plurality of holes <b>80</b> can be provided along the crossbeam <b>35</b> to allow for the adjustment of the collector panel <b>12</b> with respect to the second arm <b>31</b>. Alternatively, the system can be configured such that the second arm <b>31</b> is movable with respect to the collector panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</figref> also show an optional protective cover <b>82</b> which may be formed from a clear or semi-clear plastic material. This plastic cover <b>82</b> can have a dome shape that can be opened partially or fully to cover the collecting system <b>10</b> of the invention in case of inclement weather. The system of the present invention can be modified as needed for a particular energy need. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a plurality of collector panels, such as a traditional collector panel <b>12</b> in combination with a deep-dish panel <b>64</b>, may be used to provide sufficient energy to operate turbine <b>44</b>. Also, in case of inclement weather, back-up energy systems, such as a windmill <b>84</b>, other stored energy devices and/or energy devices capable of storing excess solar energy produce by the system, can be provided to work in tandem with the system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention also provides for a photosensitive tracking system for tracking the path of the sun arc for use with the solar collecting system <b>10</b>. This tracking system comprises a photocell <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>. The photocell <b>90</b> is placed within the bottom of an upright cone shaped funnel <b>92</b>. This funnel <b>92</b> is mounted either on the face of the at least one solar collecting panel <b>12</b> or adjacent to an outer edge portion of the at least one solar collecting panel <b>12</b>. This cone shape funnel <b>92</b> can be mounted by any well-known means, i.e. adhesive, fusion, and the like, such that the upright portion is facing the sun. The funnel <b>92</b> is formed from a dark material such that light from the sun can only enter through the top portion thereof and contact the photocell <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Means are provided for communicating a signal from the photocell <b>90</b> to the power source operating gear assembly <b>34</b>, such that when sunlight is entering into the upright funnel <b>92</b> and contacts photocell <b>90</b>, the signal causes the power source to pause the rotation of the at least one solar collecting panel <b>12</b> until sunlight is no longer entering into the funnel <b>92</b>. This pause in the rotation of the collecting panel <b>12</b> results in a face portion of the solar collecting panel <b>12</b> to remain in a substantially perpendicular position with respect to the sun. Consequently, as soon as the sun moves with respect to the photocell <b>90</b> so that the sun is no longer shining down into the funnel <b>92</b>, a signal is sent to the gear operating motor to continue rotation of the solar collecting panel <b>12</b> at a speed that is comparable with the arc speed of the sun.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The photosensitive tracking system of the invention also provides a reference point on the solar collecting panel <b>12</b> to indicate a need for adjustment of the panel as a result of seasonal changes to optimize the amount of sun energy applied to the solar collector panel <b>12</b>. Due to the perpendicular placement of the cone shaped funnel <b>92</b> with respect to the solar collecting panel, one having ordinary skill in the art can determined the need for adjustment based upon the location of shadows reflected on the panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is shown a turbine, generally indicated as <b>100</b>, of which the rays <b>14</b>, moving along the third path <b>28</b>, can be applied in order to produce a rotational force which can be converted into electricity. The turbine casing is comprised of a black absorbent material capable of retaining heat therein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>, a medium <b>102</b>, such as liquid/compressed air or distilled water enters the turbine via one-way valve <b>114</b>. This medium is then heated to a temperature of approximately 800-900&#xb0; F. by the solar energy applied directly to the sidewall of the turbine <b>100</b>, causing the medium to expand and increase the pressure within the turbine <b>100</b>. This pressure increase causes the fans/plates <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> to rotate, drawing air into the turbine from the inlet <b>118</b> and exhausting this air through the outlet <b>120</b>. The force of the pressure within the turbine <b>100</b> decreases as it moves through the turbine from the first set of fans/plates <b>116</b> to the second set of fans/plates <b>117</b>. The maintenance of the pressure within the turbine <b>100</b> is controlled by a series of safety gages, feeding gages, pressure relief valves and temperature sensors. The force of the pressure differential within the turbine <b>100</b> causes the fans/plates <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> to rotate in a single direction which consequently causes the shaft <b>118</b> to rotate. This rotational energy can then be converted into electrical energy by a connection to a generator or any other well known means. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, additional rotating members <b>124</b> can be provided which contact the inside surface of the turbine <b>100</b> to provide additional rotational force and control of the movement of the air, as well as, provide additional stability to the shaft.</p>
