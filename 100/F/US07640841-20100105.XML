<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure, in general, relates to annular seals and pumps including such annular seals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditionally, seals are used to prevent fluids from flowing between joints of rigid components. In particular examples, seals are used in pumps and between flanges to limit fluid flow out of containment regions. For example, seals along pump shafts may limit lubricating fluids or pressurized process fluids from escaping along an annulus defined by the shaft and a housing. Typically, such seals have been formed of malleable materials, such as graphite or metal strips in the case of flange seals or elastomeric materials in the case of shaft seals. However, traditional materials have proven ill suited for new applications, such as high-pressure liquid chromatography systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">High-pressure liquid chromatography uses a high-pressure liquid carrier medium to separate chemical species by moving the species across an adsorption medium. Different chemical components adsorb on and desorb from the adsorption medium at different rates, resulting in separation of the components as the carrier medium moves through or around the adsorption medium. To avoid contamination of the adsorption medium, some typical pumps are designed to operate without the use of lubricants because the liquid carrier medium used in such high-pressure liquid chromatography systems often acts as a strong solvent and lubricant dissolved in such solvents may contaminate adsorption media. Further, the liquid carrier medium may adversely affect sealing materials and the high pressure of such mediums may lead to leaking and low seal lifetimes. Other typical seal designs may increase wear on pump components, such as rods or shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, an improved seal and an improved pump for use in such systems would be desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The annular sealing surface includes an annular ridge protruding substantially radially from the annular sealing surface. The seal body includes an annular cavity. The seal also includes first and second annular springs located adjacent to each other in the annular cavity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a particular embodiment, a seal includes a seal body forming an annular sealing surface. The seal body includes an annular ridge protruding substantially radially from the annular sealing surface. In addition, the seal body includes an annular cavity. The seal further includes first and second annular springs located adjacent to each other in the annular cavity. In an example, the seal body may further include a second annular sealing surface. The second annular sealing surface may radially overlie the first annular sealing surface along a radial vector and may form an opposite annular sealing surface to the first annular sealing surface. Further, the seal body may include a second annular ridge protruding radially from the second annular sealing surface. In a particular example, the seal body is formed of a composite material including a fluoropolymer, an aromatic polymer, and graphite fiber. The seal may be included in a pump. For example, the first annular surface may contact a rod of the pump and a second annular surface may contact a housing, thus preventing fluid flow in an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an illustration of a portion <b>102</b> of an exemplary pump. As illustrated, directional indicator &#x201c;r&#x201d; represents a radial direction and directional indicator &#x201c;a&#x201d; represents an axial direction. The portion <b>102</b> of the pump may include a housing <b>104</b> having an axial bore through which a rod <b>116</b> is inserted. A seal body <b>106</b> is located between the housing <b>104</b> and the rod <b>116</b>. As illustrated, the housing <b>104</b> includes first and second portions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> configured to engage a flange <b>108</b> of the seal body <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the housing <b>104</b> may be formed as a single piece. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flange <b>108</b> extends radially at one axial end of the seal body <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the seal body <b>106</b> may be formed without a flange.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an exemplary embodiment, the seal body <b>106</b> forms an annular sealing surface <b>110</b> configured to contact the rod <b>116</b>. In addition, the seal body <b>106</b> forms an annular sealing surface <b>118</b> configured to contact the housing <b>104</b>. An annular sealing surface is a surface configured to seal against an opposing surface and configured to extend axially and circumferentially along the surface of an annular shape, such as the seal body <b>106</b>. As illustrated, the annular sealing surface <b>110</b> forms an innermost annular sealing surface for direct contact with the rod <b>116</b>. In another example, the annular sealing surface <b>118</b> forms an axial and circumferential surface along an outermost portion of the annular seal body <b>106</b> that is configured to directly contact the housing <b>104</b>. In a particular embodiment, the annular sealing surface <b>110</b> and the annular sealing surface <b>118</b> form opposite sides of the seal <b>106</b> and are configured to be substantially parallel when engaged between the housing <b>104</b> and the rod <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the seal body <b>106</b> includes an annular cavity <b>114</b>, housing first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. The first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are located adjacent to each other. As illustrated, the first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> may be located axially adjacent to each other along a line (not shown) parallel to the rod or the axial direction. Alternatively, the first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> may be radially adjacent to each other along a line (not shown) extending in the radial direction. In a particular example, the first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> may directly contact each other or may include sheaths that directly contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the seal body <b>106</b> defines an opening <b>130</b> to the cavity <b>114</b>. The opening <b>130</b> may be located at an axially end of the seal body <b>106</b>. For example, the opening <b>130</b> may be located at an axial end of the seal body <b>106</b> opposite the axial end of the flange <b>108</b>. In a particular embodiment, the opening <b>130</b> is associated with the low-pressure side of the pump. Alternatively, the opening <b>130</b> may be associated with the high-pressure side of the pump. Further, the seal body <b>106</b> may define an annular lip <b>128</b> at the opening <b>130</b>. In an example, the annular lip <b>128</b> is located on a rod side of the opening <b>130</b>. Alternatively, the annular lip may be located on the housing side of the opening <b>130</b>. In another example, the opening <b>130</b> may be defined by two annular lips.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sectioning line S extending radially through the cavity bisects the annular sealing surface <b>110</b> and the annular sealing surface <b>118</b>. For example, the annular sealing surface <b>118</b> and the cavity may overlie the annular sealing surface <b>110</b> when viewed outwardly along the sectioning line S or along a radial vector extending outwardly. In a particular example, the cavity <b>114</b> when viewed along sectioning lines extending through each axial end of the cavity <b>114</b> (not shown) underlies the annular sealing surface <b>118</b> and overlies the annular sealing surface <b>110</b>, but does not underlie the flange <b>108</b>. For example, a section line bisecting the cavity <b>114</b> along a radius does not bisect the flange <b>108</b>. In another example, the flange <b>108</b> at least partially traverses and end of the cavity <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The seal body <b>106</b> also may include an annular ridge <b>120</b> extending radially inwardly from the annular sealing surface <b>110</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, ridges and edges are illustrated in a precompressed form to illustrate the form of the seal body prior to distortion by compression between the rod <b>116</b> and the housing <b>104</b>. The annular ridge <b>120</b> may form a shape, such as a sharp ridge, a square ridge, or a rounded ridge. In addition, the seal body <b>106</b> may include two, three, or more annular ridges extending or protruding radially inwardly from the annular sealing surface <b>110</b>. Further, the annular ridge <b>120</b> may have a peak that is located under the opening <b>130</b> or the cavity <b>114</b> when viewed along a radial vector (not shown). In a particular example, the peak of the annular ridge <b>120</b> is axially spaced apart from a center point (<b>124</b> or <b>126</b>) of at least one of the first and second annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. For example, the peak of the annular ridge <b>120</b> may have location axially closer to the opening than radial bisecting lines C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> extending through the spring center points <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, respectively. In a further example, the seal body <b>106</b> may include a second annular ridge <b>122</b> extending radially outwardly from the second annular sealing surface <b>118</b>. Here too, the annular ridge <b>122</b> may form a shape, such as a sharp edge, a squared edge, or a rounded edge. As with the annular ridge <b>120</b>, the annular ridge <b>122</b> may have a peak located at a different axial location than lines C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> bisecting one of the center points, <b>124</b> or <b>126</b>, of each of the annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. The seal body <b>106</b> may also include additional annular ridges extending or protruding radially from the annular surface <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular applications, such as high-pressure liquid chromatography, the rod <b>116</b> may be formed of sapphire. The seal body <b>106</b> may be formed of a composite material including a fluoropolymer, an aromatic polymer and graphite fiber. In an exemplary embodiment, the composite material includes a polymer matrix of fluoropolymer, and in particular, a fluoropolymer that exhibits a low coefficient of friction. An exemplary fluoropolymer includes a polymer formed from a fluorine substituted olefin monomer or a polymer including at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of vinylidene fluoride, vinylfluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, trifluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and a mixture of such fluorinated monomers. An exemplary fluoropolymer may include a polymer, a polymer blend or a copolymer including one or more of the above monomers, such as, for example, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), ethylene-tretrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene-perfluoropropylvinylether (PFA), poly tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoromethylvinylether (MFA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), or tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene-vinylidene fluoride (THV). In particular, the fluoropolymer may be polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), such as a modified PTFE. In an example, the modified PTFE is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and a vinyl ether, such as perfluoropropylvinylether (PPVE). In an embodiment, the modified PTFE includes at least about 0.01 wt % perfluoropropylvinylether (PPVE). In another example, the modified PTFE includes not greater than about 5.0 wt % PPVE, such as not greater than about 3.0 wt %, or not greater than about 1.5 wt % PPVE. While particular embodiments of modified PTFE that include PPVE are melt processable, a particularly useful modified PTFE includes a small amount of PPVE such that the modified PTFE is not melt processable and instead is typically solution deposited and sintered. Particular examples of modified PTFE are commercially available, such as TFM1700 available from Dyneon, Teflon&#xae; NXT available from DuPont&#xae;, and M1-11 available from Daikon.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The material may include at least about 80.0 wt % fluoropolymer. For example, the material may include about 80.0 wt % to about 95.0 wt % fluoropolymer, such as about 85.0 wt % to about 91.0 wt % fluoropolymer. In a particular example, the material includes about 80.0 wt % to about 95.0 wt % modified PTFE, such as about 85.0 wt % to about 91.0 wt % of the modified PTFE.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an exemplary embodiment, the material includes an aromatic polymer. For example, the aromatic polymer may include phenyl polymer, such as polyphenylenesulfide or polyphenyleneoxide. In a particular example, the aromatic polymer includes polyphenylenesulfide. The material may include about 1.0 wt % to about 10.0 wt % of the aromatic polymer. For example, the material may include about 3.0 wt % to about 7.0 wt % of the aromatic polymer. In a particular example, the composite material includes about 1.0 wt % to about 10.0 wt %, such as about 3.0 wt % to about 7.0 wt % polyphenylenesulfide.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the composite material includes graphite fiber. Graphite fiber is differentiated from traditional carbon fibers by crystalline structure and is differentiated from traditional graphite by form. Typically, carbon fibers are formed from organic polymers, such as polyacrylonitrile, or are formed from pitch. The organic fibers are generally treated through oxidation in air at between about 200&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C. to form non-meltable precursor fibers. Such precursor fibers are heated in a nitrogen environment at about 1000&#xb0; C. to about 2500&#xb0; C. to form carbon fibers. Often such carbon fibers include at least about 92.0 wt % carbon. In an exemplary embodiment, graphite fibers may be formed by heating such carbon fibers at between about 2500&#xb0; C. to about 3000&#xb0; C., resulting in the distinct crystalline structure of graphite while maintaining a fiber form. As a result, carbon fibers are differentiable from graphite fibers by observing crystalline structure, such as through x-ray diffraction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect to graphite, graphite is typically particulate in form and thus is different from the graphite fibers of the disclosed composite material. Particulate graphite is often formed by crushing mineral graphite or through heating of petroleum products at about 2800&#xb0; C. Such processes produce graphite particulate that is different in both form and mechanical properties from the graphite fibers formed through methods, such as the exemplary method disclosed above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, the composite material includes about 1.0 wt % to about 10.0 wt % of the graphite fiber. For example, the material may include about 3.0 wt % to about 7.0 wt % of the graphite fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> may each be a single coil spring or a double coil spring. Depending on the application, the annular springs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> may be formed of corrosion-resistant metal, such as stainless steel. In particular, the annular springs may be formed of a stainless steal, such as a 304 stainless steel. Alternatively, the annular springs may be formed of a flexible metal or a polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> illustrate alternative embodiments of the annular seal.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Seals of the design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are formed of 90.0 wt % modified PTFE, 5.0 wt % polyphenylenesulfide, and 5.0 wt % graphite fiber. The seals are rated based on the total time to failure in the presence of one of three fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The seals are tested in a Shimadzu LC10ATvp high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump. The pump is designed with two heads that operate in a series. One seal is installed in each head. The seal is installed over a sapphire rod and the pump head is secured to the main pump body. The sapphire rod operates in a reciprocating linear motion to produce a pumping action. A new sapphire rod is used for each test.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The pump operates at a pressure of 20 MPa (2900 psi) and a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The seals are tested for leakage in the presence of one of three fluids: de-ionized water, methanol, or a blend of 30% 0.1 M phosphoric buffer solution and 70% methanol.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Pump head seal leakage is evaluated by forcing air through a tube or port on the top side of the pump head housing. Leakage is indicated by placing a collection tissue at the bottom base of the pump head. When seal leakage occurs, the action of the forced air down the backside pump head expels moisture down on to the collection tissue. When wetness is observed, a leakage failure is declared.</p>
