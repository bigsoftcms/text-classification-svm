<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of DE 10 2005 011 321.4, filed Mar. 11, 2005, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a drive unit for a motor vehicle having an engine unit and an axle differential arranged on the latter, as well as having drive shafts for vehicle wheels disposed at least partially in the crankcase.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE 33 23 626 C2 shows a drive unit in which the drive shaft penetrating an oil pan of the internal-combustion engine is disposed in the crankcase on one side and on or in the oil pan on the other side. This arrangement permits a compact construction of the drive unit so that, when there is sufficient ground clearance, a lifting of the vehicle body is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention to further improve the structural rigidity of such a drive unit for absorbing the dynamic forces in the case of a simultaneously deep installation position of the engine unit in the vehicle, so that a flat overall frontal geometry can be achieved with a low center of gravity of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object has been achieved by providing that a separating plane between the crankcase bottom part and the oil bearing housing of the crankcase is provided as the bearing for at least one drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result of the fact that the separating plane between a crankcase bottom half and an oil bearing housing of the engine unit is provided as a bearing plane for the drive shaft, on the one hand, the weight of the engine unit or of the drive unit as well as the dynamic forces occurring during the operation can be reliably absorbed and, on the other hand, because of the installation position for the drive shaft, a deep installation position can be achieved for the engine unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The differential gear or axle differential has a housing which is simultaneously provided as a fastening point or bearing point for the engine at the vehicle member or the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One of the two drive shafts is additionally supported on the side of the crankcase opposite the axle differential by a bearing console screwed to the crankcase. This advantageously increases the stiffness of the bearing unit for the drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a V-8 engine having a crankcase <b>2</b> which essentially consists of a crankcase top half <b>4</b>, a crankcase bottom half <b>6</b> and an adjoining oil bearing housing <b>8</b>. An oil collecting space <b>9</b> is constructed in the oil bearing housing <b>8</b> and is closed off toward the bottom by an oil pan cover <b>8</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the cylinder faces are integrated in the crankcase top part <b>4</b>. The respective main bearing halves for the crankshaft <b>10</b> are integrated in the separating plane between the crankcase top half and bottom half <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>. An inner and outer screwed main bearing connection <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is provided for screwing the crankcase bottom half <b>6</b> to the crankcase top half <b>4</b>. The outer screwed main bearing connection <b>14</b>&#x2014;as illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>&#x2014;is adjoined by oil return ducts <b>16</b> toward the outside for returning the lubricating oil from the cylinder head into the oil sump constructed in the oil bearing housing <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Two drive shafts <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>of a front-axle drive <b>20</b> extend in the separating plane (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) between the crankcase bottom half <b>6</b> and the oil bearing housing <b>8</b>. The drive shaft <b>18</b><i>b </i>on the right, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is disposed completely in the parting plane E between the crankcase bottom part <b>6</b> and the oil bearing housing <b>8</b>. The left drive shaft <b>18</b><i>a </i>is disposed in a housing <b>22</b> of an axle differential <b>24</b> which is fastened laterally to the oil bearing housing <b>8</b> and the crankcase bottom half <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the fastening flange B for the housing <b>22</b> of the axial differential <b>24</b> which is of semicircular construction in each case on the crankcase bottom half <b>6</b> and on the oil bearing housing <b>8</b>. The right drive shaft <b>18</b><i>b </i>is guided through the opening <b>25</b>. One flange <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is constructed at the two outer ends of the drive shafts <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>, on which flanges <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, propeller shafts <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>are fastened which lead to the vehicle wheels. An axle shaft gearwheel <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, respectively is fastened at the other ends of the drive shafts <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>, to mesh two differential bevel gears (not shown), disposed on an axle bolt <b>34</b> constructed in one or several parts. Furthermore, the ring gear <b>36</b> is received in the housing <b>22</b> of the axle differential <b>24</b> and is driven in a known manner by way of a bevel drive pinion (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A bearing consol <b>38</b> is provided on the side of the crankcase <b>2</b> situated opposite the axle differential <b>24</b> for the bearing of the right drive shaft <b>18</b><i>b </i>and is fastened to the crankcase bottom part <b>6</b> and top half <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, a first fastening flange <b>40</b> is shaped in one piece out of the housing <b>22</b> of the axle differential <b>24</b>. The first fastening flange <b>40</b> is used for fastening the engine unit <b>2</b> to the chassis or body of the motor vehicle. On the opposite side, a second fastening flange <b>43</b> is provided on the bearing console and is used as a second bearing point for the fastening of the crankcase <b>2</b>. Here, for example, the engine unit is linked to the chassis or the vehicle body by corresponding hydraulic bearings or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the motor vehicle equipped with the engine unit <b>2</b> is constructed as an all-wheel drive vehicle. For this purpose, the housing <b>22</b> of the axle differential <b>24</b> has a connection flange <b>41</b> in which a shaft is received <b>42</b> with the bevel drive pinion for the ring gear <b>36</b>, while the other end of the shaft <b>42</b> leads to the transfer case.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing disclosure has been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting. Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
