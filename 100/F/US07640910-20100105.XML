<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The field covers the combination of an opposed-piston engine with a hypocycloidal drive. In addition, the field covers the use of a piston coupled to a hypocycloidal drive to generate electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The opposed piston internal-combustion engine was invented by Hugo Junkers around the end of the nineteenth century. In Junkers' basic configuration, two pistons are disposed crown-to-crown in a common cylinder having inlet and exhaust ports near bottom dead center of each piston, with the pistons serving as the valves for the ports. The engine has two crankshafts, each disposed at a respective end of the cylinder. The crankshafts are linked by rods to respective pistons and are geared together to control phasing of the ports and to provide engine output. The advantages of Junkers' opposed piston engine over traditional two-cycle and four-cycle engines include superior scavenging, reduced parts count and increased reliability, high thermal efficiency and high power density.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Nevertheless, Junkers' basic design contains a number of deficiencies among which is excessive friction between the pistons and cylinder bore caused by side forces exerted on the pistons. Each piston is coupled by an associated connecting rod to one of the crankshafts. Each connecting rod is connected at one end to a piston by a wristpin internal to the piston; at the other end, the connecting rod engages a crankpin on a crankshaft. The connecting rod pivots on the wristpin in order to accommodate circular motion of the crank pin. As the connecting rod pushes the piston inwardly in the cylinder, it exerts a compressive force on the piston at an angle to the axis of the piston, which produces a radially-directed force (a side force) between the piston and cylinder bore. This side force increases piston/cylinder friction, raising the piston temperature and thereby limiting the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) achievable by the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An engine coupling invented by Mathew Murray in 1802 converted the linear motion of a steam engine piston and rod into rotary motion to drive a crankshaft by a &#x201c;hypocycloidal&#x201d; gear train coupling the rod to the crankshaft. A hypocycloid is a special plane curve generated by the trace of a fixed point on a small circle that rolls within a larger circle. In Murray's gear train, the larger circle is the &#x201c;pitch circle&#x201d; of a ring gear with teeth on an inner annulus and the small circle is the pitch circle of a spur gear with teeth on an outer annulus. (See the definition of &#x201c;pitch circle&#x201d; in American National Standard publication ANSI/AGMA 1012-G05 at 4.5.3.1.1, page 10). The spur gear is disposed within the ring gear, with its teeth meshed with the teeth of the ring gear. As the spur gear rotates, it travels an orbit on the inner annulus of the ring gear. Murray's gear train represents a special hypocycloid in which the pitch diameter (D) of the ring gear's pitch circle is twice the pitch diameter (d) of the spur gear's pitch circle. When D=2d, a point on the spur gear pitch circle moves in a straight line along a corresponding pitch diameter of the ring gear as the spur gear orbits within the ring gear. Murray connected one such point to a piston rod; the linear motion of the piston rod caused the spur gear to revolve within the ring gear, and the gear train converted the piston's linear motion to rotary motion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Cycloidal gear arrangements have been used in numerous internal combustion engine configurations, including opposed piston engines. See U.S. Pat. No. 2,199,625, for example. In the engine disclosed in the '625 patent, opposed pistons are coupled to cycloid crank drives by means of connecting rods. However, the '625 patent omits two critical insights in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">First, the plane curve traced by the spur gear is not linear in any embodiment taught in the '625 patent: thus, connecting rod motion is not linear. In fact, each connecting rod conventionally engages a wristpin internal to a piston, which allows the connecting rod to pivot with respect to the axis of the piston in order to accommodate the non-linear plane curves traced by the spur gear. Consequently, as the connecting rod pivots on a return stroke while moving a piston into a cylinder, it imposes side forces on the piston, which causes friction between the piston and cylinder bore.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, an unrealized advantage of coupling the pistons of an opposed piston engine to hypocycloidal drives in which the ratio between the pitch diameters of the ring and spur gears is 2:1 is that the pistons, and their connecting rods, undergo purely linear movement along a common axis, thereby eliminating radially-directed side forces that cause friction between the pistons and the bore of the cylinder in which they are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The '625 patent does indicate that grafting a hypocycloidal output to an opposed piston engine construction can add a dimension of flexibility to engine design and operation. For example, the ratio between the pitch diameters is varied to accommodate piston strokes of varying length, which, according to the patent, can be tailored to improve scavenging and piston cooling. However, the '625 patent omits the case where D=2d, in which the linear motion of the spur gear is sinusoidal. The '625 patent therefore lacks a second critical insight: the sinusoidal characteristic of the resulting linear motion can support useful adaptations of a hypocycloidally-coupled engine to produce a desirable sinusoidal output. For example, an internal-combustion engine may be adapted to generate AC electrical power by mounting a coil to the skirt of a piston and coupling the piston to a hypocycloidal drive in which D=2d. The action of the hypocycloidal drive imposes a sinusoidal period on the straight linear motion of the piston. As the piston transports the coil though a magnetic field, a sinusoidal voltage is induced in the windings of the coil.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A hypocycloidal drive includes a pair of spaced-apart ring gears with equal pitch diameters D, a pair of pinions with equal pitch diameters d, wherein D=2d, each pinion engaging a respective ring gear, a journal mounted between the pinions such that the journal axis coincides with the pitch diameters of the pinions, and a respective journal rotatably mounted to an outside of each pinion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An opposed piston, internal-combustion engine is provided with a hypocycloidal drive to convert the linear motion of the pistons and associated connecting rods to rotary output motion. More specifically, in an engine including a cylinder with a bore and opposed pistons disposed within the bore, each connecting rod is coupled to a journal of the hypocycloidal drive.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A hypocycloidal drive illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> translates reciprocating linear motion along a line <b>102</b> into rotary motion on an axis <b>103</b>. The drive <b>100</b> includes spaced-apart ring gears <b>110</b> and coaxially-aligned, spaced-apart spur gears (hereinafter, &#x201c;pinions&#x201d;) <b>120</b>. The ring gears are fixed and share the axis <b>103</b>. Each ring gear <b>110</b> has gear teeth <b>112</b> on an inside annulus, and each pinion <b>120</b> has gear teeth <b>122</b> on an outside annulus. The pinions <b>120</b> are disposed within the ring gears <b>110</b> such that the gear teeth <b>122</b> of each pinion <b>120</b> are engaged with the gear teeth <b>112</b> of a respective ring gear <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Conventional means (not shown) are used to maintain each pinion <b>120</b> for rotation on the inside annulus of a ring gear <b>110</b> so that, as the pinion rotates, it is constrained to travel a circular path along the inside annulus. Such means may comprise a frame holding a ring gear <b>110</b> and retaining a first disc concentrically with the ring gear in a bearing that permits the disc to rotate in a plane parallel to a plane in which the ring gear <b>110</b> is supported. A pinion <b>120</b> is mounted to a second disc, smaller than the first disc that is, in turn, rotationally supported by a bearing in an aperture of the first disc. The pinion <b>120</b> orbits along the gear teeth <b>112</b>, rotating freely on the bearing supporting the second disc. The first disc rotates in response to movement of the pinion <b>120</b>, and retains the pinion <b>120</b> against the gear teeth <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the ring gears and pinions has a respective pitch diameter. Preferably, the pitch diameters (D) of the ring gears are equal; the pitch diameters (d) of the pinions are equal; and, D=2d. Thus, any point on a pinion's pitch circle will follow a straight line of motion as the pinion <b>120</b> rotates around the inside annulus of a ring gear <b>110</b>. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pinions <b>120</b> are disposed concentrically. Thus, when the pinions <b>120</b> rotate at the same speed they maintain concentricity as they move. A line joining corresponding points on the pinion pitch circles that moves in a plane also containing the linear motion of a piston (not shown) establishes an axis of rotation for a journal coupled to a connecting rod running between the piston and the journal. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a journal <b>130</b> is disposed coaxially with such an axis of rotation. When supported in a bearing of a connecting rod moving along the path <b>102</b>, the journal <b>130</b> rotates as moves, and the rotation of the journal <b>130</b> is imparted to the pinions <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary construction for mounting the journal <b>130</b> to the pinions <b>120</b>; this construction is not intended to exclude equivalent constructions that make the journal axis coincident with the pitch diameters of the pinions that lie in the plane containing the linear path <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each pinion <b>120</b> has a first side that faces inwardly, toward the first side of the other pinion, and a second side that faces outwardly, away from the other pinion <b>120</b>. An eccentric member <b>140</b> is mounted to each pinion <b>120</b>. Each eccentric member <b>140</b> has a first end <b>141</b> and a second end <b>142</b>. The first end <b>141</b> is coaxial with and fixed to the inside of the pinion <b>120</b>; the second end <b>142</b> is fixed to the journal <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, output rotary motion is provided by the hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> by eccentric members <b>150</b> rotatably mounted to the pinions <b>120</b>. Each eccentric member <b>150</b> has a first end <b>151</b> and a second end <b>152</b>. The first end <b>151</b> of each eccentric <b>150</b> is mounted to a pinion <b>120</b> to rotate on the axis thereof; a rotatable connection between the first end <b>151</b> and pinion <b>120</b> may be by means of a journal and a bearing (neither seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A journal <b>153</b> is fixed to the second end <b>152</b> of each eccentric member <b>150</b>. The journals <b>153</b> are coaxial with the common axis <b>103</b> of the ring gears <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> operates in response to reciprocating piston motion coupled by a connecting rod (not shown) moving linearly along the line <b>102</b> by translating that linear movement to rotary output movement on the axis <b>103</b>. The movement of the connecting rod along the line <b>102</b> causes the journal <b>130</b> to move back and forth along the same line <b>102</b>, rotating on its axis as it travels. The movement of the journal <b>130</b> is coupled by the eccentric members <b>140</b> to the pinions <b>120</b>, causing the pinions to rotate in the same direction, on a common axis. As the pinions rotate, they orbit on parallel, concentric circular paths defined by the radial separation of their common axis from the axis <b>103</b>. The orbit of each pinion axis is coupled by an eccentric member <b>150</b> to a journal <b>153</b>, and the journals <b>153</b> rotate on the axis <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A module of an opposed piston internal-combustion engine <b>200</b> with hypocycloidal drives is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>. The module represents the basic unit of an engine, with the understanding that the illustrated unit would be connected by appropriate means to engine control, air, fuel and coolant systems. The unit may also be supported with other identical units in a multi-cylinder engine. The engine <b>200</b> includes a cylinder <b>214</b> in which two pistons <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> are disposed. Examples of construction and operation of cylinders and pistons which may be incorporated into the engine <b>200</b> may be found in publication WO 2005/124124 A1, which is incorporated herein by reference. One or more fuel injectors FI mounted to the cylinder <b>214</b> inject fuel, typically diesel fuel, into the cylinder, between the crowns of the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pistons <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> are disposed crown-to-crown in the bore of the cylinder <b>214</b> in opposing axial alignment, and reciprocate toward and away from each other as the engine <b>200</b> operates. Each of the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> has a skirt <b>217</b> and a crown <b>218</b>. The structure of the cylinder <b>214</b> includes exhaust and intake ports E, I. Air introduced through port I is compressed as the pistons move together. Then, fuel injected into the compressed air ignites, driving the pistons apart. Exhaust gases exit the cylinder through port E. Each piston moves in a reciprocating straight line motion within the bore of the cylinder <b>214</b> during each operating cycle of the engine <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the pistons <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> have moved away from each other, and are traversing their respective bottom dead center positions; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the pistons have moved toward each other, while traversing through their respective top dead center positions. The operational cycle of an opposed piston engine is described in publication WO 2005/124124 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the engine <b>200</b> includes hypocycloidal drives near respective ends of the cylinder <b>214</b>. For example, but without excluding other hypocycloidal constructions, each of the hypocycloidal drives in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> may be constituted as the hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the numbering convention of that example used for ease of explanation and illustration throughout the remainder of the description. Each hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> converts the reciprocating straight line motion of a piston into a rotary output motion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> is coupled to an associated hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> by a connecting rod <b>240</b>. Each connecting rod <b>240</b> is attached at one end to the crown of a piston and is coupled at the opposite end to a journal <b>130</b> of a hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as the example, the end of the connecting rod <b>240</b> nearest a journal <b>130</b> has a support structure <b>242</b> mounted thereto. A bearing <b>243</b> rotatably supports the journal <b>130</b> in the support structure <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, tie rods <b>246</b> hold the engine <b>200</b> together. Each tie rod <b>246</b> has two bearings, one at either end, to receive and support two journals <b>153</b> of two respective hypocycloidal drives <b>100</b> for rotation. Bearing supports <b>247</b> support the ring gears <b>110</b> at fixed locations in the engine <b>200</b>. Both the tie rods <b>246</b> and the bearing supports <b>247</b> are shown mounted to a structural member <b>249</b>, of an engine frame, for example. The hypocycloidal drives <b>100</b> represent modular portions of respective crankshafts, each disposed at a respective end of the cylinder <b>214</b>. Such crankshafts may be supported for rotation relative to each other in either direction. Each journal <b>130</b> of a hypocycloidal drive also functions as a crankpin for a respective one of the crankshafts, and the journals <b>153</b> correspond to the central shaft of a crankshaft from which output rotary motion of the engine <b>200</b> is captured by interconnecting gears between the crankshafts. These interconnecting gears are not seen in the figures, but may be understood by reference to the example shown in publication WO 2005/124124 A1, referenced above. If the pitch diameters specified above (D=2d) for the ring and pinion gears are utilized, the reciprocating straight-line motion of each of the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> is translated, by a hypocycloid drive <b>100</b> coupled to the piston, into rotary motion of a respective crankshaft in which the crankshaft rotates 360&#xb0; for every complete operational cycle of the piston. With D=2d, the connecting rods <b>240</b> undergo purely linear motion, no side forces are generated, and wristpins internal to the pistons may be omitted in the construction of the engine <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As can further be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, channels <b>241</b> inside the connecting rods <b>240</b> may be provided to deliver liquid coolant, as needed, to back surfaces of the piston crowns <b>218</b>. The channels <b>241</b> may communicate with liquid lines through elements (not shown) of the hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> where fluid, for example diesel fuel under pressure, may be injected. Liquid coolant may be applied to the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> and to the cylinder <b>214</b> in the manner taught in PCT patent publication WO 2005/124124 A1. Liquid coolant may also be applied to the pistons <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> as disclosed below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a generator apparatus <b>400</b> for converting mechanical to electrical energy includes a two-cycle, opposed piston internal-combustion engine with hypocycloidal drives. For example, but without excluding other hypocycloidal structures and/or opposed piston structures, each of the hypocycloidal drives and the engine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be constituted as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b> and the numbering convention of those examples will be used for ease of explanation and illustration throughout the remainder of the description. Thus, the generator apparatus <b>400</b> may be constituted of an engine <b>200</b> with hypocycloidal drives <b>100</b> in which D=2d, with the engine adapted, as to be described, for generating electricity. The engine <b>200</b> includes one or more cylinders, including the cylinder <b>214</b>. Two opposed pistons (not seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are disposed for reciprocal motion in the bore of the cylinder <b>214</b>. A hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> is coupled to each of the pistons disposed in the cylinder <b>214</b>. Piston rods <b>240</b> couple the pistons to the hypocycloidal drives <b>100</b>. The generator apparatus <b>400</b> may include at least one generator for converting the motion of a piston into electricity. For example, the generator apparatus <b>400</b> includes two generators <b>420</b>, each associated with a respective piston, and each located at a respective end of the cylinder <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side perspective view of the right hand side of the generator apparatus <b>400</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross section of that side. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the right hand side includes one piston <b>216</b>, with the understanding that the salient features of the piston <b>216</b> and associated structures may also be included in the construction of the left hand side of the generator apparatus <b>400</b>, which is not seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the generator <b>420</b> associated with the piston <b>216</b> includes a magnetic circuit including a permanent magnet <b>421</b>, a cylindrical piece <b>422</b> with a flange <b>423</b>, and an annular disc <b>424</b>. The cylindrical piece <b>422</b> and the annular disc <b>424</b> are made of magnetically conductive material such as cold rolled steel. The annular disc <b>424</b> is fixed to the cylinder <b>214</b> by attachment to a flange <b>219</b> formed on the end of the cylinder <b>214</b>, and the magnet <b>421</b> is held between the annular disc <b>424</b> and the flange <b>423</b>. The elements of the magnetic circuit may be bonded together. Since side forces causing friction between the pistons and the bore of the cylinder are eliminated by hypocycloidal coupling in which D=2d, piston construction can incorporate light, nonmagnetic materials. For example, the skirt <b>217</b> of the piston <b>216</b> may be made of a boron fiber, Kevlar, or other suitable or equivalent composite material, and the outer surface of the skirt <b>217</b> may be coated with a diamond-like material for hardness and durability. The generator <b>420</b> includes a coil <b>425</b> of conductive wire, preferably copper wire, disposed on the inside surface of the skirt <b>217</b>. An air gap <b>426</b> suitable to accommodate the aggregate thickness of the coil <b>425</b> and piston skirt <b>217</b> is provided between the annular disc <b>424</b> and the upper end <b>427</b> of the cylindrical piece <b>421</b>. One of the connecting rods <b>240</b> is attached at one end to the crown <b>218</b> of the piston <b>216</b> and at the opposite end to the journal <b>130</b> of a hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> by means of a support structure <b>242</b>&#x2032;. The support structure <b>242</b>&#x2032; includes a bearing <b>243</b>&#x2032; that receives and supports the journal <b>130</b> for rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the piston <b>216</b> reciprocates within the cylinder <b>214</b> of the opposed piston engine <b>200</b>, the skirt <b>217</b> moves through a magnetic field created by the permanent magnet <b>421</b>. During this reciprocating action of the skirt <b>217</b>, the coil <b>425</b> continuously traverses the magnetic field, which induces a voltage in the windings of the coil <b>425</b>. The voltage (&#x201c;E&#x201d;) created by the coil <b>425</b> is a function of the strength of the magnetic field (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) times the length of the wire wound on the coil <b>425</b> (&#x201c;I&#x201d;) actually in the magnetic field times the velocity of the coil passing through the magnetic field (&#x201c;v&#x201d;) and is expressed as E=Blv. Conventional wire forming processes can yield a large value for &#x201c;I&#x201d; in a relatively short coil.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the pitch diameters of the ring gears and pinions of the hypocycloidal drives <b>100</b> are constrained by D=2d, each hypocycloidal drive <b>100</b> will impose a sinusoidal characteristic on the reciprocal straight line motion of a piston. This is especially advantageous in the generator apparatus <b>400</b> because the sinusoidal characteristic will be imposed on the voltage generated by the reciprocating coil <b>425</b> as it is carried by the piston <b>216</b> through the magnetic field. In conventional rotating generators, hysteresis and eddy current losses are caused by the constant variation of the magnetic flux as the armature core rotates through the polarized fields. These losses are minimal, if not absent, in the generator <b>420</b> because the flux is relatively constant within the magnetic circuit. Furthermore, with a sinusoidal linear motion generating a corresponding sinusoidal voltage there is no need for inverters to generate alternating voltage outputs. In addition, a purely (or nearly pure) sinusoidal characteristic may be achieved for the linear motion of the pistons and, consequently, the voltage, with addition of one or more suitable flywheels mounted or coupled to the crankshafts. For example, with the engine <b>200</b> operating at 3600 RPM, and variations in the rotational speed of the crankshafts eliminated by one or more flywheels, each of the generators <b>420</b> can produce pure sinusoidal <b>120</b> VAC. An ancillary coil, not shown, may be mounted within the magnetic circuit to provide regulation of the voltage produced by the generator <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As can further be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the channel <b>241</b> inside the connecting rod <b>240</b> communicates with a channel <b>248</b> in the support structure <b>242</b>&#x2032;. A piston cooling liquid line <b>250</b> attached to the support structure <b>242</b>&#x2032; in communication with the channel <b>248</b> has a reciprocating sliding engagement with a stationary coolant supply pipe <b>252</b> where liquid coolant, for example diesel fuel, under pressure is injected as needed to cool back surfaces of the piston crown <b>218</b>. As the engine <b>200</b> operates, the coolant effluent from the inside surface of the crown <b>218</b> flows along the inside surface of the skirt <b>217</b>, cooling the coil, and exits through the channel <b>251</b> formed by the cylindrical piece <b>422</b>. A drain hole <b>428</b> through the flange <b>423</b> allows coolant to drain from the cylindrical space between the cylindrical piece <b>422</b> and the permanent magnet <b>421</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the line <b>250</b> moving within the piston coolant liquid line <b>252</b>, a preferred embodiment would have the line <b>250</b> moving outside the piston coolant supply pipe <b>252</b> to reduce liquid leakage along the outer surface of the extension of the line <b>250</b>. A second channel <b>244</b> within the connecting rod <b>240</b> brings conductors from the voltage generating coil <b>425</b> to make contact with a pair of fixed brushes (not shown) within a pair of housings <b>245</b> to provide an output source for the generated voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an alternate apparatus for generating electrical energy may include conventional alternators <b>500</b> coupled to journals <b>153</b> with a light timing belt to maintain synchrony between the two pistons while electrical power is provided by the alternators <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although novel principles have been set forth with reference to specific embodiments described hereinabove, it should be understood that modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of these principles. For example, the opposed pistons described above may be coupled to a hypocycloidal drive constituted of a single ring gear engaged by a single pinion, with D=2d, like Murray's gear train. Thus, the scope of patent protection for an opposed piston internal-combustion engine with a hypocycloidal drive, or for a generator apparatus incorporating such an engine, is limited only by the following claims.</p>
