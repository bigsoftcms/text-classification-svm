<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an engine that uses high-density hydrocarbon fuel to lubricate its bearings, and more particularly to an engine that has a lubricant mixed with its fuel for bearing lubrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some engines utilise a high-density hydrocarbon propellant fuel that typically comprises exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene. The engines that use such fuel are typically of the miniature gas turbine or turbojet type with approximately 150 lb-f thrust or less. They generally power airborne vehicles of the single use or expendable type, such as reconnaissance drones, cruise missiles, decoys and other weaponry, including air-launched and ground-launched weapon systems. Such engines provide greatly extended range compared to conventional solid fuel rocket engines in such vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Military Standard MIL-P-87107 describes such a high-density hydrocarbon fuel for gas turbine and turbojet engines. A common name known in the industry and military fuel depots for this fuel is JP-10. JP-10 is becoming predominant in the military for missile and aircraft applications due to its favourable properties, which include high density and chemical stability, thereby providing extended vehicle flight range as well as long-term storage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is advantageous to use the fuel as a lubricant for the engine in such expendable vehicles because it eliminates the cost and weight of an independent lubrication supply system. However, JP-10 as generally manufactured is a poor lubricant for bearings in the miniature gas turbine engines that are used in such expendable vehicles. A fuel additive known as tricresyl phosphate (TCP) added to JP-10 may make JP-10 suitable as a lubricant for miniature gas turbine engine bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is convenient for the manufacturer of expendable vehicles to add TCP to JP-10 when expendable vehicles when the manufacturer fuels the vehicles at the factory. However, since the military and prime contract customers use JP-10 fuel for numerous applications, it is logistically more practical for military and prime contractor end users to use a single storage tank of pure JP-10. In addition, end users are reluctant to mix TCP with JP-10 for unique applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, the invention comprises a fuel delivery system for an engine that lubricates its bearings with fuel, comprising: a tank for storing the fuel; a pump for delivering fuel from the tank to the engine bearings; a pressurised container for storing fuel lubrication additive under pressure; and a flow valve for controlling flow of fuel lubrication additive that flows from the pressurised container to mix with the fuel delivered to the engine bearings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of an airborne vehicle <b>2</b> that is suitable for incorporating the invention. The vehicle <b>2</b> comprises an airframe <b>4</b> with one or more aerodynamic surfaces <b>6</b>. The vehicle <b>2</b> also comprises a propulsion engine <b>8</b>, typically of the gas turbine or turbojet type. The engine <b>8</b> mounts within or to the vehicle <b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for purposes of illustration the engine <b>8</b> mounts within the vehicle <b>2</b>, as shown in dashed line. An intake <b>10</b>, shown in dashed line, supplies ambient air to the engine <b>8</b>. An exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, shown in dashed line, exhausts the thrust of the engine <b>8</b> to propel the vehicle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a prior art fuel delivery system <b>14</b>, shown in dashed line, for the engine <b>8</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fuel delivery system <b>14</b> comprises a fuel tank <b>16</b> that stores fuel for the engine <b>8</b>, such as JP-10. The fuel delivery system <b>14</b> also comprises a fuel pump <b>18</b> that transfers the fuel from the tank <b>16</b> by way of a tank outlet line <b>20</b> to a combustor inlet line <b>22</b> that supplies a combustor (not shown) for the engine <b>8</b> and to a bearing lubrication inlet line <b>24</b> that supplies bearings (not shown) for the engine <b>8</b> by way of a pump outlet line <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, the prior art fuel delivery system <b>14</b> is not satisfactory for an engine <b>8</b> when the tank <b>16</b> supplies pure JP-10 fuel, since JP-10 has poor lubrication qualities for the bearings in the engine <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a fuel delivery system <b>28</b>, shown in dashed line, according to a possible embodiment of the invention that shares the components of the prior art fuel delivery system <b>14</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The fuel delivery system <b>28</b> further comprises an independent fuel lubrication additive injection system <b>30</b>, shown in dashed line.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The injection system <b>30</b> comprises a pressurised fuel lubricant additive container <b>32</b>. The container <b>32</b> stores a fuel lubricant additive that is suitable for mixing with the fuel stored in the tank <b>16</b>, such as TCP. One possible way of keeping the container <b>32</b> pressurised is with compressed air developed by the engine <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An engine compressor bleed line <b>34</b> connected to a compressor (not shown) in the engine <b>8</b> supplies high-pressure air through a check valve <b>36</b> and check valve output line <b>38</b> to the container <b>32</b> in order to keep the contents of the container <b>32</b> under pressure. Preferably, an air filter <b>40</b> cleans the air that flows through the bleed line <b>34</b>. Optionally, a pressure relief valve <b>42</b> may control the pressurisation of the container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The injection system <b>30</b> controls release of the fuel lubricant additive in the container <b>32</b> and mixes it into the fuel that flows through the bearing lubrication inlet line <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one possible means for controlling and mixing the fuel lubricant additive with the fuel to provide suitable lubrication for the bearings in the engine <b>8</b>. Fuel lubricant additive from the container <b>32</b> passes through a flow valve <b>44</b>, such as a solenoid operated two-way valve, by way of a container outlet line <b>46</b> into the bearing lubrication inlet line <b>24</b> by way of a valve outlet line <b>48</b> to mix with fuel that supplies lubrication to the engine bearings. Preferably, a filter <b>50</b> filters the fuel lubricant additive before it mixes with the fuel that supplies fuel to the engine bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An electronic controller <b>52</b> may control the operation of the valve <b>44</b> to regulate the flow and mixture of fuel lubrication additive with the fuel that flows through the bearing lubrication inlet line <b>24</b>. The controller <b>52</b> may measure flow rate of fuel that passes through the bearing lubrication inlet line <b>24</b> and generate a control signal representative of the flow rate to modulate the valve <b>44</b> by way of a controller line <b>54</b>, such as with well-known pulse width modulation (PWM) methods, to control the mixture of fuel lubrication additive with fuel that feeds the engine bearings. The controller <b>52</b> may measure the flow directly, or by sensing pressure drop across an orifice <b>56</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, a pulse solenoid or a burst disc and metered orifice may substitute for the valve <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Described above is a fuel lubrication additive injection system for fuel-lubricated gas turbine engines that utilises high-pressure air developed by the engine to transfer stored fuel lubricant additive into the engine fuel stream that lubricates engine bearings. The described embodiment of the invention is only an illustrative implementation of the invention wherein changes and substitutions of the various parts and arrangement thereof are within the scope of the invention as set forth in the attached claims.</p>
