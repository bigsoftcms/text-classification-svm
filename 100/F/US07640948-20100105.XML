<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A machining method for an integrated piping plate, for example, composed of a plurality of plates joined together, and in which an instrument and a component constituting an apparatus, or the instrument, or the component are or is disposed on one surface or both surfaces of the integrated piping plate, and the instrument and the component, or the instrument, or the component are or is connected by fluid channel grooves formed in joining surfaces of the plates, and communication holes formed in the plates. The machining method welds the joining surfaces of the plates around the entire periphery of the fluid channel grooves, for example, by an FSW welding machine, to join the plates. Compared with joining of the plates by an adhesive, the machining method can increase the durability of the plate joining portion and increase pressure resistance. Also, the method can increase work efficiency and further downsize the integrated piping plate.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to an integrated piping plate for use in a fixed unit incorporating piping, wiring, etc. into an apparatus, or a unit integrated so as to be transportable, and a machining method for the integrated piping plate, a machining apparatus for the integrated piping plate, and machining equipment for the integrated piping plate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An integrated piping plate is used as a subsystem for a fixed unit incorporating piping, wiring, etc. into an apparatus, or a transportable integrated unit, and is mainly responsible for controlling the supply, discharge, etc. of a fluid used in the above units.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above units are composed of various instruments, components, piping, wiring, and so on. Large and small piping lines are provided complicatedly everywhere in order that liquids or gases with various properties, temperatures and pressures continuously flow among these instruments, etc. Sensors and control instruments for control of the apparatus are also provided, and many necessary interconnections for them are laid. With devices of which downsizing including weight reduction, in particular, is required, efforts are made to arrange numerous instruments, components, piping, etc. highly densely in a narrow space. An integrated piping plate is applied as means for constructing a fixed unit incorporating piping, wiring, etc. into an apparatus, or a transportable integrated unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A and 50B</figref> show an example of a configurational drawing of a conventional integrated piping plate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A and 50B</figref>, the conventional integrated piping plate is composed of plates <b>521</b>, <b>524</b> having grooves <b>531</b> and communication holes <b>534</b> machined therein, and complicated channels such as the grooves <b>531</b> are formed by casting. The grooves <b>531</b> may be formed by other methods, including cutting with an end mill, a milling machine, or a drilling machine. In a surface of the plate <b>521</b> in contact with the plate <b>524</b>, the grooves <b>531</b> having predetermined sectional areas suitable for the velocities of the corresponding fluids and having suitable directions and lengths corresponding to the locations of the communication holes <b>534</b> are formed as channels connecting instruments <b>525</b> and components <b>525</b><i>a </i>arranged on the plate <b>524</b>. Thus, the instruments <b>525</b> and the components <b>525</b><i>a </i>are brought into communication by the communication holes <b>534</b>. The grooves <b>531</b> and the communication holes <b>534</b> are in charge of the function of piping through which fluids or gases flow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plate <b>521</b> and plate <b>524</b> machined by the above method are joined by an adhesive so as to seal the grooves <b>531</b>. Concretely, joining surfaces of the plates <b>521</b> and <b>524</b> are coated with the adhesive, and then bolts <b>526</b> are screwed into tapped holes <b>528</b> of the plate <b>521</b> through bolt holes <b>527</b> of the plate <b>524</b>. Pressure is imposed on the plates <b>521</b> and <b>524</b> thereby in a direction in which they are joined together. Further, the plates are heated for bonding so that the grooves <b>531</b> are sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The instruments <b>525</b> and components <b>525</b><i>a </i>arranged on the plate <b>524</b> are mounted by screwing bolts (not shown) into tapped holes <b>529</b> of the plate <b>524</b> via a sealing material. These instruments <b>525</b> and components <b>525</b><i>a </i>control the fluid flowing into the grooves <b>531</b> through the communication holes <b>534</b>.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such an integrated piping plate is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 1974-13651.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the above-described conventional integrated piping plate, the plates constituting the integrated piping plate are cast into shape by simple molds, or shaped by cutting. Thus, portions which will give excess weight remain, posing problems about weight reduction and downsizing of the integrated piping plate. In order for the grooves to function as channels for fluids, there is need for the step of performing surface treatment of the groove portions, but this is not a method suitable for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, the adhesive is used for joining of the plates. This results in a low work efficiency, and is not very suitable for mass production. The bolts for fixing of the plates impede the downsizing of the integrated piping plate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The excess wall thickness of the plate is present around the grooves having the function of piping. Thus, even when the fluid flowing through the grooves is to be cooled via the plate, it is difficult to raise the cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition to the above problem, the integrated piping plate according to the present invention constitutes, for example, part of a fuel cell power generation system. Technical requirements for the integrated piping plate are volume production and low cost as in the case of the fuel cell power generation system. Further, downsizing including weight reduction, and a good response in controlling are demanded. Prompt volume production and cost reduction are demanded of the system by the market. There are not a few problems in fulfilling the requirements associated with future demand, such as actual volume production and cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, in view of the above circumstances, the present invention has as an object the provision of an integrated piping plate for apparatuses such as a fuel cell power generation system, the integrated piping plate whose assembly is facilitated by incorporating complicated piping and some components and wiring into the plate, and which is safe and permits downsizing of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is another object of the invention to provide a machining method, a machining apparatus, and machining equipment for an integrated piping plate capable of improving the durability and pressure resistance of a plate joining portion, increasing work efficiency, and achieving further downsizing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention also provides an integrated piping plate and a machining method for it, which can realize volume production and cost reduction, and achieve downsizing including weight reduction.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Details of the configuration of an integrated piping plate according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with a fuel cell power generation system taken as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an integrated piping plate <b>1</b> comprises a plate <b>2</b> and a plate <b>3</b> joined by a suitable adhesive <b>4</b>. The integrated piping plate <b>1</b> is constituted by fixing constituent instruments and components of a fuel cell power generation system (indicated by one-dot chain lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which are disposed on a surface (upper surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b> and include a constituent instrument <b>5</b>, by stud bolts <b>6</b> and nuts <b>7</b> integrally with the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In a joining surface (an upper surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the plate <b>2</b> to be joined to the plate <b>3</b>, grooves <b>8</b> are formed, the grooves <b>8</b> having predetermined sectional area suitable for the velocities of corresponding fluids and having suitable lengths and directions adapted for the positions of piping ports of the constituent instruments and components, such as the instrument <b>5</b> arranged on the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>. The grooves <b>8</b> have the function of piping through which liquids or gases necessary for the fuel cell power generation system flow. Thus, the sectional areas of the grooves <b>8</b> are determined by the properties, flow velocities and pressure losses of flowing fluids, while the lengths and directions of the grooves <b>8</b> are determined by the arrangement of the respective constituent instruments and components, including the instrument <b>5</b>, arranged on the plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the grooves <b>8</b> are provided in the plate <b>2</b>, but the grooves <b>8</b> may be provided in the plate <b>3</b>. That is, the grooves <b>8</b> may be provided in a joining surface (lower surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>3</b> joined to the plate <b>2</b>. The constituent instruments and components of the fuel cell power generation system may be disposed on a surface (lower surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b>, as well as on the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>, although a concrete example will be described later on (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). That is, the constituent instruments and components may be disposed on one of, or both of the surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b> and the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The materials for the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are not restricted, but an aluminum plate and an aluminum alloy plate are the most effective materials for the purpose of decreasing the weight for transportation, and for ease of machining of the grooves <b>8</b>. Castings are also effective because of high resistance to heat and for ease of formation of the grooves <b>8</b>. Moreover, further weight reduction can be achieved by using synthetic resin or the like as the material for the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">According to the present embodiment, the constituent instruments and components, such as the instrument <b>5</b>, are mounted on the plate <b>3</b>, and the stud bolts <b>6</b> are provided for clamping the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to prevent leakage of the fluid flowing through the grooves <b>8</b>. However, this method of fixing is not limitative, and the fixing of the constituent instruments and components onto the plate <b>3</b>, and the fixing of the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> can be performed by through bolts, which pierce through the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or other fixing means.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The plate <b>3</b> is a flat plate with a thickness of a suitable magnitude, and bolt holes <b>9</b> for insertion of the stud bolts <b>6</b> at predetermined positions are bored in the plate thickness direction. Through-holes <b>37</b> for insertion of the stud bolts <b>6</b> are formed in the respective constituent instruments and components, including the instrument <b>5</b>. In the plate <b>3</b>, communication holes <b>10</b> are also disposed for establishing communication between the respective constituent instruments and components, including the instrument <b>5</b>, to be mounted on the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the grooves <b>8</b> of the plate <b>2</b> to permit the flow of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">To assemble such an integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, the first step is to bond the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b> via the adhesive <b>4</b>. Usually, a commercially available thermosetting adhesive is used as the adhesive <b>4</b>, but the method of joining the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> by joining means, such as fusing, brazing or welding, is also effective depending on the type of fuel used for the fuel cell, or the material for the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Then, the stud bolts <b>6</b> are inserted through the bolt holes <b>9</b> of the plate <b>3</b>, and implanted into the plate <b>2</b>. The stud bolts <b>6</b> are inserted through the through-holes <b>37</b> of the instrument <b>5</b>, and then the nuts <b>7</b> are screwed to the end portions of the stud bolts <b>6</b>, whereby the instrument <b>5</b> is fastened to the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. The other constituent instruments and components are also sequentially subjected to the same procedure to complete assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> generally explain the configuration of the integrated piping plate based on its sectional structure. An integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> is assembled, for example, by integrally fixing an A instrument <b>11</b>, a B instrument <b>12</b>, a plate <b>2</b> and a plate <b>3</b> by stud bolts <b>6</b> and nuts <b>7</b> fastened to them.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Between the A instrument <b>11</b> and the B instrument <b>12</b>, a fluid can flow by a groove <b>8</b> formed in the plate <b>2</b> and communication holes <b>10</b> machined in the plate <b>3</b>. That is, the A instrument <b>11</b> and the B instrument <b>12</b> are connected together by the groove <b>8</b>. The plate <b>2</b> and the plat <b>3</b> are adhered by the adhesive <b>4</b>, so that the fluid flowing through the groove <b>8</b> is sealed up. An O ring <b>13</b> or the like is used to seal spacing between the instruments <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example in which instruments are arranged on both surfaces of an integrated piping plate. In an integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, instruments <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are disposed on a surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of a plate <b>3</b>, and instruments <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> are disposed on a surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of a plate <b>2</b>. Grooves <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>8</b>C, which serve as channels for fluids, are formed in a joining surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>2</b>. Communication holes <b>10</b> for communication between these grooves <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>8</b>C and the instruments <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> are formed in the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b>. That is, the instrument <b>105</b> on the plate <b>3</b> and the instrument <b>107</b> on the plate <b>2</b> are connected by the groove <b>8</b>A, the instruments <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> on the plate <b>2</b> are connected by the groove <b>8</b>B, and the instrument <b>106</b> on the plate <b>3</b> and the instrument <b>108</b> on the plate <b>2</b> are connected by the groove <b>8</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">It is also possible to dispose instruments and components only on the surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b>, without providing instruments and components on the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>, although they are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show an example of an integrated piping plate having a corrosion-proof layer formed by surface treatment. In an integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, joining surfaces (adhesion surfaces) <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>of a plate <b>2</b> and a plate <b>3</b>, and the surfaces of a groove <b>8</b> to serve as a channel for a fluid, and communication holes <b>10</b> are coated with or lined with fluorocarbon resin, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, or covered with an aluminum oxide film to form corrosion-proof layers <b>29</b>. By so forming the corrosion-proof layers <b>29</b>, corrosion by the fluid flowing through the groove <b>8</b> and the communication holes <b>10</b>, or by ingredients contained in the adhesive <b>4</b> can be prevented, and a long life of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show an example of welding a plate <b>2</b> and a plate <b>3</b>. As indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, welding is performed on weld lines <b>30</b>, which surround the peripheries of grooves <b>8</b> formed in the plate <b>2</b> while keeping suitable distances from the grooves <b>8</b>, by electromagnetic force-controlled hybrid welding or the like, with the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> being sequentially gripped at a strong pressure. As a result, the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b> are welded at the positions of the weld lines <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At the sites of the weld lines <b>30</b>, the fluids flowing through the grooves <b>8</b> can be sealed up reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a three-dimensional module as an application of the above integrated piping plate. A three-dimensional module <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is formed in a three-dimensional configuration by integrally fixing two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B in the following manner: Through bolts <b>14</b> are inserted through through-holes <b>101</b> piercing through the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B (all of plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), and nuts <b>102</b> are screwed to opposite end portions of the through bolts <b>14</b>, with the back surfaces of the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B being superposed, namely, with a surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b> in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A and a surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b> in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B being superposed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, auxiliary components or auxiliary instruments <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>are disposed on the lower integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B so as to be located behind instruments <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> provided on the upper integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A, whereby the three-dimensional structure is constructed. This makes marked downsizing possible.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, if the instruments or components are arranged on the surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b>, rather than on the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>, it goes without saying that the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b> becomes the back surface of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, and this surface becomes a joining surface to be joined to the other integrated piping plate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are integrated, but this manner is not restrictive. An arbitrary plurality of integrated piping plates, such as three or four integrated piping plates, may be integrated (made three-dimensional), with their back surfaces being superposed.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In a three-dimensional module <b>15</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, a relatively large integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A having instruments <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> disposed thereon is placed on an upper side in the drawing, while relatively small integrated piping plates <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D having instruments <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, instruments <b>115</b>, <b>116</b> and instruments <b>117</b>, <b>118</b> disposed thereon are arranged on a lower side in the drawing. These four integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D are integrally fixed, with back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the four integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D being superposed, whereby the three-dimensional configuration is constituted.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In the case of a three-dimensional module <b>15</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, large and small integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C having instruments <b>119</b>, <b>120</b>, instruments <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, and instruments <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> disposed thereon are placed on an upper side in the drawing, while large and small integrated piping plates <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E having instruments <b>125</b>, <b>126</b>, and instruments <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> disposed thereon are arranged on a lower side in the drawing. These five integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E are integrally fixed, with back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the five integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E being superposed, whereby the three-dimensional configuration is constituted.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of a heat insulating three-dimensional module as an application of the above integrated piping plate. An heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is formed in a three-dimensional configuration by integrally fixing two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B in the following manner: Through bolts <b>17</b> are inserted through through-holes <b>103</b> piercing through the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B (all of plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), and nuts <b>104</b> are screwed to opposite end portions of the through bolts <b>17</b> via heat insulators <b>16</b><i>b</i>'s, with the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B (the surfaces of the plates <b>2</b> in the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B) being superposed, and with a suitable heat insulator <b>16</b><i>a </i>or the like being interposed between these back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In this heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>A, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are bound together via the heat insulators <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Since there are such heat insulating layers, heats of high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>disposed on the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A on the upper side in the drawing can be prevented from being transferred to the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B on the lower side in the drawing. Thus, other low temperature instruments <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>can be disposed on the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B in proximity to the high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>disposed on the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In this case as well, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are not restrictive, but an arbitrary plurality of integrated piping plates can be integrated. For example, a heat insulator may be interposed between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or a heat insulator may be interposed between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, although these modes are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of another heat insulating three-dimensional module as an application of the above integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. An heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is formed in a three-dimensional configuration by integrally connecting and fixing two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B by means of separators <b>31</b> of a suitable length, with the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B (the surfaces of the plates <b>2</b> in the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B) being superposed, and with the separators <b>31</b> being interposed between these back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s. Also, heat insulators <b>130</b> are interposed between the separator <b>31</b> and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In this heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B, a suitable spacing is maintained between the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B by the separators <b>31</b>, whereby a high temperature portion (high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b</i>) and a low temperature portion (low temperature instruments <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>) are thermally shut off from each other, and the apparatus can be downsized in a three-dimensional configuration. Moreover, a heat insulating effect can be further enhanced by interposing the heat insulators <b>130</b> between the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and the separators <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">That is, if a sufficient heat insulating effect is obtained by mere interposition of the separators <b>31</b>, it is not absolutely necessary to provide the heat insulators <b>130</b>. However, if it is necessary to cut off heat transmitted through the separators <b>31</b>, the heat insulators <b>130</b> are interposed between the separators <b>31</b> and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B. Alternatively, the heat insulators <b>130</b> may be provided either between the separators <b>31</b> and the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A or between the separators <b>31</b> and the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In this case as well, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are not restrictive, but an arbitrary plurality of integrated piping plates can be integrated. For example, in the case of a heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a relatively large integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A having high temperature instruments <b>131</b><i>a</i>, <b>131</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>disposed thereon is placed on an upper side in the drawing, while relatively small integrated piping plates <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C having low temperature instruments <b>133</b><i>a</i>, <b>133</b><i>b </i>and low temperature instruments <b>134</b><i>a</i>, <b>134</b><i>b </i>disposed thereon are placed on a lower side in the drawing. The three integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C are formed into a three-dimensional configuration by integrally connecting and fixing these integrated piping plates by separators <b>31</b>, with the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the three integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C being superposed, and with the separators <b>31</b> being interposed between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows an example in which instruments, instead of the separators, are interposed between integrated piping plates. In a three-dimensional module <b>18</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b> are interposed, instead of the separators <b>31</b> in the three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. These instruments <b>139</b> and <b>140</b> may also be connected together by a groove provided in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A or integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B, although this mode is not shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows an example in which components <b>139</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>a</i>, instead of instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b>, are interposed between integrated piping plates.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In this case as well, the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are separated from each other by the instruments <b>139</b> and <b>140</b>, as in the case of interposition of the separators <b>31</b>. Thus, a heat insulating effect can be expected. A marked heat insulating effect is obtained, particularly by interposing heat insulators <b>130</b> between the instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b> and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, as shown in the drawing. In this case, moreover, the spacing between the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B is effectively utilized by arranging the instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b> between the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. Thus, the apparatus can be further downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In this case as well, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are not restrictive, but an arbitrary plurality of integrated piping plates can be integrated. For example, in the heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, constituent instruments or components may be interposed in place of the separators <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example of a plurality of integrated piping plates disposed on the same rest, as an application of the integrated piping plate. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A having high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>disposed thereon, and an integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B having low temperature instruments <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>disposed thereon are disposed on the same rest <b>32</b> with a suitable heat insulating spacing L. Fixing of the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B to the rest <b>32</b> is performed by suitable fixing means, such as bolts or welding (not shown).

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">By so disposing the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B with the heat insulating spacing L maintained, these integrated piping plates <b>1</b> can ignore (prevent) thermal influence from each other. By interposing the heat insulator <b>145</b> between the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and the rest <b>32</b>, a heat insulating effect can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In this case as well, the two integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are not restrictive, but an arbitrary plurality of integrated piping plates can be disposed on the same rest.

<p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show an example in which high temperature instruments and low temperature instruments are disposed on the same integrated piping plate. With an integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, a heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> is provided between a high temperature zone where high temperature instruments or components, such as high temperature instruments <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>, <b>33</b><i>c</i>, are disposed, and a low temperature zone where low temperature instruments or components, such as low temperature instruments <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b</i>, are disposed, on the same integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. The heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> is formed in a plate <b>2</b>, and communication holes <b>36</b> communicating with opposite end portions of the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> are formed in a plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">According to this integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> forms a heat barrier by air, presenting a high resistance to heat conduction from the high temperature zone to the low temperature zone. Thus, even when the low temperature instruments <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>are disposed in proximity to the high temperature instruments <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>, <b>33</b><i>c </i>on the same integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, no thermal influence is exerted.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Filling of a suitable heat insulator into the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> is also effective means for preventing thermal influence.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">To heighten the effect of the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b>, there may be a configuration in which a refrigerant, such as cooling air or cooling water, is flowed into the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> by refrigerant reflux means (not shown) from one of the communication holes <b>36</b> toward the other communication hole <b>36</b> among the communication holes <b>36</b> provided in the opposite end portions of the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> to cool the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">As shown in these drawings, a C instrument <b>22</b> and a D instrument <b>23</b> disposed on the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> are connected by a groove <b>8</b> provided in a plate <b>2</b>. A fluid flowing through the groove <b>8</b> is detected by a pressure sensor <b>25</b><i>a </i>buried in a plate <b>3</b>, detection signals from the pressure sensor <b>25</b><i>a </i>are transferred to the control instrument <b>20</b> embedded in the plate <b>3</b>, and control signals from the control instrument <b>20</b> are transmitted to the electromagnetic valves <b>19</b> buried in the plate <b>3</b> via the electrical wiring <b>21</b> buried in the plate <b>3</b>, thereby actuating the electromagnetic valves <b>19</b>. Similarly, a flow sensor <b>25</b><i>b </i>for detecting the flow rate of the fluid flowing through the groove <b>8</b>, and a temperature sensor <b>25</b><i>c </i>for detecting the temperature of the fluid are also buried in the plate <b>3</b>, and detection signals from these sensors <b>25</b><i>b </i>and <b>25</b><i>c </i>are also taken into the control instrument <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In this manner, the electromagnetic valves <b>19</b>, control instrument <b>20</b> and electrical wiring <b>21</b> are built into the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, whereby a further saving in space can be achieved. Electrical components, such as switches, may also be incorporated into the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. As the control device <b>20</b>, a printed chip (printed circuit board), which can be buried in the plate <b>3</b>, may be used. Some components can be incorporated into the plate <b>2</b>. In this case, the plate <b>3</b> should have an opening for the purpose of assembly, inspection, etc. of the components. That is, the instruments, components, control instrument, or electrical wiring constituting the apparatus may be built into one of or both of the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In the fuel cell power generation system or the like, as stated earlier, fluids flowing the grooves <b>8</b> as channels come in wide varieties of types, such as a high temperature fluid, a low temperature fluid, and a fluid containing a corrosive substance. Of them, the fluid containing a corrosive substance (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;a corrosive fluid&#x201d;) requires extra care for the channels. Thus, as explained based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the surfaces of the grooves <b>8</b> are coated with or lined with fluorocarbon resin, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, or covered with an aluminum oxide film to form a corrosion-proof layer <b>29</b>, thereby making the grooves <b>8</b> corrosion resistant to the corrosive fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">However, this technique for providing the corrosion-proof layer may be difficult to apply, if the arrangement of the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) is complicated. That is, in a unit of the fuel cell power generation system composed of many instruments and components as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, these numerous instruments and components are connected by the grooves <b>8</b>, or small instruments, such as valves, electrical components, such as sensors or switches, and electrical wiring are assembled into the plate. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the number of the grooves <b>8</b> is very large, and some grooves <b>8</b> (channels) need to be bypassed in order to prevent interference of the grooves <b>8</b> with each other. Hence, many grooves <b>8</b> (channels) often have to run complicatedly like a maze.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The work of applying fluorocarbon resin coating, fluorocarbon resin lining, or aluminum oxide film covering to such grooves <b>8</b> requires advanced machining techniques, and huge man-hours for machining. Furthermore, if the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) are in a complicated shape, the accuracy and reliability of the product may be questioned. In such cases, it is effective to provide corrosion resistant piping, instead of forming the corrosion-proof layer <b>29</b>, in the grooves <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">An integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is constituted by joining a plate <b>2</b> and a plate <b>3</b> by an adhesive <b>4</b> or the like. Grooves <b>8</b> are machined in a joining surface between the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b> (an upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>2</b> in the illustrated example). Various constituent instruments <b>191</b> and components <b>192</b> (also indicated by one-dot chain lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) constituting a fuel cell power generation system are arranged on an upper surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>3</b>. These instruments <b>191</b> and components <b>192</b> are connected to the grooves <b>8</b> by communication holes <b>10</b> formed in the plate <b>3</b>. By so doing, the instruments <b>191</b> and components <b>192</b> are tied by the grooves <b>8</b>. The spacing between the instruments <b>191</b>, components <b>192</b> and the plate <b>3</b> is sealed with a sealing material such as an O ring (not shown). These features are the same as for the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">In the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the sectional areas of the grooves <b>8</b> for flowing corrosive fluids are larger than the required sectional areas for direct flowing of the fluid through the grooves <b>8</b>, and corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>, such as a fluorocarbon resin pipe of polytetrafluoroethylene or the like, is accommodated in the grooves <b>8</b> to use the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> as a channel for the corrosive fluid. The corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> may be not only a fluorocarbon resin pipe, but piping made of other corrosion resistant material (such as polyvinyl chloride, synthetic rubber, or other synthetic resin) compatible with the properties of the corrosive fluid. However, the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> may be inserted into predetermined grooves <b>8</b> after integration of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, or the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> may be replaced. Thus, it is preferred to select a flexible material as the material for the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Opposite end portions of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> accommodated in the groove <b>8</b> are joined to a bearer <b>152</b> as a first joining member, and a top-shaped component <b>153</b> as a second joining member. The top-shaped component <b>153</b> has a truncated cone-shaped body portion (joining portion) <b>153</b><i>b </i>having a conical surface <b>153</b><i>a </i>formed on an outer peripheral surface thereof, and has a head portion <b>153</b><i>c </i>on the body portion <b>153</b><i>b</i>. The entire shape of the top-shaped component <b>153</b> is like a top.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A</figref>, <b>23</b>B, <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, there are a case in which one bearer <b>152</b> is used on one corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A</figref>, <b>23</b>B), and a case in which one bearer <b>152</b> is used on a plurality of (two in the illustrated example) lines of corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A</figref>, <b>24</b>B). These bearers <b>152</b> are each fitted into a fitting hole <b>3</b><i>f </i>provided in a plate <b>3</b>, and fixed to a plate <b>2</b> by screws <b>155</b>. A stepped portion <b>152</b><i>a </i>is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the bearer <b>152</b>, and this stepped portion <b>152</b><i>a </i>contacts a stepped portion <b>3</b><i>g </i>formed in the inner peripheral surface of the fitting hole <b>3</b><i>f</i>. A through-hole <b>152</b><i>b </i>is formed at the center of the bearer <b>152</b>, and a conical surface <b>152</b><i>c </i>is formed in part of the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole <b>152</b><i>b</i>. Further, a stepped portion <b>152</b><i>d </i>is formed above the conical surface <b>152</b><i>c </i>by further widening the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole <b>152</b><i>b</i>. The bearer <b>152</b> is halved at a position of a parting line.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The opposite end portions of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> are each joined (fixed) by the bearer <b>152</b> and the top-shaped component <b>153</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>. That is, the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>152</b><i>b </i>of the bearer <b>152</b>, and the body portion <b>153</b><i>b </i>of the top-shaped component <b>153</b> is inserted, under pressure, into the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>. By so doing, the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is broadened by the conical surface <b>153</b><i>a </i>of the body portion <b>153</b><i>b</i>, and the conical surface <b>153</b><i>a </i>of the body portion <b>153</b><i>b </i>is fitted to the conical surface <b>152</b><i>c </i>of the bearer <b>152</b>. As a result, the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is joined (fixed), with its outer diameter side being supported by the conical surface <b>152</b><i>c </i>of the bearer <b>152</b>, and its inner diameter side being supported by the conical surface <b>153</b><i>a </i>of the top-shaped component <b>153</b>. On this occasion, the head portion <b>153</b><i>c </i>of the top-shaped component <b>153</b> is fitted onto the stepped portion <b>152</b><i>d </i>of the bearer <b>152</b>. Thus, the corrosive fluid flows through the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> between the instrument <b>191</b> and the component <b>192</b>. At this time, the corrosive fluid can be prevented from leaking from the end of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">It is normally preferred for the bearer <b>152</b> to be integrally shaped. If the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> of a highly rigid material is used, however, the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is in a toppled state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. If a plurality of lines of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> are joined to one bearer <b>152</b>, the end portions of the lines of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> are in disorderly directions. Thus, the integral bearer <b>152</b> poses difficulty in an operation for joining the ends of the lines of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> (it is conceivable to lengthen the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>, and cut the end of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> after its insertion into the bearer <b>152</b>, but this is a difficult operation, because the position of cutting is inside the bearer <b>152</b>). In this case, the bearer <b>152</b> is halved as in the present embodiment, and one half of the bearer <b>152</b> is inserted into the fitting hole <b>3</b><i>f</i>, where after the other half of the bearer <b>152</b> is inserted into the fitting hole <b>3</b><i>f</i>, whereby the efficiency of the joining operation is improved. In this case, the number of divisions of the bearer <b>152</b> is not restricted to two, but may be three or more.</p>

<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> having the two plates thus joined together, all the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) are formed in one plane, and the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) may have to be bypassed. To bypass the grooves <b>8</b>, the size of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> may have to be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, the number of the instruments and components is small, and the number of the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) is also small, so that their differences are not very marked. Actually, however, many instruments and components as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> are connected together. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) are also so many as to make a maze. As a result, it is often difficult to secure the necessary channel sectional areas, or to accommodate the instruments and components in a compact manner while securing dimensions for separation among the fluids with different temperatures. In the three-dimensional integrated piping plates of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 to 35</figref>, the instruments and components are connected three-dimensionally by the two-stage grooves <b>8</b> (channels), so that the layout of the grooves <b>8</b> can be simplified, and the instruments and components can be disposed in a compact state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 to 35</figref>, the grooves <b>8</b> are provided in the joining surface of the plate <b>2</b> and the joining surface of the plate <b>3</b>, but the grooves <b>8</b> may be formed in the joining surfaces of the intermediate plate <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref> show configuration examples in which a high temperature zone and a low temperature zone are separated using a three-dimensional integrated piping plate.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, a low temperature/high temperature mixed instrument <b>181</b>, a low temperature instrument <b>182</b>, a low temperature/high temperature mixed instrument <b>183</b>, and a high temperature instrument <b>184</b> are disposed on one surface of a three-dimensional integrated piping plate <b>1</b> (a surface of a plate <b>3</b>). Grooves <b>8</b> connecting these instruments are formed in two stages, i.e., in joining surfaces of the plate <b>3</b> and an intermediate plate (in the illustrated example, the joining surface of an intermediate plate <b>161</b>) and joining surfaces of a plate <b>2</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b> (in the illustrated example, the joining surface of the plate <b>2</b>), and the upper-stage grooves <b>8</b> define a low temperature zone where a low temperature fluid flows, while the lower-stage grooves <b>8</b> define a high temperature zone where a high temperature fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, a low temperature/high temperature mixed instrument <b>185</b>, a low temperature instrument <b>186</b>, and a low temperature/high temperature mixed instrument <b>187</b> are disposed on one surface of a three-dimensional integrated piping plate <b>1</b> (a surface of a plate <b>3</b>), while a high temperature instrument <b>188</b> and a high temperature instrument <b>189</b> are disposed on the other surface of the three-dimensional integrated piping plate <b>1</b> (a surface of a plate <b>2</b>). Grooves <b>8</b> connecting these instruments are formed in two stages, i.e., in joining surfaces of the plate <b>3</b> and an intermediate plate <b>161</b> (in the illustrated example, the joining surface of the intermediate plate <b>161</b>) and joining surfaces of the plate <b>2</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b> (in the illustrated example, the joining surface of the plate <b>2</b>), and the upper-stage grooves <b>8</b> define a low temperature zone where a low temperature fluid flows, while the lower-stage grooves <b>8</b> define a high temperature zone where a high temperature fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">In this case, it is effective to provide a heat insulator between the plate <b>2</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b>, although this is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In the foregoing description, the provision of one intermediate plate <b>161</b> between the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> is described. However, this is not limitative, and two or more intermediate plates may be provided between the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b>. That is, four or more plates may be joined to constitute the three-dimensional integrated piping plate. When two or more intermediate plates are provided, the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) are also formed in joining surfaces between the intermediate plates, whereby even more grooves <b>8</b> (channels) can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">As described above, according to the integrated piping plate of the present embodiment, the constituent instruments and components are connected by the grooves <b>8</b> provided in the plate <b>2</b> or plate <b>3</b>. Thus, the channels corresponding to the conventional piping are present in the integrated piping plate, and small instruments, such as valves, electrical components, such as sensors or switches, and electrical wiring can also be assembled into the plate <b>2</b>, or plate <b>3</b>, or plate <b>2</b> and plate <b>3</b>. Thus, the entire apparatus such as the fuel cell power generation system, etc. can be easily modularized, and downsized. Moreover, it suffices to assemble the respective constituent instruments and components to predetermined positions, and there is no need for a complicated pipe laying operation in a narrow space. Thus, the assembly work is easy and the work efficiency is increased. Furthermore, there are few seams, reducing the risk of fluid leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In addition, joining surfaces <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b>, and the grooves <b>8</b> are coated with or lined with fluorocarbon resin, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, or covered with an aluminum oxide film to form a corrosion-proof layer <b>29</b>. By so doing, corrosion of the grooves <b>8</b> by a corrosive fluid flowing through the grooves <b>8</b>, or corrosion of the plate joining surface by ingredients contained in the adhesive <b>4</b> can be prevented to ensure the long life of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. This technique of providing the corrosion-proof layer can, of course, be applied not only to one integrated piping plate, but a plurality of integrated piping plates. For example, the corrosion-proof layer may be provided on the grooves or plate joining surface in the three-dimensional modules of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 13</figref>, or the corrosion-proof layer may be provided on the grooves or plate joining surface in the rest module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, although these modes are not shown. Further, the corrosion-proof layer can be provided on the grooves or plate joining surface in three-dimensional integrated piping plates having an intermediate plate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 to 35</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Besides, the plate <b>2</b> and the plate <b>3</b> are welded at the position of the weld line <b>30</b> surrounding the periphery of the groove <b>8</b>, whereby a fluid flowing through the groove <b>8</b> can be sealed up reliably at the site of the weld line <b>30</b>. This weld sealing technique is, of course, not restricted to the integrated piping plate in a configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and can be applied, for example, to integrated piping plates in any configurations, such as the three-dimensional modules shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 13</figref>, the rest module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and the three-dimensional integrated piping plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, although these applications are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">In addition, a plurality of integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) having respective components and instruments assembled thereto are three-dimensionally modularized, with their back surfaces being superposed. By so doing, further downsizing can be achieved, the channels and control system for fluids can be shortened, response can be quickened, and control can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Also, a plurality of integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) are integrally fixed via a heat insulator <b>16</b><i>a </i>to constitute a heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>A. This measure makes it possible, for example, to dispose low temperature instruments <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, such as control instruments, in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>B in proximity to high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>disposed in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Also, a heat insulating three-dimensional module <b>18</b>B is constituted by integrally connecting and fixing a plurality of integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) via separators <b>31</b>. By so doing, it is possible, for example, to separate the high temperature integrated piping plate <b>1</b>A having high temperature instruments <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>disposed there on, and the low temperature integrated piping plate <b>1</b> having low temperature instruments <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>disposed thereon by the separators <b>31</b>. Thus, thermal influence from each other can be avoided. Moreover, a heat insulating effect can be further enhanced by interposing heat insulators <b>130</b> between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the plural integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) and the separators <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Also, constituent instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b> of the apparatus are interposed between the back surfaces <b>2</b><i>b</i>'s of a plurality of integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.), whereby the spacing between the integrated piping plates can be effectively used, and the apparatus can be further downsized. Furthermore, the integrated piping plates are separated from each other by the constituent instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b>, so that a heat insulating effect can be expected. Particularly when the heat insulators <b>130</b> are interposed between the instruments <b>139</b>, <b>140</b> and the integrated piping plates <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, the heat insulating effect becomes marked.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Also, a plurality of integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) are disposed on the same rest <b>32</b> with a heat insulating spacing L, so that these integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) can ignore (prevent) thermal influence from each other. If a heat insulator <b>145</b> is interposed between the integrated piping plates <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, etc.) and the rest <b>32</b>, a heat insulating effect is further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Also, a heat shutoff groove <b>35</b> is provided between a high temperature zone where high temperature instruments <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>, <b>33</b><i>c </i>are disposed, and a low temperature zone where low temperature instruments <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>are disposed, on the same integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. Thus, heat from the high temperature zone can be shut off to avoid thermal influence on the low temperature zone. Furthermore, a heat insulator is filled into the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b>, or a refrigerant, such as air or water, is flowed into the heat shutoff groove <b>35</b>, whereby the heat shutoff effect becomes very high.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Also, instead of forming the corrosion-proof layer in the groove <b>8</b>, corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is accommodated in the groove <b>8</b>, and a corrosive fluid is flowed through the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>. By so doing, even if the grooves <b>8</b> (channels) are numerous and complicated, corrosion resistance to the corrosive fluid can be easily ensured, without need for an advanced machining technology. Moreover, it is possible to select and use the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> of a material adapted for the properties of the corrosive fluid, so that the reliability of corrosion resisting performance is increased. Furthermore, treatment for corrosion resistance (channel formation using corrosion resistant piping) can be restricted to the channels for the corrosive fluid. Thus, machining man-hours are reduced, and the integrated piping plate <b>1</b> can be provided for a low price. Besides, when corrosion resisting performance declines because of secular changes, corrosion resisting performance can be resumed simply by replacing the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> accommodated in the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, rather than replacing the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>. Thus, the cost of maintenance can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Also, when a flexible material is used as the material for the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b>, the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> can be inserted into the groove <b>8</b> after integration of the integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, or the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> can be replaced. Thus, operationability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Also, the end portion of the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> is joined with the use of a bearer <b>152</b> having a through-hole <b>152</b><i>b </i>having a conical surface <b>152</b><i>c </i>formed in an inner peripheral surface thereof, and a top-shaped component <b>153</b> having a conical surface <b>153</b><i>a </i>formed in an outer peripheral surface thereof. By this measure, an operation for joining the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> can be performed easily, and leakage of fluid can be prevented reliably. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a bearer <b>152</b> and a plate <b>3</b> are integrally formed, or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, an instrument <b>191</b> or a component <b>192</b> and the top-shaped component <b>153</b> are integrally formed. By this measure, the number of components is decreased, and the joining operation is facilitated. If the corrosion resistant piping <b>151</b> of a highly rigid material is used, or the path of piping is complicated, the efficiency of the joining operating can be improved by dividing the bearer <b>152</b> into a plurality of portions.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Also, there may be a case in which three or more plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>161</b> are joined to constitute a three-dimensional integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, and grooves <b>8</b> are formed in joining surfaces between the plate <b>2</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b>, in joining surfaces between the plate <b>3</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b>, and if two or more of the intermediate plates <b>161</b> are provided, in joining surfaces between the intermediate plate <b>161</b> and the intermediate plate <b>161</b>, whereby many grooves <b>8</b> are provided in agreement with many instruments and components. Even in this case, the layout of the grooves <b>8</b> is simplified, and the instruments and components can be arranged compactly. In this three-dimensional integrated piping plate <b>1</b>, moreover, grooves <b>8</b> in a plurality of stages are allocated to a high temperature zone and a low temperature zone, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>. Consequently, thermal influence from each other can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In the above descriptions, stud bolts <b>6</b> are used as the fixing bolts for the instrument and the component, but they are not limitative, and ordinary bolts or through bolts may be used.

<p id="p-0270" num="0269">A machining method for an integrated piping plate <b>201</b> according to the present embodiment will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C, when a plate <b>202</b> and a plate <b>203</b> are to be joined for integration, the first step is to superpose the plate <b>202</b> and the plate <b>203</b>. In the plate <b>202</b>, a groove <b>208</b> to serve as a channel for a fluid (liquid or gas) has been machined. In the plate <b>203</b>, communication holes <b>210</b> as a communication between the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> and instruments or components constituting an apparatus, such as a fuel cell power generation system, have been machined. In this superposed state, a groove <b>221</b> to serve as a weld groove is machined in the plate <b>203</b> so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>. Then, this groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove is welded.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The fluid channel groove <b>208</b> is not restricted to a joining surface <b>202</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>202</b>, but may be formed in a joining surface <b>203</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>203</b>, and the communication holes <b>210</b> are not restricted to the plate <b>203</b>, but may be formed in the plate <b>202</b>. The instrument and component are not restricted to a surface <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>203</b>, but may be formed on a surface <b>202</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>202</b>, or may be formed on the surfaces <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>203</b><i>a </i>of both plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>. That is, the instrument and component can be provided on one of or both of the surfaces of the integrated piping plate <b>201</b>. Nor is the groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove restricted to the plate <b>203</b>, but the groove <b>221</b> may be formed in the plate <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C show the state in course of machining. In these drawings, (I) portion shows a portion in which the groove <b>221</b> as the weld groove has been machined and welded, whereby the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> have been integrated. (II) portion shows a portion in which the groove <b>221</b> as the weld groove has been machined and is scheduled to be welded to integrate the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>. (III) portion shows a portion in which the groove <b>221</b> as the weld groove is scheduled to be machined and welded to integrate the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>. Actually, the shape of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> formed in the plate <b>202</b> is complicated, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, but in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 to 44</figref>, is shown in a simplified manner for convenience of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">This machining method will be described in further detail. The plate <b>203</b> having the communication holes <b>210</b> machined therein is superposed on the plate <b>202</b> having the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> machined therein. Then, a weld groove machining tool <b>222</b> is moved while tracing the outer periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>, as indicated by an arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, in accordance with numerical control (tracer control) based on machining data (numerical control data) on the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>. By this measure, the groove <b>221</b> for a weld groove is formed in the plate <b>202</b>. That is, when the surroundings of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref> are to be welded, a weld line for extending along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> is formed at a suitable distance e from the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40C</figref>, based on the machining data obtained when machining the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> in the plate <b>202</b>. The weld groove machining tool <b>222</b> is run along this weld line to machine the groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">After the groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove is formed, a welding machine <b>223</b> is caused to move while tracing the outer periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> (along the weld line), as indicated by the arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, to weld the groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove, thereby integrating the plate <b>202</b> and the plate <b>203</b>. At this time, travel control of the welding machine <b>223</b> (control of the welding position) is performed in accordance with numerical control (tracer control) based on machining data on the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> (numerical control data), as in the case of the weld groove machining tool <b>222</b>, or based on machining data on the weld groove machining tool <b>222</b> (numerical control data). Weld groove machining and welding are performed continuously on one station, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref>. That is, welding is started in succession to weld groove machining.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The reason for the initiation of welding in succession to weld groove machining (the reason for start of welding before completion of weld groove machining) is as follows: If weld groove machining is completed before start of welding, an island-like portion surrounded with the weld <b>221</b> for the weld groove, which has been formed by the weld groove machining, becomes free, and this portion cannot be held at a fixed position. The timing of starting welding may be immediately after start of weld groove machining, or may be a predetermined time after start of weld groove machining. This timing can be set as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C show the state in which the groove <b>221</b> for the weld groove has been welded up to the surface <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>203</b>. However, this mode is not limitative, but welding may be kept within the leg length which enables the joining of the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> to be maintained. As the method of welding for the groove <b>221</b> for weld groove, MIG welding (metal inert gas sealed welding) or TIG welding (tungsten inert gas sealed welding) is suitable, but other welding method may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">According to the machining method of the present embodiment, joining surfaces <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> are welded so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>, whereby the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are welded. This type of welding, compared with joining of the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> by an adhesive, increases the durability of the plate joining portion, and constructs a firm weld structure, thus increasing pressure resistance. Also, the coupling bolts for the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> become unnecessary, so that the entire integrated piping plate can be further downsized. Furthermore, this machining method facilitates the line operation of joining procedure, and thus increases the work efficiency, contributing to a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The welding of the joining surfaces <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> is not restricted to welding so as to extend along the entire periphery of each fluid channel groove <b>208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>, but includes sharing of one weld line <b>250</b> (weld line sharing portion <b>250</b><i>a</i>) between the adjacent grooves <b>208</b> for weld grooves as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41B and 41C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41B and 41C</figref>, the adjacent fluid channel grooves <b>208</b> are close to each other with a narrow gap d. For these fluid channel grooves <b>208</b>, therefore, only one weld line <b>250</b> (weld line sharing portion <b>250</b><i>a</i>) extending along the entire periphery of one of the fluid channel grooves <b>208</b> is formed, and this weld line sharing portion <b>250</b><i>a </i>is shared with the weld line <b>250</b> extending along the entire periphery of the other fluid channel groove <b>208</b>. Of course, the formation of the groove <b>221</b> for weld groove so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> is not restricted to forming the groove <b>221</b> for weld groove so as to extend along the entire periphery of each fluid channel groove <b>208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>, but includes sharing of one groove <b>221</b> for weld groove (portion <b>221</b><i>a </i>which shares the groove for weld groove) between the adjacent fluid channel grooves <b>208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41B and 41C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Other machining method for an integrated piping plate <b>201</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B and <b>42</b>C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B and <b>42</b>C show a method for integrating a plate <b>202</b> and a plate <b>203</b> by use of friction stir welding (hereinafter referred to as FSW), a welding technique rendered publicly known by patent gazettes (Japanese Patent Nos. 2792233 and 2712838).</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, the plate <b>203</b> having communication holes <b>210</b> machined therein is superposed on the plate <b>202</b> having a fluid channel groove <b>208</b> machined therein. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, the surroundings of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> of the plate <b>202</b> are welded. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42C</figref>, joining surfaces <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> are welded so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> at a suitable distance f from the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> to weld the plate <b>202</b> and the plate <b>203</b>. This mode is the same as in the machining method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C, and so detailed explanations for it are omitted. The differences from the machining method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</figref>, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">With the machining method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B and <b>42</b>C, machining of the groove for weld groove is not performed. First, a tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>of an FSW welding machine <b>225</b> for FSW welding is located at a start point at which the welding is started. Its rotation is started, and an axial pressure is applied to it to insert the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>into the plate <b>203</b> up to a position in a height direction which is suitable for integration. By starting the rotation of the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a</i>, frictional heat is generated. Also, the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>is moved while tracing the outer periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> as shown by an arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref> to weld the joining surfaces <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b>. At this time, travel control of the FSW welding machine <b>225</b> (control of the welding position) is performed in accordance with numerical control (tracer control) based on machining data on the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> (numerical control data), like travel control of the welding machine <b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</figref>, <b>42</b>B and <b>42</b>C show the state in course of machining. In these drawings, (I) portion shows a portion in which the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> have been integrated by welding. (II) portion shows a portion in which welding is scheduled to be performed to integrate the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The insertion of the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>into the plate <b>203</b> can be facilitated by machining beforehand a hole for insertion of the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>at the position of the start point of FSW welding. However, this hole is not a prerequisite. The insertion is not restricted to the plate <b>203</b>, but the tip tool <b>225</b><i>a </i>may be inserted into the plate <b>202</b>, and welding may be performed at the plate <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">According to the machining method of the present embodiment, the joining surfaces <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> are welded so as to extend along the entire periphery of the fluid channel groove <b>208</b> (of course, the welding is not restricted to welding so as to extend along the entire periphery of each fluid channel groove <b>208</b>, but includes sharing of one weld line (weld line sharing portion) between the adjacent grooves <b>208</b> for weld grooves), whereby the plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are joined. This type of welding, compared with joining of the plates by an adhesive, increases the durability of the plate joining portion, and constructs a firm weld structure, thus increasing pressure resistance. Also, the coupling bolts for the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> become unnecessary, so that the entire integrated piping plate can be further downsized. Furthermore, this machining method facilitates the line operation of joining procedure, and thus increases the work efficiency, contributing to a low cost. Besides, the adoption of FSW welding makes it unnecessary to machine a groove for a weld groove, and thus can achieve an even lower cost.</p>

<p id="p-0299" num="0298">According to the machining line of the present embodiment, coherent machining of the plates <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> constituting the integrated piping plate <b>201</b> can be easily performed, thus contributing to the cost reduction of the equipment. Furthermore, the adoption of the FSW welding machine <b>225</b> makes machining of the groove for weld groove unnecessary, and thus can achieve a further cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The machining method (joining method) of the present invention is not necessarily restricted to joining of the two plates <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, but is applicable to joining of three or more plates.

<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Also, the present invention can be applied not only to machining of the integrated piping plate for use in a fuel cell power generation system, but also to machining of the integrated piping plate for use in various devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</figref> shows a plate <b>302</b> produced by forming depressions (hereinafter referred to as grooves <b>301</b>) of predetermined shapes, which serve as fluid channels, as a result of press working of an aluminum plate or an aluminum alloy plate.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Press working is performed by plastic working a metal plate of a highly plastic metallic material under pressure with the use of a mold having an arbitrary shape. This is a machining technique with dimensional accuracy and excellent volume productivity. This technique can select a corrosion resistant material as an object to be machined.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref> is a cross sectional view taken on line A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b> of the plate <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref>, the cross sectional shape of the groove <b>301</b> is a rectangular depression having a suitable width L<b>2</b> and a suitable depth H<b>2</b>. For easy press working, a corner <b>301</b><i>a </i>has suitable roundness R, and a side wall portion <b>301</b><i>b </i>of the groove <b>301</b> is suitably inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">To maintain the flow velocity of a fluid, flowing through the groove <b>301</b>, at a predetermined value, it is necessary to vary the sectional area of the groove <b>301</b> according to each groove <b>301</b>. In doing so, it is advantageous in terms of assembly to keep the depth H<b>2</b> of the groove <b>301</b> constant and vary its width L<b>2</b>, where necessary, thereby ensuring a predetermined sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Since a corner <b>301</b><i>c </i>at the bottom of the groove <b>301</b> has suitable roundness R, it is possible to minimize the difference in flow velocity between the center of the fluid and the periphery of the fluid in contact with the corner <b>301</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>301</b>, thus decreasing stagnation of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45C</figref> is a cross sectional view taken on line A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b> of the plate <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</figref>, which represents another example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45C</figref>, the cross sectional shape of the groove <b>301</b> is an arc-shaped groove in which the bottom of the groove <b>301</b> has a suitable radius R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The features and functions of this arced groove are the same as the rectangular groove <b>301</b> explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref>. For easy press working, a corner <b>301</b><i>d </i>of the arcuate groove has suitable roundness R, and the sectional area of the groove <b>301</b> is varied according to each groove <b>301</b> so that the flow velocity of a fluid, flowing through the groove <b>301</b>, is kept at a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Since the groove <b>301</b> is an arcuate groove having the radius R<b>1</b> at the bottom, it is possible to minimize the difference in flow velocity between the center of the fluid and the periphery of the fluid in contact with the groove <b>301</b>, thus decreasing stagnation of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A</figref>, <b>45</b>B and <b>45</b>C show the examples produced by press working. However, the manufacturing method for the plate <b>302</b> having the grooves for fluid channels is not restricted to press working, but may be shaping by precision casting. This machining method can prepare a casting with material uniformity and high dimensional accuracy, i.e., a plate having grooves for fluid channels, by forming a mold and pouring an arbitrary alloy or the like into the mold. With precision casting, unlike press working, a material other than a highly plastic material, such as aluminum, can be selected as a material for the plate, and like press working, a corrosion resistant material can also be selected. Also, a plate of a complicated shape can be formed using a mold, and its surface can be smoothed as in press working. Thus, it is possible to form grooves, without increasing excess resistance (conductance) in the grooves for flow of fluids. Even according to this method, grooves as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45B and 45C</figref> can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">Welding of the plates is performed by superposing the plate <b>303</b> having communication holes <b>311</b> machined therein onto the plate <b>302</b> having fluid channel grooves <b>301</b> formed therein, machining grooves for weld grooves in the plate <b>303</b> at suitable distances from the fluid channel grooves <b>301</b> so as to extend along the entire peripheries of the fluid channel grooves <b>301</b>, and then welding the grooves for weld grooves by electromagnetic force-controlled hybrid welding or the like, with the plates being gripped at a strong pressure. As a result, the plates are welded, and the fluids flowing through the fluid channel grooves can be sealed up reliably at the sites of the grooves for weld grooves. The welding method for the grooves as weld grooves may be MIG welding, TIG welding, or other welding method.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A</figref>, <b>46</b>B and <b>46</b>C show another example of the joining method for an integrated piping plate according to the present invention. A method for joining a plate <b>302</b> and a plate <b>303</b> by friction stir welding to integrate them is shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">As stated earlier, friction stir welding (FSW method) is a welding method rendered publicly known by Japanese Patent No. 2792233 and so on. The FSW method uses a material, which is harder than a base material to be joined, as a probe (tip tool <b>308</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</figref>), presses the probe against the base material to be joined, periodically moves the probe in circular motions, etc. relative to the base material to generate frictional heat. As a result, the base material is fused to create a plastic region. The plastic region is fused and solidified together with another base material to be joined, whereby both base materials are welded.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The FSW method, unlike other welding method, can weld base materials, without necessarily requiring a groove for weld groove during welding. Thus, the FSW method is suitable for an efficient machining operation. Apparatus involved in the FSW method does not need a great input power, but is capable of welding with a high efficiency. Thus, this method is economical, and can contribute to cost reduction. The method is also easy to control, and has high positional accuracy, so that it is suitable for automation and volume production.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">According to the FSW method, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</figref>, the plate <b>303</b> having communication holes <b>311</b> machined therein is superposed on the plate <b>302</b> having a groove <b>301</b> machined therein. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</figref>, the surroundings of the groove <b>301</b> of the plate <b>302</b> are welded at a position separated by a suitable distance f so as to extend along the entire periphery of the groove <b>301</b> to perform welding.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Concretely, a tip tool <b>308</b><i>a </i>of a welding machine <b>308</b> for the FSW method is set at a start point at which the welding is started. Starting at this point, the tip tool <b>308</b><i>a </i>is rotated to generate frictional heat, and fuse the plate <b>303</b>. During this course, the tip tool <b>308</b><i>a </i>is inserted under pressure to a predetermined depth. A fusion zone of the plate <b>303</b> undergoes fusion and solidification together with the plate <b>302</b>, whereby the plate <b>302</b> and the plate <b>303</b> are welded and integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref>, a region indicated by arrows in {circle around (1)} shows a portion of the plate <b>303</b> integrated by the FSW welding, and a region indicated by arrows in {circle around (2)} shows a portion of the plate <b>303</b> before being integrated by welding. {circle around (3)} shows a portion of the plates <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> fused and solidified as a result of the FSW method.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47C</figref> to be described later on, joining may be performed by the FSW method applied in the plate <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A</figref>, <b>47</b>B, <b>47</b>C and <b>47</b>D show an example of an integrated piping plate according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref> shows a side view of an integrated piping plate <b>304</b>, which comprises a plate <b>302</b> and a plate <b>303</b> joined by FSW welding. A bracket of an instrument <b>305</b> and a component <b>305</b><i>a </i>itself located on the plate <b>303</b> are fixed by stud bolts <b>306</b> implanted in the plate <b>303</b> and nuts <b>307</b> via sealing materials <b>310</b>, such as O rings. The instrument <b>305</b> and component <b>305</b><i>a </i>fixed on the plate <b>303</b> communicate with each other by a groove <b>301</b> having a suitable sectional area through communication holes <b>311</b>, thus being capable of flowing a high temperature, high pressure fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref> shows joining by FSW welding to the plate <b>302</b> applied from the plate <b>303</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47C</figref> shows joining by FSW welding to the plate <b>303</b> applied from the plate <b>302</b>. Since FSW welding does not require a groove for a weld groove, the degree of freedom during machining is high as shown in these drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47D</figref> shows, in a plan view, that the instrument <b>305</b> and the component <b>305</b><i>a </i>are connected by the groove <b>301</b> through the communication holes <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</figref> show an example of an integrated piping plate in a three-dimensional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</figref> is a side view of an example of the integrated piping plate according to the present invention constituted in a three-dimensional configuration. Two integrated piping plates <b>304</b> and <b>304</b>&#x2032; are mounted to each other in a vertically opposed manner, and end portions of plates <b>302</b> and <b>302</b>&#x2032; are sealed by bolts <b>312</b> and nuts <b>313</b> via sealing materials to constitute the three-dimensional integrated piping plate. Not only are the integrated piping plates made three-dimensional in a vertically opposed manner as in the present structure, but can the integrated piping plates be located, for example, in a perpendicular relationship to form the three-dimensional integrated piping plate. By so doing, the space can be used without waste, thus resulting in a very compact configuration. Furthermore, a refrigerant, such as air, is flowed through a space Q formed by the plates <b>302</b> and <b>302</b>&#x2032; of the upper and lower integrated piping plates <b>304</b> and <b>304</b>&#x2032;, whereby a high temperature fluid flowing through a groove <b>301</b> can be cooled. In this case, the plates <b>302</b>, <b>302</b>&#x2032; do not have an excess portion acting as a heat storage portion, because the plates <b>302</b>, <b>302</b>&#x2032; are shaped by press working or precision casting. Moreover, the surface area for the refrigerant is so wide that cooling can take plate with high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Joining of the opposed plates <b>302</b> and <b>302</b>&#x2032; of the integrated piping plates <b>304</b> and <b>304</b>&#x2032; may be performed by the FSW method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>, as well as by the use of the bolts <b>312</b> and nuts <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Next, a fuel cell power generation system will be described as an example of application of the integrated piping plate for use in a fixed unit incorporating piping and wiring into an apparatus, and a transportable integrated unit.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows an example of a system diagram of an ordinary fuel cell power generation system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, a liquid fuel <b>441</b><i>a</i>, such as methanol, is vaporized by a carburetor <b>442</b> with the use of waste heat or the like of a reformer <b>449</b>, and heated by a heat exchanger <b>443</b>. Then, the vapor is introduced into a desulfurization device <b>444</b> together with part of a hydrogen-rich gas from a CO converter <b>446</b> to have its sulfur content removed. A gaseous fuel <b>441</b><i>b</i>, such as natural gas, on the other hand, bypasses the carburetor <b>442</b>, and is directly supplied to the heat exchanger <b>443</b>. If a fuel with a low sulfur content is used, the desulfurization device <b>444</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">The fuel gas, which has been desulfurized, is heated by a heat exchanger <b>448</b> together with steam <b>447</b> generated by a steam separator <b>445</b>, and is then fed to the reformer <b>449</b>. In the reformer <b>449</b>, the fuel gas is reformed to generate a reformed gas rich in hydrogen. The reformed gas from the reformer <b>449</b> is cooled by a heat exchanger <b>450</b>, and then carbon monoxide in the reformed gas is converted to carbon dioxide in the CO converter <b>446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">The reformed gas from the CO converter <b>446</b> is further cooled by a heat exchanger <b>451</b>, and then introduced into a condenser <b>452</b>, where unreacted steam is removed by condensation. Condensate separated from the condenser <b>452</b> is sent to the steam separator <b>445</b>, and fed again as steam <b>447</b> to the reformer <b>449</b>. The reformed gas departing from the condenser <b>452</b> is heated by a heat exchanger <b>453</b>, and then fed to a fuel cell body <b>454</b>, where hydrogen in the reformed gas is used for a cell reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">Air <b>458</b> supplied as an oxidizing agent is heated in a heat exchanger <b>459</b>, and introduced into the fuel cell body <b>454</b>, where oxygen in the air <b>458</b> is used in the cell reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">An exhaust gas from the fuel cell body <b>454</b> is heated in a heat exchanger <b>460</b>, and brought into a condenser <b>461</b>, where water formed is removed upon condensation, and discharged to the outside of the system. The resulting water is also fed to the steam separator <b>445</b>, where it is used as steam <b>447</b>. Since the cell reaction in the fuel cell body <b>454</b> is an exothermic reaction, the fuel cell body <b>454</b> and peripheral devices are generally provided with a cooling device <b>462</b> using water or air as a refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Another exhaust gas containing unreacted hydrogen from the fuel cell body <b>454</b> passes through a splitting machine <b>472</b>, and is used, together with external air <b>468</b>, as a heating fuel <b>467</b> for the reformer <b>449</b> performing an endothermic reaction. The remaining exhaust gas is treated with a burner <b>473</b>, and then discharged. If the heating fuel <b>467</b> is insufficient at this time, part of an outlet gas from the desulfurization device <b>444</b> is used as an auxiliary fuel <b>476</b>. A combustion exhaust gas from the reformer <b>449</b> is partly used as a heat source for the carburetor <b>442</b>. The remainder is cooled in a heat exchanger <b>474</b>, then fed to a condenser <b>475</b>, and released into the atmosphere after separation of the resulting water. The resulting water is returned to the steam separator <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">Next, an outline of control in the fuel cell power generation system will be described. First, the flow rate of the reformed gas to be fed to the fuel cell body <b>454</b> is controlled by detecting a load current to a load <b>466</b> by an ammeter I, sending its signals to a control device <b>469</b>, and opening or closing a flow control valve <b>470</b><i>a </i>or <b>470</b><i>b </i>based on signals from the control device <b>469</b>. The amount of supply of steam <b>447</b> necessary for reforming of the fuel gas is controlled by detecting the flow rate of the fuel gas by a flow meter <b>477</b>, and opening or closing a steam flow control valve <b>471</b> based on signals from the control device <b>469</b>. The temperature inside the reformer <b>449</b> is constantly monitored by a temperature sensor T, and controlled by flow control valves <b>470</b><i>a</i>, <b>470</b><i>b </i>for fuels <b>441</b><i>a</i>, <b>441</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">As described above, various instruments, components, wiring and control instruments are disposed in the fuel cell power generation system. Large piping and small piping are provided complicatedly so that fluids or gases with various properties, temperatures and pressures flow among these devices. Particularly in a transportable, integrated system for loading on a vehicle, efforts have been made to arrange numerous instruments and pipe lines at a high density in a narrow space for downsizing. The integrated piping plate is applied as means for this purpose. In fuel supply facilities of the fuel cell power generation system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, piping for fuel supply is the groove <b>301</b> in the plate <b>302</b>, and the flow control valves <b>470</b><i>a</i>, <b>470</b><i>b </i>and flow meter <b>477</b> for flow rate control are disposed on the plate <b>303</b>. These measures can result in an integrated piping plate for controlling the flow rate of fuel flowing through the groove <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">In the above examples, the fuel cell power generation system has been illustrated. However, the present invention can be applied not only to an integrated piping plate for use in the fuel cell power generation system, but also to an integrated piping plate for use in various apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">While the present invention has been described by the present embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto, but may be varied in many other ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
