<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to ball screw assemblies, and more particularly to ball screw assemblies having spacers between load bearing balls.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ball screw assemblies are used to effect linear actuation in various industries, such as the machine tool and aerospace fields, for example, wherein improved performance factors, such as, increased speeds, reduced weight, and increased life between servicing, is under constant demand. As such, ball screw assemblies have incorporated ceramic balls between external ball grooves of a screw and internal ball grooves of a nut in attempts to meet ever increasing performance level demands. Though the incorporation of ceramic balls has provided some performance improvements, particularly increased speed capabilities, there remain some challenges in meeting the demands for increased life, increased load carrying capabilities, and reduced noise in use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A ball screw assembly has an axially extending screw with an external helical groove and a nut with a through bore for receipt of the screw. The through bore has an internal helical groove adapted for cooperation with the external helical groove to define a ball raceway. A plurality of load bearing balls is disposed in the raceway for rolling contact with the internal and external grooves. A spacer is disposed between adjacent ones of the load bearing balls to prevent the balls from contacting one another.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now in more detail to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a ball nut and screw assembly <b>1</b>, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,905,533 to Benton et al., which is owned by the applicant's assignee, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The assembly has a screw, generally designated <b>10</b>, assembled with a ball nut, generally designated <b>11</b>. The screw <b>10</b> has a continuous external helical thread defining a land <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and a continuous external helical groove <b>12</b> of generally semi-circular or Gothic arch form in cross section. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ball nut <b>11</b> has a mating internal helical groove <b>14</b> adapted for cooperation with external helical groove <b>12</b> of the screw <b>10</b> to facilitate translation of the nut <b>11</b> relative to the screw <b>10</b>. Generally, a raceway is defined between the groove <b>12</b> of the screw <b>10</b> and the groove <b>14</b> of the nut <b>11</b> for receipt of a plurality of load bearing balls <b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), which engage and roll relative to the grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to permit relative rotation and translation of the nut <b>11</b> and screw <b>10</b> with relatively low frictional impedance. A plurality of self-aligning spacer elements, referred to as spacers <b>13</b> hereafter, are preferably disposed between adjacent load carrying balls <b>9</b> to prevent the balls <b>9</b> from coming into frictional contact with one another, thereby reducing the potential for galling frictional wear of the balls <b>9</b>. The internal helical groove <b>14</b> of the ball nut <b>11</b> is bounded by an internal helical land or thread <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and conventional external ball returns <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) span a number of turns of the helical grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and communicate with the grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to provide ball recirculation. A clamp plate <b>16</b>, secured by fasteners <b>17</b>, may be provided to secure the ball return tubes <b>15</b> in position. Though the ball returns <b>15</b> are shown, by way of example, as being an external type, it should be recognized that internal or end returns can be used. Trunnions T, by way of example and without limitation, can be provided on the nut <b>11</b> to facilitate mounting the ball screw and nut assembly <b>1</b> in position.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the load bearing balls <b>9</b> are spherical with a predetermined radius of curvature having a diameter D, wherein the diameter D is determined largely by the load capacity and speed requirements demanded in the intended application. To facilitate achieving a desired D*n value, generally between 200,000 and 350,000, (known as the product of the on-center diameter across load carrying balls multiplied by the relative rpm between the screw <b>10</b> and nut <b>11</b>), the load bearing balls <b>9</b> are preferably formed, such as, by way of example and without limitation, by being molded, from a relatively hard, high temperature, low density ceramic material, such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), for example. It should be recognized that other ceramic materials, such as alumina oxide, ruby sapphire and zirconia, by way of examples without limitation, are contemplated to be available and suitable for use.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The spacers <b>13</b> are formed having a spherical outer surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) with a diameter (d) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that can be equal to the diameter D of the balls <b>9</b>, however, is preferably less than the diameter D of the balls by approximately 0.002-0.003&#x2033;. As such, the spacers <b>13</b> are generally assured of not being placed under load across the grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in use. The spacers <b>13</b> are preferably constructed from a hard, relatively slippery or low friction, polymeric material having a relatively high resistance to heat, which is more elastic or yieldable than the balls <b>9</b>, such as Nylon, Teflon&#xae;, or polyamide-imide (Torlon&#xae;), by way of examples and without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To facilitate self-alignment of the spacers <b>13</b> relative to the balls <b>9</b>, the spacers <b>13</b> preferably have at least six concave surfaces, referred to hereafter as dimples <b>20</b>, extending radially inwardly from their outer surfaces <b>19</b>. The dimples <b>20</b> are arranged relative to one another about the circumference of the spacer <b>13</b> so that each dimple <b>20</b> is diametrically opposite another dimple <b>20</b> to define opposite pairs of working surfaces. It should be recognized that more dimples may be formed, in even numbers, such as eight or ten, for example. The dimples <b>20</b> have a concavity with a radius (r) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that is at least slightly greater than the radius of curvature of the load bearing balls <b>9</b>, and therefore, is also greater than the radius of the spacer diameter (d). As such, each ball <b>9</b> impacts an adjacent spacer dimple <b>20</b> so that the curvature of the ball <b>9</b> is in non-conforming contact with the curvature of the dimple <b>20</b>, wherein a point contact, generally designated at contact point (C), is established, thereby significantly reducing the rolling friction between the balls <b>9</b> and the spacers <b>13</b>. In addition, annular pockets (P) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) are generally formed by the non-conforming relative curvatures between the concave surfaces <b>20</b> of the spacers <b>13</b> and the balls <b>9</b> to facilitate retaining lubrication within the pockets P between the balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b> are preferably loaded in alternating sequence and in numbers to define a closed loop circuit with a predetermined and desirable amount of potential spacing, referred to hereafter as lash, throughout the circuit of balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b>. Initially, upon loading the balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b>, the total amount of lash within the string of balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b> is preferably less than the maximum diameter (d) of the spacers <b>13</b>, thereby, preferably preventing the engaged dimples <b>20</b> of the spacers <b>13</b> from rotating out of engagement with the respective adjacent balls <b>9</b> during initial use. Accordingly, the spacers <b>13</b> remain in a self-aligned arrangement relative to the balls <b>9</b>, as initially loaded and during initial use. It should be recognized that while loading the balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b>, the spacers automatically rotate so that one pair of dimples <b>20</b> becomes self-aligned with the load bearing balls <b>9</b> to establish the desired amount of lash within the assembly <b>1</b>. When the proper alignment has been achieved, the spacers <b>13</b> are preferably out of contact with the grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> such that a gap is defined between the spacers <b>13</b> and grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the spacers <b>13</b> are generally not under load across the grooves <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, upon the built-in lash increasing over time, such as occurs through wearing of the balls <b>9</b> and/or dimples <b>20</b> engaged with the load bearing balls <b>9</b>, the total lash within the circuit eventually increases. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the total lash (l) eventually becomes substantially equal to or slightly greater than the diameter (d) of the spacers <b>13</b>. As such, one or more of the spacers <b>13</b> is permitted to rotate about an axis other than an axis (A) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) about which the balls <b>9</b> and spacers <b>13</b> are generally aligned, thereby allowing the initially engaged dimples <b>20</b> to rotate out of engagement with the adjacent balls <b>9</b> to bring a different pair of diametrically opposite dimples <b>20</b> into aligned abutting engagement with the adjacent balls <b>9</b>. As such, though the total lash (l) within the ball screw assembly <b>1</b> inherently increases over time, the ability of the spacers <b>13</b> to rotate different pairs of diametrically opposite dimples <b>20</b> into and out of engagement with adjacent load bearing balls <b>9</b> allows for at least some of the increase in lash to be removed. As such, the spacers <b>13</b>, while preventing the balls <b>9</b> from contacting one another, also act to control and limit the amount of lash within the assembly <b>1</b> by rotating pairs of less worn dimples <b>20</b> into self aligned engagement with the balls <b>9</b>. Stated another way, a generally constant amount of built-in lash within the ball screw assembly <b>1</b> can be achieved by maintaining a generally constant minimum diametrical distance (X) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) across valleys of the opposite contact points (C) of the spacers <b>13</b> in use. Therefore, as the distance (X) begins to decrease across one set of increasingly worn diametrically opposite dimples <b>20</b>, a new or less worn set of dimples <b>20</b> having a greater distance (X) is rotated into aligned engagement with the balls <b>9</b>.</p>
