<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention is in the field of preservation, transportation, storage, and retrieval of temperature-sensitive materials, more specifically biochemical materials.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The decomposition of organic matter, like most chemical and biochemical reactions, is normally accelerated by increased temperature. Refrigeration has long been used to slow such reactions, and today basically the same technology that is used to preserve foodstuffs is used to preserve biologicals. Thus, the background technology for preservation of biologicals is food preservation. Desirable improvements in the preservation of biochemical materials emerge in a discussion of the similarities and differences between that and the preservation of food.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To keep perishable food safe for a few days, it is generally necessary only to maintain its temperature ten to fifteen degrees Celsius below room temperature. Even under these conditions, however, some thermal degradation still occurs. Some complex organic molecules, such as those responsible for flavors, degrade into less savory substances, and larger structures such as sols and cellular matrices responsible for the desirable texture of food may also break down more or less rapidly depending on the temperature at which they are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Freezing of aqueous organic materials can slow such reactions to a greater extent than mere cooling, but the processes of freezing and later thawing can themselves damage complex molecules, sols, and tissue structures. Thus, the more careful the regulation of temperature in a proper range below room temperature and also above freezing, the better food is preserved for later consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Biochemical materials stored for later use generally require more precise temperature control. This is because, generally speaking, biochemical compounds are large molecules and/or mechanically complex mixtures, the utility of which is dependent on maintenance of the exact original structure. Drugs, vaccines, living organisms and tissue samples, for example, are useless, even sometimes dangerous, unless preserved in nearly pristine condition. Small or rapid changes in temperature can create undesirable chemical byproducts or damage desirable sol or crystal structures.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Up to now, temperature control of biologicals has been accomplished merely by placing a more sensitive thermostat on a conventional refrigerator box. Such units have been made &#x201c;portable&#x201d; by loading them onto trucks and powering them with portable generators or large battery modules. These are neither amenable to rapid deployment, because of their weight, nor to use in locations where power is at a premium. They also lack the aesthetic appearance desirable for use in a hospital or medical practice setting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Prior art sample preservation units therefore generally comprise a single box, that is, only one temperature zone, typically one that is maintained at approximately 5 degrees Celsius. If freezing of samples is needed, a second complete unit has been required.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of biochemical materials which distinguishes them from ordinary perishables is the need for careful segregation of samples (to prevent cross-contamination) and cleanliness, and for easy and rapid organization and retrieval. Current practice is merely to place marked containers on a shelf within the refrigerated space. This works, of course, but better organization within the box is needed to reduce the potential for spillage and cross-contamination and to make it easier to find a specific item rapidly and accurately.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTS OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is a storage apparatus for biologicals having the objects of improved versatility, portability, temperature stability, sample integrity, retrievability, and aesthetics. The improvement in versatility is provided by addition of a second cooled zone, e.g., a freezing zone. Improved portability is achieved by limiting the size and power requirements of the unit, which in turn is achieved by limiting the volume of air in the box to be temperature-controlled, which in turn is achieved by more compact arrangement of samples within the box. Optionally, a free-standing roller base is provided so that all of the contents may be made available within arm's reach in more than one room. Better temperature stability is achieved by minimization of surface area, an improved door seal, and by better isolation of the compressor from the box. This also reduces the power requirements by preventing compressor heat from getting back into the box. Digital external temperature set point control (high-low temperature lock) and door ajar annunciators provide additional stability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Better sample integrity and retrievability is achieved by providing compartments specifically designed for alphanumeric or color-coded sequences of marked containers, such as vial boxes. One embodiment accomplishes this by utilizing a rectangular array of sliding trays, each tray of a width typical for individual vial boxes; another utilizes an array of bins arranged on a carousel, each bin of a width, depth, and height suitable for compact arrangement of individual vial boxes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings, in which like features in each drawing are represented by like reference characters, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective exterior view of the both embodiments of the invention. A substantially cubical cabinet <b>1</b> contains the refrigerated compartments (not visible in this view) and the motor, compressor, and evaporator coils (not visible) normally associated with refrigeration equipment. The cubical shape provides the least possible surface area for a substantially rectangular cabinet, minimizing heat transfer and maximizing efficiency from the standpoint of surface-to-volume ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cabinet <b>1</b> also contains a self-contained power supply (not visible). The cabinet <b>1</b> may (as shown), but is not required to, have slightly rounded sides to enable more insulation to be interposed between the cabinet and the refrigerated compartments. A main door <b>2</b> and a freezer door <b>3</b>, with handles <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively, provide access to main and freezer compartments, respectively. A pair of handles <b>6</b> (one visible) provides for manual lifting of the entire invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of a first embodiment of the invention (vertical section II-II&#x2032; or VI-VI&#x2032;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>). Cabinet <b>1</b> contains a thermally-insulated box <b>20</b>, which is subdivided into an upper (freezer) compartment <b>21</b> and a main (chilled) compartment <b>22</b>. The two subdivisions are insulated from each other by an insulated barrier <b>24</b>. Below the box <b>20</b> is a power compartment <b>25</b> containing a battery pack <b>26</b> and a compressor <b>27</b> along with electronic regulating circuitry. High-efficiency insulation <b>204</b> (e.g., rigid foam) is interposed between box <b>20</b>, cabinet <b>1</b>, and power compartment <b>25</b>. Also visible in this view are lifting handles <b>6</b> and feet <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Both the freezer compartment <b>21</b> and the chilled compartment <b>22</b> contain one or more tray support racks <b>28</b>. (In the depicted embodiment, the freezer compartment <b>21</b> contains two such racks, and the chilled compartment <b>22</b> contains four such racks). Each rack <b>28</b> supports a plurality of elongate trays <b>201</b> (in the depicted embodiment, five) extending from the front of the box to the back. The trays <b>201</b> are of a width to accommodate the long dimension of a standard vial box <b>203</b> (shown in dashed lines to indicate environmental structure).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of one of the trays <b>201</b> and a corresponding portion of a rack <b>28</b>, showing how each tray <b>201</b> is removably supported by a rack <b>28</b>. Each rack <b>28</b> is subdivided by upward-extending flanges <b>29</b> snugly fitting the width of each tray <b>201</b>. Thus each tray <b>201</b> may be accessed by pulling it forwardly out of the compartment. The trays <b>201</b> may be open at the top or optionally equipped with lids. Each tray may be appropriately labeled, such as on tray handle <b>30</b>, to provide rapid access to a particular vial.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the first embodiment (vertical section IV-IV&#x2032;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). It shows elongate trays <b>201</b> holding vial boxes <b>203</b> on racks <b>28</b>, which extend from near the front (left in this view) to the rear (right in this view) of compartments <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. The racks <b>28</b> are also fixed to the rear walls <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, respectively, of the compartments. Note also door seals <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top cross-sectional view of the first embodiment through a horizontal plane (section V-V&#x2032;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>). It shows the elongate trays <b>201</b> holding vial boxes <b>203</b> in chilled compartment <b>22</b>, as seen from above. In the depicted embodiment, fourteen vial boxes can be placed in each tray, with 2&#xd7;5&#xd7;14=140 in the freezer compartment and 4&#xd7;5&#xd7;14=280 in the chilled compartment, for a total of <b>420</b>. This Figure also shows a rack <b>28</b> attached to rear wall <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a front cross-sectional view of a second embodiment of the invention (vertical section VI-VI&#x2032;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This second embodiment differs from the first only in the arrangement of vial box storage in the chilled compartment <b>22</b>. Instead of employing elongate trays, this embodiment uses a plurality of bins <b>60</b> mounted on a carousel <b>61</b>, capable of being revolved manually about a capstan <b>62</b>. In this depiction, the carousel <b>61</b> comprises two levels <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>, although any number may be employed to suit the dimensions selected for the compartment. Each carousel level <b>63</b> or <b>64</b> may be rotated independently of the other. Although trays <b>201</b> are shown in freezer compartment <b>21</b> in this depiction of the second embodiment, carousels may be utilized optionally in the freezer compartment <b>21</b> as well as in the chilled compartment <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a top cross-sectional view of the second embodiment through a horizontal plane (section D-D&#x2032;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) more clearly showing the structure of the upper level carousel <b>63</b>. Here, eight bins <b>60</b> can be seen arrayed radially about capstan <b>62</b>. Each bin <b>60</b> is supported by a pair of capstan arms <b>80</b>, which arms are affixed to an octagonal plate <b>81</b>. Plate <b>81</b> in turn revolves on capstan <b>62</b>. The bins may be slid radially outward on each pair of arms <b>80</b> so that any vial box <b>203</b> may be easily accessed. The vials may be open at the top or optionally equipped with lids.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Sixteen bins are depicted here, each having a capacity of six vial boxes (three horizontally and two vertically). This allows the chilled compartment in this depiction of the second embodiment to store up to 16&#xd7;6=96 vial boxes. Each bin may be appropriately labeled to provide rapid access to a particular vial.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The carousel arrangement of the second embodiment creates more void space in the chilled compartment. Some of this space <b>82</b> may be utilized to provide additional battery capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of one of the bins <b>60</b> showing how it cooperates with a pair of capstan arms <b>80</b>. Each bin has a pair of horizontal glides <b>83</b> (only one being visible) affixed to its sides which are dimensioned to slide snugly over, and be supported by, capstan arms <b>80</b>. Male detents <b>84</b><i>a </i>or <b>84</b><i>b </i>within glide <b>83</b> can engage female detent <b>85</b> on arm <b>80</b> at either of two radial positions, depending on whether it is desired to hold bin <b>60</b> fully in against octagonal plate <b>81</b> or partially extended toward the compartment door. Optional bottom lip <b>86</b> on glide <b>83</b> prevents bin <b>60</b> from tipping forward on arm <b>80</b>. Bin <b>60</b> may be completely removed from arms <b>80</b>. An optional bell <b>87</b> (only one of two being visible) guides the end <b>88</b> of arm <b>80</b> into glide <b>83</b> when it is desired to reinstall bin <b>60</b> on arms <b>80</b>. An optional lid <b>89</b> is provided on bin <b>60</b>. This depiction of the second embodiment of the invention shows a bin capacity of six vial boxes <b>203</b> per bin.</p>
