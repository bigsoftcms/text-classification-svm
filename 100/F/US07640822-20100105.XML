<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 to Japanese Patent Application 2006-176515, filed on Jun. 27, 2006, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a resin-made worm wheel driven by a worm and a worm gear (worm speed reducer) having the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known worm wheel is disclosed in JP2002-310267A (hereinafter, refers to as a reference. The worm wheel is formed with resin and driven by a worm. The worm wheel is provided with: an engaging portion having a plurality of teeth engaged with the worm; and tooth spaces defined between the neighboring teeth and of which bottom surface is recessed radially inwardly. The worm wheel is structured by integrating two members divided perpendicularly to the axis thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally at a resin molding with a die, undercut is formed by tooth spaces when the bottom surfaces of each tooth space is recessed radially inwardly. If the amount of the undercut is large, it may be difficult to die-cut the worm wheel after molding the worm wheel in the die, which structures the worm wheel disclosed in this reference with two members.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The worm wheel disclosed in the reference needs to be structured by resin-molding two members separately and by bonding the two members perpendicularly along the axis direction, thus leading to an inevitable increase of man-hours to connect two members.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a worm wheel, which is not established with plural divided members, a resin base material of the worm wheel can be formed with toothed portions at a peripheral portion by cutting. However, the cutting work is not cost efficient and a certain improvement is considered to be necessary for this method from the viewpoint of productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides a resin worm wheel manufactured with improved productivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, a resin worm wheel is formed by injection molding and includes a first end and a second end. The worm wheel is adapted to be driven by a worm. The worm wheel further includes: an engaging portion including a plurality of teeth engageable with the worm and a tooth space formed between the neighboring teeth; a first non-engaging portion adjacent to the engaging portion at the first end of the worm wheel and not engaging with the worm; and a first cutout portion formed at the first non-engaging portion continuously from the tooth space. The first cutout portion extends axially.</p>

The tooth spaces <b>14</b> are only partially attached with reference numerals in the drawing figures. As illustrated in the drawings, the middle portion of the each tooth space is deep and becomes shallower as approaching to an end of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. The non-engaging portions <b>12</b> are formed at both ends of the worm wheel <b>10</b> so as to adjoin the engaging portion <b>11</b>. The non-engaging portions <b>12</b> do not engage with the worm <b>20</b> and do not come in contact therewith. According to the embodiment, the non-engaging portion <b>12</b> is formed with a plurality of cutout portions <b>15</b> (a first cutout portion and a second cutout portion, the cutout portions <b>15</b> are only partially attached with reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). Each cutout portion <b>15</b> is continuously formed through an end of the tooth spaces <b>14</b> and extends to an end surface <b>16</b> of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the cutout portion <b>15</b> has a circumferential length smaller than the one of the tooth space <b>14</b>. Further, the cutout portion <b>15</b> can be shaped in any ways as far as the cutout portion <b>15</b> is less undercut and a rigidity of the worm wheel <b>10</b> is not damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the embodiment shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cutout portions <b>15</b> are provided at one of the non-engaging portions <b>12</b> provided at both ends of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cutout portions <b>15</b> can be provided at both of the non-engaging portions <b>12</b> provided at both ends of the worm wheel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the embodiment shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the worm wheel <b>10</b> includes a ring-shaped reinforcement member <b>30</b> (a first ring-shaped reinforcement member and a second ring-shaped reinforcement member). The reinforcement member <b>30</b> is formed with insertion portions <b>31</b>, which are adjusted to be inserted into the cutout portions <b>15</b> respectively and are attached to an end surface of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. The cutout portions <b>15</b> are equally spaced in the circumferential direction of the worm wheel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is preferable that the insertion portions <b>31</b> protrude at one surface of the ring-shaped reinforcement member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The reinforcement member <b>30</b> is formed separately from the worm wheel <b>10</b> by injection molding. The reinforcement member <b>30</b> is ring-shaped, having a hole <b>32</b> at the center thereof, and is provided with the insertion portions <b>31</b> that are equally spaced in the circumferential direction (the insertion portion <b>31</b> are only partially attached with reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the insertion portions <b>31</b> are inserted into the cutout portions <b>15</b> of the worm wheel <b>10</b> in a situation where boss portions <b>17</b>, which are formed at both ends of the worm wheel along an axis <b>18</b>, are inserted into the holes <b>32</b>. As aforementioned, the reinforcement member <b>30</b> can improve strength of the worm wheel <b>10</b> by the insertion portions <b>31</b> inserted into the cutout portions <b>15</b> of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. The reinforcement member <b>30</b> can be applied to both ends of a helical gear <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The reinforcement member <b>30</b> can be made from resin or metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As an embodiment of present invention, the worm gear <b>1</b> can include a helical gear <b>40</b> instead of the worm wheel <b>10</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described above, the worm wheel <b>10</b> and the worm wheel <b>10</b> configuring the worm gear <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, each includes cutout portions, which are provided at the non-engaging portions <b>12</b> and are formed continuously through the tooth spaces <b>14</b> extending to the axial direction of the worm wheel <b>10</b>. With this structure, the amount of the undercut will be reduced and it can be easier to die-cut the worm wheel <b>10</b> after resin molding. Accordingly, according to the embodiment, the worm wheel <b>10</b> does not include a block configuration and is entirely formed by thereof is formed by resin molding, which enhances productivity of the worm wheel <b>10</b> (worm gear <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is preferable that the first cutout portion extends into an end surface of the first end of the worm wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is further preferable that the resin worm wheel further includes a second non-engaging portion adjacent to the engaging portion at the second end of the worm wheel and not engaging with the worm. The first cutout portion is formed at the first non-engaging portion and a second cutout portion is formed at the second non-engaging portion.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is still further preferable that the worm wheel further includes a first ring-shaped reinforcement member having at least one insertion portion fitted into the first cutout portion and attached to the end of the worm wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is preferable that the insertion portion of the first ring-shaped reinforcement member includes multiple protrusions provided at one surface of the first ring-shaped reinforcement member.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is still further preferable that the worm wheel and the worm structures a worm gear.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the worm wheel and the worm wheel configuring the worm gear is each provided with the non-engaging portion. The worm wheel is formed with cutout portions formed continuously from the tooth space and extending axially. In such structure, because the amount of undercut by the tooth space is reduced, the worm wheel is easily die-cut from a die. As a result, the entire body of the worm wheel is formed in one operation by injection molding, which leads to an improvement in productivity of the worm wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The principles, of the preferred embodiment and mode of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. However, the invention, which is intended to be protected, is not to be construed as limited to the particular embodiment disclosed.
