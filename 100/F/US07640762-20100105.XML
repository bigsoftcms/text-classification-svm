<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. National stage application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-313439, filed in Japan on Sep. 5, 2003 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a refrigeration apparatus in which, for example, a compressor, a condenser, an expansion part and an evaporator are connected to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional refrigeration apparatus, a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator are connected to one another in a loop, where a supercooling-use heat exchanger is placed between the condenser and the expansion valve. Then, a liquid refrigerant derived from the condenser is branched into two flows. One flow of the liquid refrigerant makes a main flow liquid, while the other flow of the liquid refrigerant, after passing through the supercooling-use heat exchanger, super-cools the main flow liquid via the supercooling-use heat exchanger, then being led to the compression chamber of the compressor (see, for example, JP H11-248264 A).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the prior art refrigeration apparatus is incapable of further increasing the degree of liquid supercooling of the refrigerant immediately before the expansion valve. Thus, there have been limitations in improving the refrigerating capacity and energy efficiency (COP).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a refrigeration apparatus which is capable of further increasing the degree of liquid supercooling of the refrigerant immediately before the expansion part, thus enabled to improve the refrigerating capacity and energy efficiency (COP).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the objects, the refrigeration apparatus includes:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">a compressor;</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a condenser;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">an expansion part; and</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">an evaporator,</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">wherein the compressor, the condenser, the expansion part and the evaporator are connected to one another in order,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">the refrigeration apparatus further includes:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least two sub passages which are branched from a main passage located between the condenser and the expansion part and which are connected to the compressor;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">supercooling-use expansion parts provided on the sub passages, respectively; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">supercooling-use heat exchangers for performing heat exchange between a refrigerant on an outlet side of the supercooling-use expansion part and a refrigerant of the main passage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this refrigeration apparatus of the invention, since the supercooling-use heat exchanger is provided at least two in number along the main passage, the degree of liquid supercooling (SC) can be increased each time the refrigerant of the main passage passes through the plurality of supercooling-use heat exchangers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">That is, since the refrigeration apparatus of this invention has a so-called three- or more-stage expansion economizer cycle, the degree of liquid supercooling of the refrigerant immediately before the expansion part can be further increased so that the refrigerating capacity and energy efficiency (COP) can be further improved, as compared with prior-art refrigeration apparatuses having a two-stage expansion economizer cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in the refrigeration apparatus of one embodiment, the compressor is a single screw compressor including a screw rotor and a pair of gate rotors which mesh with the screw rotor so as to sandwich the screw rotor from both sides, and the sub passages are provided two in number,</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">one of the sub passages being connected to one side of a boundary defined by the pair of gate rotors, and the other of the sub passages being connected to the other side of the boundary defined by the pair of gate rotors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the refrigeration apparatus of this one embodiment, since the sub passage and the supercooling-use heat exchanger are provided two in number, an economizer cycle can be applied to each of compression spaces divided by an boundary defined by the pair of gate rotors in the compressor. Thus, a so-called three-stage expansion economizer cycle becomes applicable, so that performance improvement can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, in the refrigeration apparatus of one embodiment, the refrigeration apparatus includes:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">a discharge-side supercooling control section for detecting temperature and pressure of the refrigerant on the discharge side of the compressor and, based on a result of the detection, performing control of an opening degree of the supercooling-use expansion part in one of the sub passages; and</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">a suction-side supercooling control section for detecting temperature and pressure of the refrigerant on the suction side of the compressor in the other sub passage and, based on a result of the detection, performing control of an opening degree of the supercooling-use expansion part in the other sub passage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the refrigeration apparatus of this one embodiment, since one of the supercooling-use expansion parts is controlled by the discharge-side supercooling control section while the other supercooling-use expansion part is controlled by the suction-side supercooling control section, the two supercooling-use expansion parts can be controlled based on different temperatures and pressures, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Consequently, in the two supercooling-use expansion parts, hunting of the opening and closing operations due to control exerted based on a common temperature and pressure can be avoided so that a stable cooling effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the refrigeration apparatus of the present invention, since the supercooling-use heat exchanger is provided at least two in number along the main passage, the degree of liquid supercooling of the refrigerant immediately before the expansion part can be increased so that the refrigerating capacity and energy efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Also, according to the refrigeration apparatus of one embodiment, since the economizer cycle is applied to each of the divisional compression spaces of the compressor, performance improvement can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also, according to the refrigeration apparatus of one embodiment, since the two supercooling-use expansion parts are controlled based on different temperatures and pressures, respectively, competition of the opening and closing operations between the two supercooling-use expansion parts can be prevented so that a stable cooling effect can be obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail by embodiments thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified configurational view showing an embodiment of the refrigeration apparatus of the invention. In this refrigeration apparatus, a compressor <b>1</b>, a condenser <b>2</b>, an expansion part <b>3</b> and an evaporator <b>4</b> are connected to one another in a loop, constituting a refrigeration cycle using a refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This refrigeration cycle is explained. A vapor phase refrigerant discharged by the compressor <b>1</b> has its heat absorbed in the condenser <b>2</b>, resulting in a liquid phase state. The resulting liquid phase refrigerant is decompressed by the expansion part <b>3</b>, resulting in a two-phase state of vapor phase and liquid phase. Thereafter, the two-phase refrigerant (wet gas) has heat imparted in the evaporator <b>4</b>, resulting in a vapor phase state. The resulting vapor phase refrigerant is sucked and pressurized in the compressor <b>1</b>, and then discharged in the compressor <b>1</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the compressor <b>1</b>, for example, a single screw compressor is used. In more detail, the compressor <b>1</b> includes a screw rotor <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and a pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>which meshes with the screw rotor <b>1</b><i>a </i>so as to sandwich the same from both sides. Meshing between a thread groove of the screw rotor <b>1</b><i>a </i>and tooth portions of the one pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>defines the compression chamber, and the refrigerant is compressed to high pressure in the compression chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The condenser <b>2</b> includes a fan <b>7</b>, and the refrigerant is cooled by air cooling of the fan <b>7</b>. The expansion part <b>3</b> is given by using, for example, an electronically controlled expansion valve or a capillary tube. The evaporator <b>4</b> is given by using, for example, a heat exchanger for cooling water (liquid heat transfer medium) by the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, this refrigeration apparatus has two sub passages <b>11</b>, <b>11</b> which are branched from a main passage <b>10</b> between the condenser <b>2</b> and the expansion part <b>3</b> and connected to the compressor <b>1</b>. It is noted that the main passage <b>10</b> and the sub passages <b>11</b> are implemented by piping.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">More specifically, by the branch from upstream and downstream sides of the main passage <b>10</b>, an upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> and a downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> are formed. This upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> is connected to one side of the pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which are assumed as a boundary, while the downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> is connected to the other side of the pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>assumed as the boundary. That is, the upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> communicates with a midway portion of the compression chamber located on one side of the boundary given by the pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, while the downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> communicates with a midway portion of the compression chamber located on the other side of the boundary given by the pair of gate rotors <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, a supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> and a supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b> for performing heat exchange between the refrigerant on the outlet side of the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> and the refrigerant of the main passage <b>10</b> are provided on each of these sub passages <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, an upstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger (higher-stage economizer) <b>13</b> and a downstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger (lower-stage economizer) <b>13</b> are set along the main passage <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although the sub passages <b>11</b> are branched from the main passage <b>10</b> on the downstream side of the supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>, yet those sub passages <b>11</b> may also be branched from the main passage <b>10</b> on the upstream side of the supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, operation of the two supercooling-use heat exchangers <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> is explained. The liquid phase refrigerant in the main passage <b>10</b>, coming from the condenser <b>2</b>, is first diverged to the upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b>. This liquid phase refrigerant in the upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> is decompressed by the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b>, resulting in a two-phase refrigerant of vapor phase and liquid phase. The resulting two-phase refrigerant absorbs heat from the liquid phase refrigerant of the main passage <b>10</b> via the upstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>, resulting in a vapor phase refrigerant. The resulting vapor phase refrigerant is sucked into the compressor <b>1</b>. In this process, the liquid phase refrigerant in the main passage <b>10</b> is cooled via the upstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thereafter, the cooled liquid phase refrigerant in the main passage <b>10</b> is diverged to the downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b>. The liquid phase refrigerant in the downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> is decompressed in the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b>, resulting in a two-phase refrigerant of vapor phase and liquid phase. The resulting two-phase refrigerant absorbs heat from the liquid phase refrigerant of the main passage <b>10</b> via the downstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>, resulting in a vapor phase refrigerant. The resulting vapor phase refrigerant is sucked into the compressor <b>1</b>. In this process, the liquid phase refrigerant in the main passage <b>10</b> is cooled via the downstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the refrigeration apparatus having the above-described construction, since the two supercooling-use heat exchangers <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> are provided, the refrigerant of the main passage <b>10</b> can be increased in the degree of liquid supercooling each time it passes through the two supercooling-use heat exchangers <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">That is, the refrigeration apparatus of this invention, by virtue of its having a three-stage expansion economizer cycle made up of the three expansion parts <b>3</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> and the two supercooling-use heat exchangers <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>, can be increased in the degree of liquid supercooling for the refrigerant immediately before the expansion part <b>3</b>, thus capable of further improving the refrigerating capacity and energy efficiency (COP), as compared with the prior-art refrigeration apparatus having a two-stage expansion economizer cycle made up of two expansion valves and one supercooling-use heat exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the refrigeration apparatus of the invention (three-stage expansion) indicated by solid line, the degree of liquid supercooling (SC) is increased by the upstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger (upper stage of three-stage expansion ECO) and the downstream-side supercooling-use heat exchanger (lower stage of three-stage expansion ECO) so that the refrigerating capacity is improved, as compared with the refrigeration apparatus of the prior art (two-stage expansion) indicated by broken line.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, the refrigeration apparatus of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, further includes a discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b> for detecting temperature and pressure of the refrigerant on the discharge side of the compressor <b>1</b> and, based on a result of the detection, performing control of the opening degree of the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> in the downstream, and a suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b> for detecting temperature and pressure of the refrigerant on the suction side of the compressor <b>1</b> in the upstream-side sub passage <b>11</b> and, based on a result of the detection, performing control of the opening degree of the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> in the upstream.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b> performs the opening degree control by calculating a present-time current SH value from a temperature and a high-pressure pressure value of the refrigerant within discharge piping of the compressor <b>1</b> and then comparing the obtained value with a previously set target SH value. The suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b> performs the opening degree control by calculating a present-time current SH value from a temperature and a pressure value of the refrigerant within outlet piping of the upstream-side supercooling-use heat exchangers <b>13</b> and then comparing the obtained value with a previously set target SH value. It is noted here that the SH value refers to a degree of superheat, which is a temperature showing a difference from the temperature of a saturated state.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is provided by using a temperature-sensitive expansion valve, thus allowing its price to be lowered as compared with the electronic expansion valve. Of course, an electronic expansion valve may also be used as the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, operations of the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b> and the suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b> are explained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">First, control operation by the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b> is described. As the control operation starts (S<b>101</b>), it is decided whether or not the current SH value (B) is greater than the target SH value (A) (S<b>102</b>). If it is greater, the control section <b>14</b> opens the downstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>103</b>). Conversely, if it is not greater, it is decided whether or not the current SH value (B) is smaller than the target SH value (A) (S<b>104</b>). Then, if it is smaller, the control section <b>14</b> closes the downstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>105</b>). Conversely, if it is not smaller, the control section <b>14</b> does not perform any operation for the downstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, control operation by the suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b> is described. As the control operation starts (S<b>201</b>), it is decided whether or not the current SH value (D) is greater than the target SH value (C) (S<b>202</b>). If it is greater, the control section <b>15</b> opens the upstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>203</b>). Conversely, if it is not greater, it is decided whether or not the current SH value (D) is smaller than the target SH value (C) (S<b>204</b>). Then, if it is smaller, the control section <b>15</b> closes the upstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>205</b>). Conversely, if it is not smaller, the control section <b>15</b> does not perform any operation for the upstream-side temperature-sensitive expansion valve <b>12</b> (S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown above, the downstream-side supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is controlled by the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b>, while the upstream-side supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is controlled by the suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b>. Therefore, the two supercooling-use expansion parts <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> can be controlled based on different temperatures and pressures, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, in the two supercooling-use expansion parts <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>, hunting of the opening and closing operations due to control exerted based on a common temperature and pressure can be avoided so that a stable cooling effect can be obtained. For instance, in a case where the two supercooling-use expansion parts <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> are controlled by the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b>, the two supercooling-use expansion parts <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> are controlled by a common pressure and temperature, so that the opening and closing operations may undergo occurrence of hunting, where a stable cooling effect could not be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Without being limited to the above-described embodiment, the present invention may be subject to design changes within the scope of the invention unless they depart therefrom. It is also possible, for example, that upstream-side supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is controlled by the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b> while the downstream-side supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is controlled by the suction-side supercooling control section <b>15</b> additionally provided on the downstream-side sub passage <b>11</b>. Also, the sub passage <b>11</b>, the supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> and the supercooling-use heat exchanger <b>13</b> may be provided each three or more in number, in which case one supercooling-use expansion part <b>12</b> is controlled by the discharge-side supercooling control section <b>14</b>, and the other supercooling-use expansion parts <b>12</b> are controlled by the suction-side supercooling control sections <b>15</b> provided on the sub passages <b>11</b>, respectively.</p>
