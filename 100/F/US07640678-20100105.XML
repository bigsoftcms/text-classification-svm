<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a dryer, and more particularly, to a laundry dryer with a structure for preventing impurities such as lint from entering the drying drum together with outside air.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A drum dryer is a home appliance that dries laundry by circulating hot, dry air within a drying drum to dry laundry inserted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Drum dryers are divided into condenser dryers that circulate air between the drying drum and a heater to dry laundry inside the drum, and vented dryers that direct air heated by a heater into the drying drum to dry laundry, after which the air is exhausted from the drying drum to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In further detail, in a vented dryer, air that has been heated while passing through a heater flows into the drum, and then leaves the drum by passing through a lint filter installed at the front of the drum, removing it of lint. The air that passes through the lint filter then flows through an exhaust assembly formed at the bottom of the dryer, to be exhausted to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a vented dryer, air from outside the dryer enters the drying drum through an intake, and after the air in the drying drum dries the laundry therein, it is exhausted to the outside. However, in the related art, where air is drawn into the drum from outside the dryer, there is a need to prevent dust and lint from entering the drum. In other words, impurities in the outside air that enters the drum through the intake can contaminate laundry in the drum.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a laundry dryer that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a laundry dryer with an impurity entry preventing structure that blocks the entry of impurities such as lint and dust into the drying drum through an outside air intake connected to the rear of the drum.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a laundry dryer including: a drying drum for inserting laundry in; a base including an outside air intake port for suctioning indoor air, an air passage for moist air from the drying drum to pass through, and an impurity descending slot recessed a predetermined depth at a front of the outside air intake port for impurities to fall into; and a cabinet enclosing the drying drum and the base.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a laundry dryer including: a cabinet; a drying drum disposed within the cabinet; a base disposed within the cabinet, and including: a lower base having an outside air intake port for suctioning indoor air and an impurity separating slot for separating impurities from air entering the outside air intake port; and an upper base coupled at a top of the lower base; and a lint cap formed in the outside air intake port, for filtering impurities in a second stage that have not been separated by the impurity separating slot.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a laundry dryer including: a cabinet; a drying drum disposed within the cabinet; a lower base installed below the drying drum, and including an outside air intake port for suctioning indoor air, a lint entry preventing member permanently or detachably installed to the outside air intake port, and an air passage for guiding a flow of moist air from the drying drum; and an upper base coupled at a top of the lower base, for covering the air passage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a laundry dryer including: a drying drum; a lower base installed below the drying drum, and including an outside air intake port for suctioning indoor air and a recessed portion for preventing comparatively heavy impurities contained in the indoor air from passing through the outside air intake port and accumulating the impurities; and an upper base coupled at a top of the lower base; and a lint blocking member permanently or detachably coupled to the outside air intake port, for preventing impurities from entering the drying drum through the outside air intake port.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the laundry dryer having the above impurity entry preventing structure according to the present invention, the entry of impurities such as lint or dust (along with outer air) into the drying drum during a drying cycle can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a laundry dryer according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a dryer <b>10</b> with a passage structure according to the present invention includes a drying drum <b>14</b> for putting laundry into, a cabinet <b>11</b> installed outside the drying drum <b>14</b> for protecting the drying drum <b>14</b>, a base <b>20</b> installed below the drying drum <b>14</b> and having an air exhaust duct formed within, and a motor <b>15</b> mounted on the upper portion of the base <b>20</b> for rotating the drying drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In more detail, the cabinet <b>11</b> includes a front cover <b>111</b> for supporting the front portion of the drying drum <b>14</b>, a side cover <b>112</b> installed on the side of the drying drum <b>14</b>, and a back cover <b>114</b> supporting the rear of the drying drum <b>14</b>, and a top cover <b>113</b> at a top of the drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The dryer <b>10</b> also includes a door <b>12</b> pivotably installed at the front of the front cover <b>111</b> to open and close the opening at the front of the drying drum <b>14</b> for inserting and extracting laundry, a control panel <b>13</b> installed above the door <b>12</b> and having buttons for inputting dryer settings and operation, a drying duct <b>17</b> installed at the rear of the back cover <b>114</b> to guide outside air into the drying drum, and a heater <b>16</b> installed inside the drying duct <b>17</b> to heat the outside air drawn in.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The operation of the above-described dryer <b>10</b> will now be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First, a user opens the door <b>12</b> and inserts laundry into the drying drum <b>14</b>. Then, using the setting portion on the control panel <b>13</b>, the user inputs dryer settings. When the start button is pressed, the motor <b>15</b> and the heater <b>16</b> installed inside the drying duct <b>17</b> operate. A suctioning blower installed below the base <b>20</b> rotates to suction outside air into the dryer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In more detail, outside air enters the drying duct <b>17</b> through an outside air intake port (described later) formed at the bottom of the back cover <b>114</b>, and is heated while passing through the drying duct <b>17</b>. The heated air enters the drying drum <b>14</b> through a rear wall of the drying drum <b>14</b>. The heated air that enters the drying drum <b>14</b> absorbs moisture imbued in laundry and becomes hot, moist air. The air that becomes hot and moist leaves the drying drum <b>14</b> by passing through a lint filter (not shown) formed on the front cover <b>111</b>, shedding impurities such as lint in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The air that passes through the lint filter flows along the exhaust passage (described below) installed on the base <b>20</b>, and is ultimately exhausted out from the dryer <b>10</b>. Here, the base <b>20</b> forms a passage within for air to be exhausted, and exhaust ports are formed on the sides and rear of the base <b>20</b>. One of the exhaust ports may be open while the remaining ports may be sealed. The air passage formed within the base <b>20</b> will be described in further detail below with reference to the diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a base installed in a dryer according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the base <b>20</b> of the dryer according to the present invention includes a lower base <b>21</b> and an upper base <b>22</b> mounted on top of the lower base <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In detail, the motor <b>15</b> is mounted on top of the lower base <b>21</b>, and the passage for exhausting air is formed within the upper part of the lower base <b>21</b>. The upper base <b>22</b> covers the air passage, so that the exhausting air is not dispelled but directed to flow in a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In further detail, the lower base <b>21</b> and the upper base <b>22</b> are respectively plastic injection molded and coupled together in one piece by means of fasteners. However, the manufacturing method of the base <b>20</b> is not limited thereto, and may include being formed in a single piece. A drum connecting passage <b>203</b> is formed at the front upper portion of the base <b>20</b>, and a side exhaust port <b>201</b> is formed at the side and a rear exhaust port <b>202</b> is formed at the rear of the base <b>20</b>. The motor <b>15</b> is mounted to one side on top of the base <b>20</b>, and a blower is connected to the rotating motor shaft to suction air from inside the drum. The blower is protected by a blower cover <b>23</b>. Here, the blower is installed at the front of the motor <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, a suctioning blower (installed at the rear of the base <b>20</b> and not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is attached to and operates by means of a separate motor.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the above-described structure, the hot, moist discharged from the front of the drying drum <b>14</b> enters the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> and is exhausted back to the outside through the side exhaust port <b>201</b> and/or the rear exhaust port <b>202</b>. Below, a detailed description of the air passages formed within the base <b>20</b> will be given, with reference to the diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a lower base according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base <b>20</b> according to the present invention, as described above, includes a lower base <b>21</b> and an upper base <b>22</b> mounted on top of the lower base <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In detail, an air passage, through which air is exhausted from the drying drum <b>14</b>, is formed in the lower base. A complete air passage is formed by covering the bottom half of the air passage with the upper base <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In more detail, a drum air descending passage <b>205</b>, for the air passing from the drying drum <b>14</b> to descend, is formed at the front of the lower base <b>21</b>. A blower entrance <b>206</b> is formed on one side of the drum air descending passage <b>205</b> for the descending air to be suctioned toward the blower. A blower compartment <b>211</b> is formed for mounting the blower at the blower entrance <b>206</b>. An expanded passage portion <b>212</b> that bends at a predetermined angle and expands in diameter is connected to an end of the blower compartment <b>211</b>. A main passage <b>213</b> that extends to the rear end of the base lower unit <b>21</b> is connected at the end of the expanded passage portion <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A sub passage <b>214</b> is formed to intersect with the main passage <b>213</b>, forming the side exhaust ports <b>201</b> at either side of the lower base <b>21</b>. A condensation pan <b>214</b><i>a </i>is respectively formed a predetermined depth into the floors at the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> and side exhaust ports <b>201</b>, to collect condensing moisture from the exhausting air. A passage intersection <b>215</b> of the main passage <b>213</b> and the sub passage <b>214</b> is biased toward the rear of the lower base <b>21</b> from its center. That is, the sub passage <b>214</b> is closer to the rear of the lower base <b>21</b> than its front.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At least one upper base guiding protrusion <b>217</b> is formed on the top surface of the lower base <b>21</b>, in order to guide the mounting position of the upper base <b>22</b> over the lower base <b>21</b>. A fastening hook <b>219</b> is formed to protrude a predetermined height from along the perimeters of the main and sub passages <b>213</b> and <b>214</b>, in order to tightly couple the upper base <b>22</b> to the lower base <b>21</b>. Also, a plurality of fastening holes <b>216</b> are formed in the upper surface of the lower base <b>21</b>, so that a fastening member (for fastening the upper base <b>22</b>) can insert through the fastening hole <b>216</b>. Specifically, the fastening holes <b>216</b> are formed symmetrically at the edges on either sides of the sub and main passages <b>214</b> and <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An outside air intake port <b>204</b> is formed at the rear of the lower base <b>21</b>, to allow outside air to pass through the drying duct <b>17</b> into the drying drum. A lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>, or impurity descending slot <b>207</b>, for collecting impurities such as lint in the outside air suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>, is recessed a predetermined depth at the front of the outside air intake port <b>204</b>. An intake blower for suctioning outside air is installed to the outside of the outside air intake port <b>204</b>. Here, the outside air suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> is air within the cabinet <b>11</b> of the dryer <b>10</b>. A lint entry preventing ledge <b>218</b> is formed to protrude from around the perimeter of the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>. A detailed description of the lint entry preventing structure will be given below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A motor mount <b>215</b><i>a </i>for mounting the motor <b>15</b> is formed in the space between the blower compartment <b>211</b> and the sub passage <b>214</b>, where a motor supporting insert slot <b>215</b><i>b </i>is formed for supporting a motor supporter (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the above structure, the hot, moist air that descends through the drum air descending passage <b>205</b> flows through the blower entrance <b>206</b> into the blower compartment <b>211</b>. The air that enters the blower compartment <b>211</b> flows through the expanded passage portion <b>212</b> to the main passage <b>213</b>. The air that flows to the main passage <b>213</b> branches at the passage intersection <b>215</b> and flows through at least one of the side exhaust ports <b>201</b> and/or the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Here, a portion of the two side exhaust ports <b>201</b> and the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> may be sealed with caps. For example, if the dryer <b>10</b> is installed in a corner, one of the side exhaust ports <b>201</b> and the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> may sealed with caps, with only the remaining side exhaust port <b>201</b> opened. That is to say that caps can be used to selectively seal the exhaust ports, as mandated by the installed location of the dryer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The air that flows toward the sealed exhaust ports during the circulation through the passages condenses, and the condensed water accumulates in the condensation pans <b>214</b><i>a</i>. Also, even when all the exhaust ports <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are open, air that flows through the passages condenses, whereupon the condensed water accumulates in the condensation pans <b>214</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of an upper base according to the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view of the bottom of the upper base in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the upper base <b>22</b> according to the present invention, as described above, is mounted on top of the lower base <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Specifically, the upper base <b>22</b> is formed in a shape corresponding to that of the lower base <b>21</b> in terms of the passages, in order to seal the upper portion of the passages. A drum connecting passage <b>203</b> is formed at the front of the upper base <b>22</b>, to provide an entrance for hot, moist air exiting the drying drum <b>14</b> toward the passages.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In more detail, the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> extends a predetermined distance upward from the top of the upper base <b>22</b> to form the interior of a drum connecting duct <b>221</b>. A blower connecting portion <b>221</b><i>a </i>is formed to extend from the side of the drum connecting duct <b>221</b>, so that air passes through the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> and flows into the blower entrance <b>206</b> formed in the lower base <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A main passage cover <b>222</b> and a sub passage cover <b>223</b> are formed on the upper base <b>22</b> to cover the expanded passage portion <b>212</b>, the main passage <b>213</b>, and the sub passage <b>214</b> formed in the lower base <b>21</b>. The main passage cover <b>222</b> and the sub passage cover <b>223</b> also intersect with each other. A humidity sensor mount <b>226</b> is formed in a portion of the main passage cover <b>222</b> for installing a humidity sensor therein, in order to detect the level of humidity of air flowing through the main passage <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hook insert holes <b>225</b> are formed along the lower perimeter of the main passage cover <b>222</b> and the sub passage cover <b>223</b>, so that the fastening hooks <b>219</b> separated from one another by a predetermined distance on the lower base <b>21</b> can insert into the hook insert holes <b>225</b>. A fastening tab <b>224</b>, for tightly coupling the upper base <b>22</b> on the lower base <b>21</b>, is formed respectively on either side at both ends of the sub passage cover <b>223</b> and on either side of the main passage cover <b>222</b>. Specifically, a fastening hole <b>224</b><i>a </i>is formed in each fastening tab <b>224</b>, so that a fastening member inserted through the fastening hole <b>224</b><i>a </i>inserts into the fastening hole <b>216</b> formed in the lower base <b>21</b>. That is, the fastening member tightens the coupling of the upper base <b>22</b> to the lower base <b>21</b>, so that no gaps are formed between the base upper and lower portions <b>22</b> and <b>21</b>. In this way, the size of gaps formed between the base upper and lower portions <b>22</b> and <b>21</b> may be minimized, preventing leakage of air flowing within the passages and the possibility of it re-entering through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>. In other words, the air flowing through the inside of the passages is prevented from leaking into the interior space of the cabinet <b>11</b> holding the drying drum <b>14</b> and being suctioned into the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the above structure, the hot, moist air that exits the drying drum <b>14</b> passes through the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> and descends to the drum air descending passage <b>205</b>. The air that descends to the drum air descending passage <b>205</b> flows to the blower entrance <b>206</b>. The air that descends to the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> flows along the blower connecting portion <b>221</b><i>a </i>and into the blower entrance <b>206</b>. The air that enters the blower entrance <b>206</b> moves through the expanded passage portion <b>212</b>, the main passage <b>213</b>, and the sub passages <b>214</b>. The air that flows through the main and sub passages <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> condenses and is exhausted to the outside through the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> and/or the side exhaust port(s) <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing airflow within a base according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as described above, the air that passes through the drying drum <b>14</b> passes through the lint filter installed in the front cover <b>111</b> to shed impurities in a first stage, and then descends through the drum connecting passage <b>203</b>. Then, the air that descends through the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> moves to the blower entrance <b>206</b> formed at the end of the blower connecting portion <b>221</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The air that moves to the blower entrance <b>206</b> is redirected by the blower installed in the blower compartment <b>211</b>. The air that is redirected by the blower flows to the expanded passage portion <b>212</b>. The flow direction of the air is redirected again at the expanded passage portion <b>212</b> to the main passage <b>213</b>, and the air flows to the rear of the base <b>20</b>. A portion of the air flowing through the main passage <b>213</b> branches off at the passage intersection <b>215</b> (where the main and sub passages <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> intersect) to the sub passages <b>214</b>. The air flowing through the main and sub passages <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> flow through the rear exhaust port <b>202</b> and/or side exhaust port(s) <b>201</b> to be exhausted back to the outside. Here, the hot, moist air that exits the drying drum <b>14</b> cools (and a portion of the moisture in the air condenses) during the time it takes to flow from the drum connecting passage <b>203</b> to the exhaust ports <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. The condensed moisture accumulates in the condensation pans <b>214</b><i>a </i>recessed in the floors of the main and sub passages <b>213</b> and <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The outside air that flows into the rear of drying drum <b>14</b>, that is, outside air with the same temperature and humidity of inside air, re-enters the drying drum <b>14</b> through the drying duct <b>17</b> through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> formed at the rear of the base <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of an impurity entry preventing structure in a dryer according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, as briefly addressed above, a lint entry preventing ledge <b>218</b> and a lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b> are formed to prevent impurities from entering through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">More specifically, the air suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> is inner air inside the cabinet <b>11</b> of the dryer <b>10</b>. However, the inner air entering through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> may mix with small quantities of hot, moist air that leaks through small gaps in the coupling regions between the base upper and lower portions <b>22</b> and <b>21</b>. Also, lint that may escape from the drying drum <b>14</b> may mix with the air moving through the passages. However, due to the lint entry preventing ledge <b>218</b> that protrudes a predetermined height along the perimeter of the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>, impurities escaping from a gap formed between the upper base <b>22</b> and the lower base <b>21</b> is prevented in a first stage. The air that is filtered in the first stage by the lint entry preventing ledge <b>218</b> is filtered again by the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In detail, impurities contained in outside air that enters through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> accumulates in the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>, to reduce the impurities entering into the drying duct <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In further detail, the outside air that is suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> swirls in the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>, so that the lint and other impurities contained in the air is deposited on the floor of the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>. The outside air intake port <b>204</b> is formed to be higher than the floor of the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>, to prevent the impurities deposited on the floor of the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b> from easily entering through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of a base with an impurity entry preventing device installed on its outside air intake port according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a grated grill <b>300</b> window with a predetermined diameter is installed on the outside air intake port <b>204</b>, to partition the latter into a plurality of small slots. Here, the bars of the grill <b>300</b> may be formed in a vertical or a horizontal direction. The distances between the grill <b>300</b> bars may be adjusted to effectively filter impurities. However, if the gaps between the bars are excessively narrow, suctioning force can decrease, and a load on the motor <b>15</b> can increase so that more energy is consumed. Therefore, an adequate gap should be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment of the grill <b>300</b>, a net may be formed on the grill. Specifically, a grill that intersects in vertical and horizontal directions may be formed to filter small lint particles and other impurities in air suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The grill <b>300</b> may be integrally formed with the lower base <b>21</b> through plastic injection molding for the sake of favorable manufacturing process and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the above structure, air that is suctioned through the outside air intake port <b>204</b> is filtered of impurities in a first stage by the lint entry preventing ledge <b>218</b> and in a second stage by the lint entry preventing slot <b>207</b>. The impurities are filtered in yet another stage by the grill <b>300</b>, so that a filtering in three stages occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> are perspective views of a lower base with an impurity entry preventing device installed on its outside air intake port according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a base <b>20</b>, of a dryer having an impurity entry preventing structure according to the present invention, includes an installed lint cap <b>320</b> for preventing impurities from passing through the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Specifically, the lint cap <b>320</b> has a cap body <b>321</b> that is inserted into the outside air intake port <b>204</b>, and a mesh <b>322</b> installed-within the cap body <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">More specifically, the mesh <b>322</b> forms fine holes that filter lint and other impurities, preventing them from entering the outside air intake port <b>204</b>. To remove impurities from the mesh <b>322</b>, the lint cap <b>320</b> may be detached from the outside air intake port <b>204</b>, and the impurities imbedded in the mesh <b>322</b> may be shaken or washed off with water. Also, in order to minimize deformation of the mesh <b>322</b> and increase its durability, it may be formed of a metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, the cap body <b>321</b> and the mesh <b>322</b> may be integrally formed through insert injection molding. That is, the metal mesh <b>322</b> may be covered around its edge with a mold in the shape of the cap body <b>321</b>, into which a plastic material is injected, thus forming the lint cap <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the mesh <b>322</b> may be permanently fixed on the outside air intake port <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other words, the mesh <b>322</b> may be fixed to the outside air intake port <b>204</b> during the injection molding of the lower base <b>21</b> so that it is integrally formed with the lower base <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the above structure, the outside air entering the outside air intake port <b>204</b> can be effectively removed of small-sized impurities by the mesh <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention.
