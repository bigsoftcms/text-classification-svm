<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention include switches that can be opened and closed to allow or block the flow of fluid through a channel in response to the pressure level in a gate of the switch. The microfabricated fluidic switches may be coupled together to perform logic functions and Boolean algebra, such as inverters, AND gates, NAND, gates, NOR gates, and OR gates. The logic gates may be coupled together to form flip-flops that latch signals. The present invention also includes microfabricated fluidic pressure multipliers that increase the pressure in a second chamber relative to a first chamber. Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention also include high or low pressure sources. A pressure source of the present includes a pump coupled to a reservoir through unidirectional valves. Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention may also include devices that perform analog functions such as switching regulator.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to microfabricated fluidic systems and methods for regulating the flow of fluid to provide switches, logic gates, latches, pressure sources, analog devices, capacitors, unidirectional valves, pressure multipliers, and devices that perform mathematical functions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microfabricated fluidic chips may be used for biological assays. For example, microfabricated fluidic chips may be used to perform biological assays using external control lines that control the opening and closing of on-chip fluidic valves. The on-chip fluidic valves control the flow of fluids in biological assays. The valves are opened and closed using macroscopic pressure sources that are located off-chip, and which are connected through control lines to the chip. In complex assays, a large number of macroscopic control lines is cumbersome and undesirable. Previously known electrical actuating devices have not been able to provide sufficient force by themselves to open or close a fluidic valve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would therefore be desirable to provide pressure sources and control lines on-chip that control the opening and closing of on-chip valves so that macroscopic control lines exiting the chip are minimized or eliminated. Previously known on-chip systems have not been adequate to provide control of numerous on-chip valves. Each valve requires a pressure differential between the input and the output to control the valve. Numerous valves coupled together to perform complex functions would require very large pressure differentials to drive all of the cascaded valves. Pressure sources that generate such very high pressure differentials are difficult to manufacture on a microfabricated chip.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, such cascaded valve systems do not allow for the introduction of feedback elements. A feedback element is one whereby a (downstream) output pressure, which is controlled by an upstream valve or is controlled by a valve which is controlled by the upstream valve (and so on), in turn controls the function of the upstream valve. The elimination of the possibility of feedback precludes the construction of entire classes of analog devices and digital logic devices (e.g., latches).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would also be desirable to provide numerous microfabricated fluidic switches on-chip that open and close channels without the need for large pressure differentials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would also be desirable to provide devices that perform logic functions, signal latching, mathematical functions, and other complex functions on-chip.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would also be desirable to provide microfabricated fluidic switches on-chip that incorporate the feed back of information from a downstream part of the circuit to an upstream part.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide pressure sources and control lines that control the opening and closing of valves on-chip so that macroscopic control lines exiting the chip are minimized or eliminated.</p>

The microfluidic switches, logic gates, and latches of the present invention may operate entirely on-chip without the need for off-chip pressure sources.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also provides on-chip pressure sources that can drive the microfluidic switches, logic gates and latches. The present invention also provides on-chip microfluidic unidirectional valves, capacitors, switching regulators, and pressure multipliers, that are formed with elastomer material that can also operate without off-chip pressure sources. The devices and methods of the present invention control and channel fluid movement on-chip to perform a variety of functions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention may be configured to imitate the functionality of semiconductor circuits, such as ON/OFF switches, capacitors, logic gates, latches, switching regulators, and devices that perform mathematical functions.

For example, devices of the present invention include switching regulators, capacitors, pressure multipliers, and pressure sources. Other analog functions may also be performed using microfluidic devices of the present invention.</p>

where M is the bulk modulus of the elastomer layer, H is the vertical height of chamber <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) when P<sub>1 </sub>is at ambient pressure, &#x394;H is change in the vertical height of chamber <b>38</b> when P<sub>1 </sub>is increased above ambient pressure and layer <b>35</b> presses down on chamber <b>38</b>, A<sub>32 </sub>is the horizontal surface area of a cross section of elastomer layer <b>32</b> that is underneath layer <b>35</b> (within the dotted line <b>35</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), and A<sub>38 </sub>is the horizontal surface area of chamber <b>38</b> that is under layer <b>35</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Chamber <b>37</b> reduces the force with which elastomer material in layer <b>32</b> presses up against rigid material <b>35</b> when material <b>35</b> is forced downward (with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), preserving the pressure amplification effect on P<sub>2</sub>. Pressure multiplier <b>30</b> is advantageous, because it can be microfabricated (e.g., less than 1 mm thick). Also, the fluid in input chamber <b>34</b> is isolated from the fluid in output chamber <b>38</b>. This may be an advantage, because the fluids in the input and output chamber of a pressure multiplier may be different types of fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a symbol for a pressure multiplier such as pressure multiplier <b>30</b>. In a further embodiment, P<sub>0 </sub>need not be ambient pressure, but may be any pressure level.

Microfluidic pressure multipliers of the present invention may be coupled with other microfluidic devices (that are discussed in further detail below) to build devices such that perform a variety of analog functions such as integration and differentiation using configurations known to those of skill in the semiconductor circuit art.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention also include devices that act as switches that may be turned ON and OFF. A fluidic switch is &#x201c;open&#x201d; during its ON state allowing fluid flow through the channel between the source and the drain. A fluidic switch is &#x201c;closed&#x201d; during its OFF state preventing fluid flow through the channel between the source and the drain. Microfluidic switches are opened and closed by changing the pressure in the gate of the switch. The pressure in the gate of the switch does not need to be increased above or reduced below the pressure in the drain-to-source channel. This provides an advantage, because microfluidic switches of the present invention can be coupled together to control each other on a single chip to perform complex logic, mathematical, multiplexing, and latching functions.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the pressure P<sub>1 </sub>in channel <b>74</b> is increased above P<sub>0</sub>, the radius of channel <b>74</b> expands and rigid layer <b>75</b> moves downwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> applying pressure against channel <b>78</b> and chambers <b>79</b>A-<b>79</b>B. As P<sub>1 </sub>increases, layer <b>75</b> presses down on the portion of channel <b>78</b> beneath layer <b>75</b> pinching channel <b>78</b> closed.

Chambers <b>79</b>A-<b>79</b>B provide less resistance to downward pressure on channel <b>78</b> than chambers <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, because chambers <b>79</b>A-<b>79</b>B are wider than chambers <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Chambers <b>79</b>A-<b>79</b>B allow channel <b>78</b> to be closed without having to increase the pressure in gate channel <b>74</b> above the pressure in channel <b>78</b>.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Microfabricated fluidic devices of the present invention may be connected together to form logic gates that perform logic functions and Boolean algebra. Previously known microfluidic chips often perform logic functions off-chip using electrical circuitry and then rout the output signal onto the microfluidic chip through macroscopic control lines which are cumbersome and take up a lot of space. Performing logic functions on chip using microfluidic logic gates can greatly reduce the number control lines routed onto the chip which advantageously saves space.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The bistable logic levels for the microfluidic logic gates are high pressure (HIGH) and low pressure (LOW). Each logic gate has a connection to a low pressure source (e.g., ambient pressure), and a connection to a high pressure source (e.g., at higher than ambient pressure). In an alternate embodiment, each logic gate has a connection to ambient pressure and a connection to a vacuum. In this embodiment, HIGH refers to the vacuum and LOW refers to ambient pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">All Boolean functions can be constructed entirely from NAND gates or entirely from NOR gates. A NAND gate performs an AND function on a set of inputs and inverts the output. A NOR gate performs an OR function on a set of inputs and inverts the output.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">An example of an inverter formed with microfabricated fluidic devices is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. Fluidic inverter <b>150</b> is a logic gate that accepts an input at IN and inverts it to provide an output OUT. OUT is the opposite logic state of IN. For example, if IN is HIGH, OUT is LOW, and if IN is LOW, OUT is HIGH. Inverter <b>150</b> comprises microfluidic resistor <b>151</b> coupled between ambient exhaust and OUT, and pressure actuated normally open microfluidic switch <b>152</b> which is coupled between OUT and a high pressure terminal. Input IN is coupled to the gate of switch <b>152</b>.</p>

Thus, having fluidic devices that perform the function of S-R flip-flips on the fluidic chip also greatly reduces the number of control lines that need to be brought onto the chip from external sources, providing additional space saving.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Further embodiments of the present invention include microfluidic vacuum actuated normally closed switches. Each of the valves discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15J</figref> may be used as vacuum actuated normally closed switches when its input channel is coupled to a pressure amplifier such as pressure amplifier <b>30</b> (FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B) as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Pressure applied to the gate of the resulting switch is amplified in the input channel of the valve. By adding a pressure amplifier to the input channel of one of the valves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15J</figref>, the pressure in the gate of the resulting switch does not need to be decreased below the pressure in the output channel between the source and the drain of the switch. Therefore, by adding pressure multipliers to the valves of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15J</figref>, the resulting switches may be coupled together to perform logic functions and Boolean algebra as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Valve <b>340</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> may be a microfluidic vacuum actuated normally closed switch when the gate is coupled to a pressure multiplier (as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Valve <b>340</b> has channels <b>341</b> and <b>342</b> formed in elastomer block <b>347</b> on rigid substrate <b>348</b>. Elastomer block <b>347</b> may comprise a plurality of elastomer layers sealed together. Channel <b>341</b> overlies and is perpendicular to channel <b>342</b>. Channel <b>341</b> is the control channel, and channel <b>342</b> couples the source and the drain of the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Cross sections of valve <b>340</b> along axis <b>345</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15B-15C</figref>. Elastomer block <b>347</b> includes elastomer region <b>349</b> which extends into channel <b>342</b>. The length of region <b>349</b> equals the width of channel <b>342</b>. When the pressure in channel <b>341</b> is at ambient pressure, region <b>349</b> extends into channel <b>342</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>. Region <b>349</b> completely blocks channel <b>342</b> preventing fluid from flowing there through, because region <b>349</b> fully fills the width of channel <b>342</b>. Therefore, valve <b>340</b> is closed in its normal state when pressure in channel <b>341</b> is at ambient.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">When the pressure in channel <b>341</b> is reduced (e.g., to a vacuum), region <b>349</b> retracts into channel <b>341</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, because of the pressure differential between channel <b>341</b> and channel <b>342</b>. Channel <b>342</b> opens when region <b>349</b> retracts into channel <b>341</b>. Fluid can now freely flow through channel <b>342</b>. Thus, vacuum pressure in gate <b>341</b> of valve <b>340</b> causes the switch to open, and ambient pressure in gate <b>341</b> causes the switch to close.</p>

<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As can be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15B and 15E</figref>, channel <b>341</b> is only slightly wider than region <b>349</b>, while channel <b>361</b> is much wider than region <b>365</b>. It is advantageous that channel <b>361</b> is much wider than channel region <b>365</b>, because it takes less of a pressure reduction in channel <b>361</b> to retract region <b>365</b> into channel <b>361</b>, than it does to retract region <b>349</b> into channel <b>341</b>. This is because elastomer regions <b>366</b>A-<b>366</b>B of block <b>363</b> are wide enough so that they do not have to stretch a lot to allow region <b>365</b> to retract into channel <b>361</b> relative to region <b>349</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0177">A disadvantage of valve <b>360</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15G-15H</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15G</figref> is a cross section of valve <b>360</b> along horizontal axis <b>367</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>) when the pressure in channel <b>361</b> is at ambient pressure and valve <b>360</b> is closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15H</figref> is a cross section of valve <b>360</b> along axis <b>367</b> when the pressure in channel <b>361</b> is a vacuum and valve <b>360</b> is open.

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">A further embodiment of the present invention includes structures and methods that provide high pressure sources for microfluidic applications. A high pressure source or a vacuum pressure source may be used as a power supply for microfluidic logic devices disclosed in this application. The pressure source is self-contained and self-recharging, making it ideal for devices that are implanted in the human body. The recharging mechanism works like a self-winding watch, in that motions in the device's environment are converted into potential energy.</p>

Fluid is pulled from the low pressure L.P. return through unidirectional valve <b>402</b> into pump <b>401</b>. Pump <b>401</b> then pumps fluid through unidirectional valve <b>403</b> into reservoir <b>404</b> which provides a high pressure source to a load at H.P. The working fluid in the system is recycled from the load, coupled to the high pressure H.P. outlet, back to the low pressure L.P. return.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">A microfluidic pressure source may be constructed using microfabricated fluidic devices, as will now be discussed. An example of a microfabricated fluidic pump <b>410</b> comprised of elastic material is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. Pump <b>410</b> has inner chamber <b>411</b>, inlet conduit <b>412</b>, and outlet conduit <b>413</b>.

<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Pump <b>410</b> may be bent or compressed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> to change the pressure within chamber <b>411</b> and to cause fluid to flow through conduits <b>412</b> and <b>413</b>. When pump <b>410</b> is bent or compressed, the pressure of fluid in chamber <b>411</b> increases above the pressure in a fluid reservoir coupled outlet conduit <b>413</b>, causing fluid to flow out of pump <b>410</b> through outlet conduit <b>413</b>. When pump <b>410</b> is no longer bent or compressed, it returns to its normal position, and the pressure in chamber <b>411</b> decreases below the pressure in a fluid reservoir coupled to inlet conduit <b>412</b>, causing fluid to flow into pump <b>410</b> through inlet conduit <b>412</b>. In this way, pump <b>410</b> pumps fluid into and out of chamber <b>411</b>.

When the pressure at input terminal IN is less than the pressure at output terminal OUT, the pressure at the output of multiplier <b>502</b> and the gate of switch <b>501</b> is LOW so that switch <b>501</b> is closed.

When the pressure at the HP terminal increases enough such that multiplier <b>622</b> increases the pressure at the gate of switch <b>621</b> above its threshold, switch <b>621</b> opens, causing fluid to flow from the HP terminal to ambient.</p>

<p id="p-0225" num="0224">A symbol for a pressure step source is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>. A pressure step source provides a rapidly increasing pressure signal at its output terminal OUT when a current signal is generated in the device. An example of a pressure step source is an electrolysis pressure source. The current signal is sent through sodium chloride solution in a channel within the electrolysis pressure source, that electrolyzes water in the solution to provide oxygen and hydrogen gas. The formation of gas bubbles in the sodium chloride solution causes the pressure in the channel to increase. The current I through the sodium chloride solution in the channel is shown in the top graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>. The increase in pressure P at output terminal OUT is shown in the bottom graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The increasing pressure signal output by a step pressure source can rapidly open a normally closed valve or switch (or rapidly close a normally open valve or switch). However, the pressure in the channel of a pressure source (such as an electrolysis pressure source) does not decrease rapidly enough to re-open or re-close the valve or switch. The valve/switch remains closed for a lengthy period of time until the electrolytic gases have leaked away through the porous elastomer.

When P<sub>4 </sub>goes LOW, switch <b>752</b> opens, coupling node n<b>2</b> to ambient exhaust. The pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at node n<b>2</b> now rapidly goes LOW. There may be a propagation delay between the time P<sub>2 </sub>goes HIGH and the time that P<sub>4 </sub>goes LOW.

<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Flip-flop <b>750</b> latches the output signals at nodes n<b>3</b> and n<b>4</b> until the next pressure pulse at step pressure source <b>753</b>. Flip-flop <b>750</b> can provide rapidly rising and falling HIGH and LOW signals at OUT and <o ostyle="single">OUT</o> at a high frequency, because it provides a system for bringing the pressure at the outputs of pressure sources <b>753</b>-<b>754</b> down rapidly. Flip-flip <b>750</b> uses two step pressure sources and six microfluidic normally-open pressure actuated switches to control one valve line coupled to outputs OUT and <o ostyle="single">OUT</o>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">A further embodiment of the present invention that provides a way to rapidly open and close a valve or a switch using a single step pressure source with appropriate delay logic is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>. Flip-flip <b>800</b> includes step pressure source <b>801</b>, microfluidic pressure actuated normally open switches <b>802</b> and <b>803</b>, microfluidic resistors <b>804</b> and <b>805</b>, microfluidic capacitors <b>806</b> and <b>807</b>, microfluidic pressure actuated normally open switches <b>808</b> and <b>809</b>, and microfluidic NOR gates <b>810</b> and <b>811</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">For purposes of the following illustrative discussion, it is assumed that pressure P<sub>4 </sub>at node n<b>4</b> (the output <o ostyle="single">OUT</o> of NOR gate <b>810</b>) is at a HIGH level, and pressure P<sub>5 </sub>at node n<b>5</b> (the output OUT of NOR gate <b>811</b>) is at a LOW level. Therefore, switch <b>808</b> is open, and switch <b>809</b> is closed. Pressure P<sub>3 </sub>at node n<b>3</b> is HIGH, because node n<b>3</b> is coupled to a high pressure source HP through resistor <b>805</b>. Pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at node n<b>2</b> is HIGH, because node n<b>2</b> is coupled to a high pressure source HP through resistor <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">When pressure source <b>801</b> causes pressure P<sub>1 </sub>at node n<b>1</b> to increase to a HIGH level, NOR gate <b>810</b> causes pressure P<sub>4 </sub>at node n<b>4</b> to go LOW, because switch <b>808</b> is open as shown in the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>. When P<sub>4 </sub>goes LOW, pressure P<sub>3 </sub>at node n<b>3</b> transitions LOW rapidly, because node n<b>3</b> is coupled to node n<b>4</b> through capacitor <b>807</b>. Therefore, the decreasing pressure pulse at n<b>4</b> is transferred to n<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>. When P<sub>3 </sub>goes LOW, switch <b>803</b> opens and node n<b>1</b> is vented to ambient pressure, causing pressure P<sub>1 </sub>to go LOW. Subsequently pressure P<sub>3 </sub>at node n<b>3</b> increases back to a HIGH level according to the RC time constant of resistor <b>805</b> and capacitor <b>807</b>. The RC time constant of resistor <b>805</b> and capacitor <b>807</b> is chosen to be long enough to fully vent pressure P<sub>1 </sub>to ambient pressure when P<sub>4 </sub>goes LOW.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Also, when P<sub>4 </sub>goes LOW, NOR gate <b>811</b> causes pressure P<sub>5 </sub>at node n<b>5</b> to go HIGH. Switch <b>808</b> now closes, but P<sub>4 </sub>remains LOW because P<sub>5 </sub>(which is HIGH) is an input to NOR gate <b>810</b>. Switch <b>809</b> opens, because P<sub>4 </sub>is LOW. After P<sub>1 </sub>goes LOW, P<sub>4 </sub>and P<sub>5 </sub>maintain their logic states.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">After P<sub>3 </sub>has returned to a HIGH state, pressure source <b>801</b> causes pressure P<sub>1 </sub>at node n<b>1</b> to increase to a HIGH level again. NOR gate <b>811</b> then causes pressure P<sub>5 </sub>at node n<b>5</b> to go LOW, because switch <b>809</b> is open as shown in the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>. When P<sub>5 </sub>goes LOW, pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at node n<b>2</b> transitions LOW rapidly, because node n<b>2</b> is coupled to node n<b>5</b> through capacitor <b>806</b>. Therefore, the decreasing pressure pulse at n<b>5</b> is transferred to n<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>. When P<sub>2 </sub>goes LOW, switch <b>802</b> opens and node n<b>1</b> is vented to ambient pressure, causing pressure P<sub>1 </sub>to go LOW. Subsequently pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at node n<b>2</b> increases back to a HIGH level according to the RC time constant of resistor <b>804</b> and capacitor <b>806</b>. The RC time constant of resistor <b>804</b> and capacitor <b>806</b> is chosen to be long enough to fully vent pressure P<sub>1 </sub>to ambient pressure when P<sub>5 </sub>goes LOW.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Also, when P<sub>5 </sub>goes LOW, NOR gate <b>810</b> causes pressure P<sub>4 </sub>at node n<b>4</b> to go HIGH. Switch <b>809</b> now closes, but P<sub>5 </sub>remains LOW because P<sub>4 </sub>(which is HIGH) is an input to NOR gate <b>811</b>. Switch <b>808</b> opens, because P<sub>5 </sub>is LOW. After P<sub>1 </sub>goes LOW, and P<sub>4 </sub>and P<sub>5 </sub>maintain their logic states. Switches <b>802</b> and <b>803</b> vent P<sub>1 </sub>to ambient following each transition. Switches <b>808</b> and <b>809</b> toggle the output of pressure source <b>801</b> to the SET and RESET inputs of flip-flop <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Pulsing pressure P<sub>1 </sub>toggles the output state of OUT and <o ostyle="single">OUT</o> between &#x201c;on&#x201d; and &#x201c;off,&#x201d; providing signals that can rapidly open and close valves and switches. Flip-flop <b>800</b> can provide rapidly rising and falling HIGH and LOW signals at OUT and <o ostyle="single">OUT</o> at a high frequency, because it provides a system for bringing the pressure at the output of pressure source <b>801</b> down rapidly. Flip-flop <b>800</b> uses a single step pressure source and eight pressure actuated normally-open switches to control one valve line coupled to outputs OUT and <o ostyle="single">OUT</o>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 37A</figref> may be used in the general case of asynchronous logic. For sections of the microfluidic logic which operate synchronously, the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> may be used. Flip-flop <b>850</b> includes step pressure source <b>851</b>, microfluidic pressure actuated normally open switches <b>852</b>-<b>854</b>, microfluidic NOR gates <b>855</b>-<b>856</b>, and a single clock signal line ( <o ostyle="single">RESET</o>) coupled to the gate of switch <b>852</b>. <o ostyle="single">RESET</o> is normally HIGH. All step sources including step pressure source <b>851</b> are vented simultaneously when <o ostyle="single">RESET</o> is LOW.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">When pressure P<sub>1 </sub>at node n<b>1</b> goes HIGH, NOR gate <b>855</b> causes pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at n<b>2</b> to go LOW (assuming for illustration that switch <b>854</b> is open and switch <b>853</b> is closed). Subsequently, NOR gate <b>856</b> causes pressure P<sub>3 </sub>at node n<b>3</b> to go HIGH. Switch <b>854</b> now closes, and switch <b>853</b> opens. The pressures at P<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>3 </sub>will hold their current states (LOW and HIGH, respectively), when P<sub>1 </sub>goes LOW. When <o ostyle="single">RESET</o> subsequently goes LOW for short period of time, switch <b>852</b> opens, and P<sub>1 </sub>is pulled LOW (to ambient pressure). <o ostyle="single">RESET</o> then returns to a HIGH state.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">When P<sub>1 </sub>subsequently goes HIGH again. NOR gate <b>856</b> causes pressure P<sub>3 </sub>at n<b>3</b> to go LOW (because switch <b>853</b> is open). Subsequently, NOR gate <b>855</b> causes pressure P<sub>2 </sub>at node n<b>2</b> to go HIGH. Switch <b>853</b> now closes, and switch <b>854</b> opens. The pressures at P<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>3 </sub>hold their previous states (HIGH and LOW, respectively), until P<sub>1 </sub>goes HIGH again. When P<sub>1 </sub>goes HIGH again, the cycle repeats, and pressures at P<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>3 </sub>change state again.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Another microfluidic switch of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-39D</figref>. Pressure actuated normally open switch <b>900</b> includes elastomer layers <b>901</b>, <b>902</b>, and <b>903</b> that are form on top of rigid substrate <b>904</b>. Layer <b>901</b> includes channel <b>910</b>, which is the gate of the switch. Layer <b>902</b> includes chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b>, which are shown by the dotted lines in the top down view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref>. Chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> are connected to ambient exhaust. Layer <b>903</b> includes channel <b>914</b>, which couples the drain and the source of the switch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref> is a cross section view along channel <b>910</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39C</figref> is a cross section view perpendicular to channel <b>910</b>, that does not intersect chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> or channel <b>914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The pressure in chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> may be at ambient pressure. When the pressure in gate channel <b>910</b> increases above ambient, the channel <b>910</b> presses down on the area between chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b>. The V shaped cross-section of this elastomer layer concentrates force from a large area under channel <b>910</b> onto a small area over channel <b>910</b>. When the pressure on channel <b>910</b> is increased enough, channel <b>914</b> closes, decoupling the source and the drain of switch <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The pressure in channel <b>910</b> may be increased and decreased above and below a threshold to open and close channel <b>914</b> as a switch. Chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> may be formed in layer <b>902</b> by placing photoresist on a silicon substrate, etching the photoresist, and then baking it to form photoresist regions <b>931</b> and <b>932</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39D</figref>. Elastomer is formed over regions <b>931</b>-<b>932</b>, and regions <b>931</b>-<b>932</b> act as a mold to form chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> in the elastomer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Layer <b>901</b> may be, for example, 10 microns to 2 mm. Specific examples include 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10,000, 11,000, 12,000, 13,000, 14,000, 15,000, 16,000, 17,000, 18,000, 19,000 and 20,000 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Layers <b>902</b> and <b>903</b> may be, for example, 1-1000 microns. Specific examples include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Channel <b>910</b> and chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> may be, for example, 2.5-5000 microns wide. Specific examples include 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 60, 75, 85, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, and 5000 microns. Channel <b>910</b> and chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> may be, for example, 1-200 microns high. Specific examples include 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Channel <b>914</b> may be, for example, 0.1-250 microns wide. Specific examples include 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 210, 220, 225, and 250 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Channel <b>910</b> and chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> act as an inverted pyramid pressure structure that takes the force of a smaller pressure buildup in a larger area in channel <b>910</b>, and concentrates that force into a larger pressure over a smaller area into channel <b>914</b> (where channel <b>914</b> intersects channel <b>910</b>). Chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b> focus the pressure increase in channel <b>910</b> over channel <b>914</b>. This design provides a way to amplify the effect of a pressure increase in channel <b>910</b> to open and close channel <b>914</b> without having to increase the pressure in channel <b>910</b> above the pressure in channel <b>914</b>. Layer <b>901</b> may be referred to as the control layer, layer <b>902</b> is the focus layer, and layer <b>903</b> is the flow layer.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Chambers <b>911</b> and <b>912</b> allow channel <b>914</b> to be closed without having to increase the pressure in gate channel <b>910</b> above the pressure in drain-to-source channel <b>914</b>. Therefore, switch <b>900</b> may be coupled with other microfluidic switches to perform logic functions and other functions, because switch <b>900</b> does not require a pressure drop from the gate channel to the source-to-drain channel.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The present invention also includes other inverted pyramid pressure amplification switches, such as the switches <b>950</b> and <b>970</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40-41</figref>. Pressure actuated normally open switch <b>950</b> includes elastomer layers <b>951</b>, <b>952</b>, and <b>953</b> which are formed on rigid substrate <b>954</b>. Layer <b>951</b> includes gate channel <b>957</b>, layer <b>952</b> includes chambers <b>955</b>-<b>956</b>, and layer <b>953</b> includes drain-to-source channel <b>958</b>. Channel <b>957</b> is perpendicular to channel <b>958</b>. When pressure in gate channel <b>957</b> increases, chambers <b>955</b>-<b>956</b> concentrate the force over channel <b>958</b> to close channel <b>958</b>. Chambers <b>955</b>-<b>956</b> are rectangular, and therefore they provide less effective force transmission to channel <b>958</b> than chambers <b>911</b>-<b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Pressure actuated normally open switch <b>970</b> includes elastomer layers <b>971</b>, <b>972</b> and <b>973</b>, which are formed on rigid substrate <b>974</b>.

Channel <b>977</b> is perpendicular to channel <b>978</b>. When pressure in gate channel <b>977</b> increases, chambers <b>975</b>-<b>976</b> concentrate the force over channel <b>978</b> to close channel <b>978</b>. Chambers <b>975</b>-<b>976</b> concentrate the force from channel <b>977</b> over channel <b>978</b> more effectively than chambers <b>955</b>-<b>956</b>, because chambers <b>975</b>-<b>976</b> are shaped as trapezoids.</p>
