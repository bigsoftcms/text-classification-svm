<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/859,273, filed on Nov. 15, 2006, entitled &#x201c;Removable Accessory Mounting Rail for a Firearm,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/814,139, filed on Jun. 16, 2006, entitled &#x201c;Adjustable Cheek Rest for Firearms,&#x201d; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to rail mounted accessories for firearms and, more particularly to an adjustable cheek rest that may be installed on a fixed or removable accessory rail on shoulder-mounted firearms such as carbines and rifles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adjustable cheek rests on the butt stock of rifles and carbines assist the shooter in getting quickly and comfortably into proper sight alignment. Standard butt stocks do not account for different sizes and shapes of shooter physique, or different type aiming sights and scope mounts. An adjustable cheek rest allows the shooter to customize drop and eye relief adjustments such that when the shooter lays his cheek on the cheek rest, his dominant eye is automatically aligned with the sight system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been a long known practice to provide an accessory mounting rail on a firearm for releasably attaching accessories, such as optics and lighting equipment. Common type accessory mounting rails include the Picatinny rails and the Weaver rails.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention provides a cheek rest assembly adapted for rail-mounted attachment on a firearm butt stock. The cheek rest assembly includes a comb having a generally U-shaped cross-section adapted to substantially conform to the underlying butt stock onto which the comb is mounted. The comb is adjustably mounted to enable adjustment of both the height (i.e., vertical distance when the firearm is leveled parallel to the ground) and longitudinal location of the comb (i.e., position parallel to the length of the firearm) with respect to the butt stock.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment, the cheek rest assembly includes a mounting fixture for attaching the comb to the butt stock. The mounting fixture includes a base which supports an arm, the arm having an elongate slot adapted for receiving an internally threaded stud extending from the comb. A mounting plate is received onto the stud, and a capped bolt engages the internal threads of the stud. When the capped bolt is tightened into the threaded stud, the arm is clamped between the washer and the comb, thereby adjustably securing the comb to the arm at a desired location on the arm. The location of the bolt may be adjusted along the elongate slot in arm to provide adjustment in the height of the comb with respect to the butt stock.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The base of the mounting fixture comprises a substantially C-shaped cross-section dimensioned for sliding receipt of an accessory rail carried by the butt stock. Sliding movement of the base of the mounting fixture along the accessory rail results in translation of the arm of the mount forward and backward, thereby longitudinally adjusting the comb with respect to the butt stock. Preferably, an engagement mechanism is carried or defined by the base of the mounting fixture for releasably securing the mounting fixture to the accessory rail in a desired location along the butt stock.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According one embodiment, the check rest assembly includes a removable accessory rail assembly for a firearm. The removable rail assembly includes a rail body and a mating backing member interconnected to each other for securing the mounting rail to the firearm. The rail body and the backing member are attached to each other through an elongate opening in the butt stock. The rail body and the backing member are preferably attached to each other using threaded fasteners. The rail body includes a mounting platform and a base, the based being adapted to distance the mounting platform from the butt stock to provide access to the mounting platform for releasably attaching an accessory to the mounting platform. The mounting platform preferably includes outwardly protruding lobes for engagement with a cooperatively formed portion of an accessory in the manner of a dove-tail connection for securing the accessory to the firearm.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to the figures, where like numerals identify like elements, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> a cheek rest assembly <b>10</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The cheek rest assembly <b>10</b> is shown mounted on a butt stock <b>12</b> that is adapted for attachment to a carbine. The cheek rest assembly <b>10</b> includes a comb <b>14</b>, one side of which defines a contact surface for a shooter's cheek. In the depicted embodiment of the cheek rest assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the cheek contact area is on the left-hand side comb <b>14</b>, for contact with the right cheek of a right-handed shooter. It is understood that the cheek rest assembly may just as readily be oriented with the contact surface on the right-hand side of the comb <b>14</b> for use by a left-handed shooter. The cheek rest assembly <b>10</b> provides adjustability of both the height of the comb <b>14</b> with respect to the butt stock <b>12</b> and the location of the comb <b>14</b> longitudinally along the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, the comb <b>14</b> comprises an elongate body <b>16</b> having a substantially U-shaped cross-section that generally conforms to an upper portion of the butt stock <b>12</b> when the comb <b>14</b> is in the fully-lowered position over to the butt stock <b>12</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the comb <b>14</b> is connected to a carrier <b>18</b> secured to the body <b>16</b>. The comb <b>14</b>, body <b>16</b> and carrier <b>18</b> are preferably formed from molded plastic. As shown, the carrier <b>18</b> is bolted to the body <b>16</b>, but the carrier <b>18</b> may also be fastened by other equivalent conventional fastening means to the body <b>16</b>, or the carrier <b>18</b> may be formed integrally onto the body <b>16</b> as a molded unit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the carrier <b>18</b> includes a pair of recessed nut mounts <b>102</b> each defining an interior for receiving a hexagonal nut <b>106</b>, and an aperture for receiving a bolt <b>108</b>. The bolts <b>108</b> extend through the body <b>16</b> and the carrier <b>18</b> and are engaged by the nuts <b>106</b>, securing the carrier <b>18</b> to the body <b>16</b>. The carrier <b>18</b> further includes an internally threaded stud <b>30</b> that extends outwardly therefrom. A pair of substantially vertical guide grooves <b>22</b> recessed into a front face of the carrier <b>18</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the stud <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cheek rest assembly is installed onto the butt stock using a mounting fixture <b>24</b> that has a base <b>26</b> and a substantially vertically extending arm <b>28</b>. The mounting fixture <b>24</b> is used to adjustably position the comb <b>14</b> at a desired height over the butt stock <b>12</b>, and by moving to a different slot along the rail, locate the comb at a desired longitudinal location along the butt stock <b>12</b>. The base <b>26</b> is coupled to the rail on the butt stock, and the arm <b>28</b> is coupled to the carrier <b>18</b>. A stud <b>30</b> extends outwardly from the carrier <b>18</b> of the comb <b>14</b> and is received through an elongate slot aperture <b>32</b> defined by branches of the arm <b>28</b> of the mounting fixture <b>24</b>. A pair of guide tabs <b>29</b> projects inwardly from the arm <b>28</b>, the guide tabs <b>29</b> being disposed on opposite sides of the aperture <b>32</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The guide tabs <b>29</b> are adapted to be received into the corresponding guide grooves <b>22</b> in the carrier <b>18</b>. The engagement between the guide tabs <b>29</b> of the arm <b>28</b> and the guide grooves <b>22</b> of the carrier <b>18</b> positions the comb <b>14</b> with respect to the mounting fixture <b>24</b> and guides the upward or downward movement of the comb <b>14</b> with respect to the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mounting plate <b>34</b> having a central mounting aperture <b>38</b> and two lobe extensions <b>40</b> is received onto the stud <b>30</b> over the arm <b>28</b>, the mounting aperture <b>38</b> aligning with and receiving the internally threaded stud <b>30</b>. The lobes <b>40</b> are adapted to overlay the nut mounts <b>102</b> of the carrier <b>18</b>, thereby concealing and protecting the fasteners <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> located within the nut mounts <b>102</b>, the lobes <b>40</b> having dimples <b>41</b> adapted to be seated over the nut mounts <b>102</b> to maintain the orientation of the mounting plate <b>34</b>. A capped bolt <b>36</b> is received through the mounting aperture <b>38</b> of the mounting plate <b>34</b>, engaging the internal threads of the stud <b>30</b>. Tightening the bolt <b>36</b> into the stud <b>30</b> causes the arm <b>28</b> to be clamped between the carrier <b>18</b> and the mounting plate <b>34</b>, thereby adjustably securing the comb <b>14</b> at a desired height with respect to the butt stock <b>12</b>. The lobe dimples <b>41</b> on the mounting plate <b>34</b> maintain the mounting plate <b>34</b> in alignment with the arm <b>28</b>. When the capped bolt <b>36</b> is loosened from the stud <b>30</b>, the mounting plate <b>34</b> and carrier <b>18</b> may be slidably adjusted along the arm <b>28</b> to move the comb <b>14</b> upward or downward with respect to the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An accessory mounting rail <b>42</b> is preferably mounted on the butt stock <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>. The accessory rail <b>42</b> has a roughly T-shaped cross-section and may be dimensioned to be a standard Picatinny or Weaver rail or other similar configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment of the check rest assembly <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the base <b>26</b> of the mounting fixture <b>24</b> has a generally C-shaped cross-section dimensioned to slide over the accessory rail <b>42</b> and be locked into position along the rail. Accordingly, when the assembly <b>10</b> is mounted to the butt stock <b>12</b> via the mounting fixture <b>24</b>, the position of the comb <b>14</b> may be adjusted longitudinally along the butt stock <b>12</b> by sliding the mounting fixture <b>24</b> along the accessory rail <b>42</b>. The mounting fixture <b>24</b> includes a typical engagement latch (not illustrated) for releasably securing the mounting fixture <b>24</b> to the accessory rail <b>42</b> in a desired location on the rail <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For butt stocks that do not have a built-in accessory rail, the present invention also includes a mechanism to allow an accessory rail assembly <b>44</b> to be removably mounted on the butt stock <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref> show an exemplary embodiment of the removable accessory rail assembly <b>44</b>. The accessory rail assembly <b>44</b> includes an accessory rail body <b>46</b> and a mating backing member <b>48</b>. As illustrated, the accessory rail body <b>46</b> is located on a right-hand side of the butt stock <b>12</b> and the mating backing member <b>48</b> is located on an opposite left-hand side of the butt stock <b>12</b>. The accessory rail assembly <b>44</b> is secured to the butt stock <b>12</b> by attaching the rail body <b>46</b> to the backing member <b>48</b> using an attachment means <b>50</b> that passes through an elongate aperture <b>52</b> in a recessed plate <b>54</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rail body <b>46</b> extends in a longitudinal direction and has a generally T-shaped cross-section comprising a base <b>56</b> and a mounting platform <b>58</b> both extending the length of the rail body <b>46</b>. The mounting platform <b>58</b> is wider than the base <b>56</b> and is attached to one side of the base <b>56</b>, the mounting platform <b>58</b> extending outwardly from the base <b>56</b> in opposite directions transverse to the longitudinal rail body <b>46</b>. An opposite side <b>60</b> of the base <b>56</b> contacts the recessed plate <b>54</b> and overlays the aperture <b>52</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b>. The base <b>56</b> functions to distance the mounting platform <b>58</b> of the rail body <b>46</b> from the recessed plate <b>54</b> in order to provide access to the mounting platform <b>58</b> for attaching an accessory to the rail body <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The mounting platform <b>58</b> includes a longitudinal slot <b>64</b> extending the full length of the mounting platform <b>58</b>, and further includes a plurality of laterally-extending cross slots <b>66</b>. The slotting of the mounting platform <b>58</b> in this manner provides stability to the mounting platform <b>58</b> by allowing for expansion and contraction without significant distortion of the mounting platform <b>58</b> as the firearm heats and cools. Because the rail body <b>46</b> is interconnected to the backing member <b>48</b> through the elongate aperture <b>52</b> in the recessed plate <b>54</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b>, the rail body <b>46</b> is permitted to expand and contract in the longitudinal direction in reaction to the heating or cooling of the firearm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>A, and <b>12</b>B, the mounting platform <b>58</b> comprises a plurality of lobes <b>68</b> protruding outwardly from the rail body <b>46</b>, the lobes <b>68</b> being defined by the longitudinal slot <b>64</b> and the cross slots <b>66</b>. The outwardly protruding lobes <b>68</b> are adapted to receive a cooperatively formed mounting portion of an accessory in the manner of a dove-tail connection for securing the accessory to the mounting platform <b>58</b> of the rail body <b>46</b>. Typically, the mounting portion of the accessory may be of at least two forms. In one form, the mounting portion of the accessory is generally C-shaped and is adapted to slidably engage the outwardly protruding lobs <b>68</b> of mounting platform <b>58</b> from either end of the rail body <b>46</b>. In another form, the mounting portion of the accessory comprises a mechanism for clamping onto the mounting platform <b>58</b> so as to envelope the lobes <b>68</b>, for example by having first and second portions of the accessory movably connected to each other to move between relatively opened and closed positions, or by having a rail grabbing means such as bolts, thumbscrews, or levers. The depicted rail body <b>46</b> is configured as a Picatinny rail. However, the present invention is not limited to any particular rail, and it is envisioned that the rail body <b>46</b> could be configured as a Weaver rail or other similar accessory rail form.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</figref> and <b>11</b>A through <b>13</b>B, the rail body <b>46</b> and the backing member <b>48</b> of the removable accessory rail assembly <b>44</b> are adapted for attachment to each other to secure the rail body <b>46</b> to the butt stock <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the butt stock <b>12</b> includes the elongate aperture <b>52</b> in the recessed plate <b>54</b> adjacent to a sleeve portion <b>70</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b>. The aperture <b>52</b> provides for passage of connectors between the rail body <b>46</b> and the backing member <b>48</b>. The rail body <b>46</b> and the backing member <b>48</b> are secured to each other and to the butt stock <b>12</b> using an attachment means <b>50</b>, a preferred attachment means <b>50</b> being described as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>12</b>A, and <b>12</b>B, the rail body <b>46</b> comprises an opening <b>72</b> for receiving a threaded bolt <b>80</b> and another opening <b>74</b> for receiving a threaded nut <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>13</b>A, and <b>13</b>B, the backing member <b>48</b> include an opening <b>76</b> for receiving a threaded bolt <b>80</b> and another opening <b>78</b> for receiving a threaded nut <b>82</b>. The interconnecting bolts <b>72</b> pass through the elongate aperture <b>54</b> in the recessed plate <b>54</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b> and engage mating nuts <b>74</b>, the bolts <b>72</b> and the nuts <b>74</b> being secured with the respective openings in the rail body <b>46</b> and the backing member <b>48</b>. It is understood that other attachment means <b>50</b> known in the mechanical arts could alternately be used to secure the rail body <b>46</b> and the backing member <b>48</b> to each other and to the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the base <b>56</b> of the rail body <b>46</b> is not solid but comprising recessed portions <b>86</b>, to decrease the contact surface area between the rail body <b>46</b> and the butt stock <b>12</b>. Limiting the contact area serves to limit the heat transfer between the firearm and the rail body, which decrease the thermal expansion and contraction of the rail body <b>46</b> as the firearm heats and cools. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the backing member <b>48</b> also includes a recessed portion <b>90</b> that limits the contact area between the backing member <b>48</b> and the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the base <b>56</b> of the rail body <b>46</b> may further include an elongate slotted aperture <b>84</b> disposed at an intermediate location between the mounting rail <b>58</b> and the butt stock <b>12</b> when the rail body <b>46</b> is mounted to the butt stock <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the slotted aperture <b>84</b> is adapted to receive a hook, clip, or other looped element, for example for hanging support of the firearm. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>13</b>A, and <b>13</b>B, the backing member <b>48</b> may further include an opening <b>94</b> for receiving a bolt and nut combination for mounting another accessory, and an elongate aperture <b>88</b> for receiving yet another accessory. The elongate aperture <b>88</b> is defined by a portion <b>92</b> of the backing member <b>48</b>, the portion <b>92</b> being thinner than the backing member <b>48</b>, the portion <b>92</b> further being spaced apart from the butt stock <b>12</b> when the backing member <b>48</b> is mounted to the butt stock <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the slotted aperture <b>88</b> is adapted to receive a hook, clip, or other looped element, for example for hanging support of the firearm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> through <b>8</b>, and <b>10</b> through <b>11</b>B, the butt stock <b>12</b> includes a spring-loaded pin <b>98</b> extending into an interior defined by a sleeve portion <b>70</b> of the butt stock <b>12</b>. The pin <b>98</b> is adapted for engaging receipt in an opening disposed in a tubular member of a carbine for securing the butt stock <b>12</b> to the carbine in the manner of a detent mechanism. The butt stock <b>12</b> includes a pivoting actuator <b>96</b> for retracting the pin <b>98</b> with respect to the interior of the sleeve portion <b>70</b> to release the carbine from the butt stock <b>12</b>.</p>
