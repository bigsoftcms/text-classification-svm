<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A hand guard system for use with a firearm is described. A holding unit for releasably coupling the hand guard system to a firearm includes a coupling element having an opening, a flange, and at least one coupling portion. The flange and the coupling portion form the opening so that the coupling element is slidably removable about the barrel of the firearm, and an inner surface of the coupling portion engages an outer surface of the barrel nut. The holding unit further includes a sleeve operatively coupled to the coupling element having an inner surface defining an opening so that the sleeve is slidably removable about the barrel of the firearm and the inner surface forms a shoulder and defines a groove distally located from the shoulder and sized to receive a snap ring. The snap ring retains the sleeve to the coupling element such that the shoulder and snap ring are located on opposite sides of the flange of the coupling element. The holding unit further includes a biasing member disposed between the flange and the shoulder of the sleeve to bias the sleeve away from the flange along a longitudinal axis of the barrel. The biasing member enables the sleeve to move between a first position and a second position relative to the coupling element.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to firearms, and, more particularly, to a hand guard system for use with a firearm.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Assault rifles typically include one or more (usually two) hand guard shells that at least partially surround a barrel to provide a comfortable grip and/or to provide protection from heat during firing. In such hand guard systems, supports or holding units at both a base end and a muzzle end of the barrel removably couple the hand guard shells to the firearm. The removable hand guard shells make it possible, for example, in the case of gas-operated firearms, to route or install a throttle control rod or a gas line that is coupled to a gas bleed port adjacent the muzzle end of the barrel into a housing or receiver adjacent the base end of the barrel. Such hand guard arrangements are typically employed, for example, in the M16 family of firearms.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern firearm systems increasingly demand additional component carriers (e.g., scopes, sights, etc.) to be mounted to the firearm above suitable coupling profiles such as, for example, a coupling profile of a Picatinny rail. In particular, for sighting or aiming components, it is often necessary to couple a component carrier to the barrel region of the firearm, if at all possible, without supporting the carrier on the barrel. In these instances, the holding units are typically removed and the component carriers are mounted to the firearm. In typical hand guard systems, however, the barrel must be removed in order to remove the holding unit, thereby limiting the flexibility of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, conventional hand guard systems often times limit the flexibility of a firearm because the use of a component carrier (e.g., a Picatinny rail, etc.) is only possible if the barrel is disassembled and the hand guard system, including the holding units, are replaced by the component carrier. This is particularly disadvantageous for firearms in which a sighting device is coupled to the barrel because removal of the barrel may require readjustment and/or recalibration of the sighting device. Additionally and/or alternatively, removal and reattachment of a barrel may be expensive and may require professional installation expertise.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain examples are shown in the above-identified figures and described in detail below. In describing these examples, like or identical reference numbers are used to identify common or similar elements. The figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features and certain views of the figures may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic for clarity. Further, throughout this description, position designations such as &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;behind,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;forward,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; etc. are referenced to a firearm held in a normal firing position (i.e., wherein the &#x201c;shooting direction&#x201d; is pointed away from the marksman in a generally horizontal direction) and from the point of view of the marksman. Furthermore, the normal firing position of the firearm is always assumed, i.e., the position in which the barrel runs along a horizontal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, the example hand guard system described herein is removably coupled to a firearm such as, for example, an M16 rifle, etc. In particular, the example hand guard system described herein comprises a first support or holding unit and a second support or holding unit, each of which removably couples to a firearm to support a hand guard shell therebetween without having to remove or disassemble a barrel of the firearm to remove the holding units. The first holding unit includes a biasing element, for example, a spring, that enables the first holding unit to be positioned between a first position, in which the first holding unit supports the shell around the barrel, and a second position, in which the first holding unit releases the shell from around the barrel when the shell is to be removed from the firearm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this manner, the example hand guard system can be replaced with a component carrier such as, for example, a Picatinny rail, without having to disassemble the firearm and, in particular, without having to remove or disassemble the barrel. This is particularly advantageous when a sighting device is coupled to the barrel, which may otherwise require readjustment and/or recalibration of the sighting device each time the barrel is removed and reattached to the firearm. The component carrier may be employed for the attachment of various accessories such as, for example, sights, scopes, etc. Additionally and/or alternatively, the example hand guard system described herein can eliminate or substantially reduce installation costs associated with disassembly and reattachment of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an example firearm <b>1</b> implemented with an example hand guard system described herein. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of the firearm <b>1</b> that extends from a gas bleed port <b>2</b> to a housing or receiver portion <b>3</b> of the firearm <b>1</b>. The gas bleed port <b>2</b> and the housing <b>3</b> are only partially shown. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a barrel nut <b>4</b> couples a barrel <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the housing <b>3</b> at a base end of the barrel <b>5</b>. The barrel <b>5</b> extends from the base end of the barrel <b>5</b> to a muzzle end and defines an axis <b>6</b>. Upper and lower hand guard shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are releasably coupled to the firearm <b>1</b> about the axis <b>6</b> of the barrel <b>5</b> via a first support or holding unit <b>8</b> and a second support or holding unit <b>9</b>. For example, the holding unit <b>8</b> includes a sleeve <b>13</b> and the holding unit <b>9</b> includes a groove <b>11</b>, each of which slidably receives a respective end <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; to support the upper and/or the lower hand guard shell elements <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular, the holding unit <b>8</b> is a generally cylindrical member that engages a mounting surface at the base end of the barrel <b>5</b>. The mounting surface may include at least one of an outer surface of the barrel <b>5</b>, the barrel nut <b>4</b>, the housing <b>3</b>, and/or any other suitable mounting surface on the firearm. In the illustrated example, the holding unit <b>8</b> is coupled to an outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>. The holding unit <b>8</b> includes a sleeve <b>13</b>, a coupling element <b>14</b>, and a biasing element <b>15</b>. The biasing element <b>15</b> is disposed between the sleeve <b>13</b> and the coupling element <b>14</b>. The sleeve <b>13</b> includes a groove to receive a snap ring <b>16</b> that retains the sleeve <b>13</b> to the coupling element <b>14</b>. In this example, the biasing element <b>15</b> includes a plurality of springs (e.g., compression springs) disposed generally uniformly around a periphery of the coupling element <b>14</b> and the sleeve <b>13</b>. Specifically, the springs are disposed between a flange <b>17</b> of the coupling element <b>14</b> and a support shoulder <b>18</b> formed at an inner surface of the sleeve <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A holding collar <b>19</b> is disposed between the shoulder <b>18</b> of the holding sleeve <b>13</b> and the coupling element <b>14</b>. The shoulder <b>18</b> of the sleeve <b>13</b> and the holding collar <b>19</b> engage the ends <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; to support the upper and lower shell elements <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In the illustrated example, the body of the upper and lower shell elements <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, when coupled together, form a frustoconical or tapered surface. When the holding collar <b>19</b> engages the ends <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2033;, the holding collar <b>19</b> provides a radial force to the upper and lower shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>in a direction that is away from the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b> and an axial force to the upper and lower shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>in a direction of the axis <b>6</b> toward the holding unit <b>9</b> to bias or move the ends <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; toward and/or within the groove <b>11</b> of the holding unit <b>9</b>. The upper shell <b>7</b><i>a </i>and lower shell <b>7</b><i>b </i>are thereby retained between the holding units <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. Additionally and/or alternatively, the frustoconical shape provides a wedge effect when the shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are coupled to the first and second holding units <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> to substantially reduce or eliminate firearm backlash or recoil imported to the shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>caused during firing of the firearm.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sleeve <b>13</b> includes a recess <b>28</b> sized so that the sleeve <b>13</b> can be slidably removed from the firearm <b>1</b> via the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the recess <b>28</b> enables the sleeve <b>13</b> to be slidably removed along an operating element such as, for example a gas tube <b>22</b>, and over the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or sighting device. In the example, the gas tube <b>22</b> extracts gas from barrel <b>5</b> after firing and redirects it back to an operating mechanism in the housing <b>3</b>. However, in other example implementations, the operating element may include a gas cylinder and/or any other mechanism(s) used to cycle the firearm (e.g., ejecting a fired cartridge and inserting a new cartridge). The snap ring <b>16</b> is a clasp-like structure also having a space or gap aligned with the recess <b>28</b> to allow the gas tube <b>22</b> to pass therethrough and to enable the snap ring <b>16</b> to be slidably removable from the firearm <b>1</b> via the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b> along the gas tube <b>22</b> and over the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or a sighting device. In this manner, the holding unit <b>8</b> removes from the firearm <b>1</b> without having to disassemble or remove the barrel <b>5</b> and/or the barrel nut <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the illustrated example, the outer surface of the sleeve <b>13</b> includes a plurality of stepped shoulders to form a gripping surface. In other example implementations, other surface configurations such as, for example, knurls, recessed grips, grip inserts, grip zones made of particularly easy to grip materials, etc., may be used to provide a grip to facilitate operation of the sleeve <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the example coupling element <b>14</b> is a clasp-like structure that includes sleeve or coupling portions <b>20</b>. The coupling portions <b>20</b> are partial cylindrical sleeve portions or segments adjacent (e.g., substantially perpendicular) to the flange <b>17</b>. The coupling portions <b>20</b> engage the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>, which also has a cylindrical outer surface. The coupling portions <b>20</b> form an opening having an inner diameter and an inner surface that is sized to be slidably received about the barrel <b>5</b>. The coupling portions <b>20</b> engage the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b> to couple or mount the coupling element <b>14</b> to the barrel nut <b>4</b>. Additionally, the coupling element <b>14</b> is slipped or slidably received about the barrel <b>5</b> and the barrel nut <b>4</b> and frictionally engages the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coupling element <b>14</b> includes a space or passage W to allow an operating element such as, for example, the gas tube <b>22</b> to pass therethrough and to enable the coupling element <b>14</b> to be coupled to and/or removed from the firearm <b>1</b> radially about the barrel <b>5</b>. Additionally, the space W enables the coupling element <b>14</b> to be coupled to and/or removed from the firearm <b>1</b> radially by slipping it around and/or pulling it away from the mounting surface of the barrel nut <b>4</b>. The coupling element <b>14</b> also included recess portions <b>23</b> to allow the coupling portions <b>20</b> to flex radially outward and to enable the coupling element <b>14</b> to be slipped over the barrel nut <b>4</b>, to frictionally engage the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>. In this example, the coupling element <b>14</b> has a slightly smaller diameter opening than that of the outer surface of the barrel nut <b>4</b> to provide a greater frictional engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the second holding unit <b>9</b> couples to a second mounting surface of the firearm at a distal end from the first holding unit <b>8</b>. In this example, the second holding unit <b>9</b> is a generally cylindrical clasp-like structure that couples or engages a mounting surface adjacent the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b> between the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and the lower shell element <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The mounting surface may be an outer surface of the barrel <b>5</b>, the gas bleed port <b>2</b>, sighting device, etc. In the illustrated example, the holding unit <b>9</b> includes a radial groove <b>24</b> on a first side that engages a protruding member <b>25</b> of the gas bleed port <b>2</b> to axially align (i.e., center) the holding unit <b>9</b> relative to the axis <b>6</b> of the barrel <b>5</b>. The holding unit <b>9</b> also includes a groove <b>26</b> adjacent to the groove <b>11</b> to receive a spring <b>27</b> that engages a corresponding groove <b>30</b> at the end <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; of the lower shell element <b>7</b><i>a</i>, thereby supporting and retaining the shell element <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The example second holding unit <b>9</b> includes a space or passage X to allow the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or a sighting device to pass therethrough when the second holding unit <b>9</b> is coupled to the firearm <b>1</b>. Additionally, the passage X enables the second holding unit <b>9</b> to be coupled to and removed from the barrel either radially (e.g., by slipping it around the barrels) or axially (e.g., by sliding it along the axis <b>6</b> of the barrel <b>5</b>) without having to disassemble or remove the barrel <b>5</b> and/or the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or a sighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As discussed above, the hand guard system enables the hand guards <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>to be removed and coupled to the firearm <b>1</b> without having to disassemble the barrel <b>5</b>. For example, to remove the shell elements <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>from the firearm, the sleeve <b>13</b> of the holding unit <b>8</b> is positioned to the second position by moving or sliding the sleeve <b>13</b> of the holding unit <b>8</b> against the force of the springs <b>15</b> in a direction along the axis <b>6</b> toward the housing <b>3</b>. When the shoulder <b>18</b> of the sleeve <b>13</b> is displaced beyond the holding collar <b>19</b>, the ends <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; of the shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are released and the upper and lower shells <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>pivot away from the barrel <b>5</b> to release the ends <b>7</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>7</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; from the groove <b>11</b> of the holding unit <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With the release of the hand guard shell <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the holding unit <b>9</b> may be removed from the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b>. In particular, the opening of the example holding unit <b>9</b> is sized so that the holding unit <b>9</b> can be slipped over the barrel <b>5</b>. In some examples, the barrel may have a frustoconical shape, which facilitates removal of the holding unit <b>9</b>. In other examples, the holding unit <b>9</b> may be removed radially by expanding or flexing the holding unit <b>9</b> outwardly so that the holding unit <b>9</b> can be slipped over the barrel <b>5</b>, the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or a sighting device at the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To remove the holding unit <b>8</b>, the holding unit <b>8</b> may be removed by sliding it from the barrel nut <b>4</b> and moving toward to the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b>. There, the holding unit <b>8</b> flexes or expands so that it slides over the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or any other obstacle. After the holding unit <b>8</b> is removed, a component carrier (not shown) or other hand guard (not shown) may be coupled to the firearm <b>1</b>, to the barrel <b>5</b>, and/or to the barrel nut <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some examples, the coupling element <b>14</b> of the holding unit <b>8</b> must be flexed or expanded when removed from the mounting surface such as, for example, the surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>. In this example, the snap ring <b>16</b> is removed from the holding sleeve <b>13</b> so that the holding sleeve <b>13</b> may be removed from the barrel nut <b>4</b> by sliding the sleeve <b>13</b> from the base end of the barrel <b>5</b> toward the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b> prior to removal of the coupling element <b>14</b>. The coupling element <b>14</b> is then expanded or flexed outwardly with, for example, a corresponding tool (not shown) to release the coupling portions <b>20</b> from the outer surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>. The coupling element <b>14</b> is then slidably removed via the muzzle end of the barrel <b>5</b>. In other examples, the width W of the coupling element <b>14</b> may be sized so as to enable it to be radially removed from the barrel nut <b>4</b> such as, for example, by slipping the coupling element <b>14</b> off the surface <b>12</b> of the barrel nut <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another example, the width W of the space of the coupling element <b>14</b> and the width of the snap ring <b>16</b> are sized to correspond to an outer diameter of the barrel <b>5</b> so that the coupling element <b>14</b> and the snap ring <b>16</b> slidably remove about the barrel <b>5</b> between the barrel nut <b>4</b> and the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and/or sighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In yet another example, the coupling element <b>14</b> is coupled to the barrel nut <b>4</b> via a non-frictional engagement and is aligned circumferentially about the barrel <b>5</b> when the shell elements <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are coupled to the holding units <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. In this example, the holding unit <b>9</b> is circumferentially aligned about the axis <b>6</b> when coupled or supported by the gas bleed port <b>2</b> and the holding unit <b>8</b> is circumferentially aligned about the axis <b>6</b> when coupled or supported by the housing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, although certain example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
