<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Several developments have taken place with regard to providing a control switch and/or an alarm circuit for detecting abnormal levels of water in air conditioning unit condensate collection pans and water leak containment pans for hot water heaters and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, there has been a continuing need for improvements in such devices including the provision of a device which may utilize a tablet which is readily dissolvable in water, and a control switch device which may be easily mounted in a condensate pan for an air conditioning cooling coil or a water containment pan for a hot water heater or the like. In particular, there has been a need for a control switch which can utilize a biocide composition tablet, such as of a type used in air conditioning condensate pans to minimize the accumulation of algae in the pan or an associated drain conduit, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has also been a need for a control switch device which will provide a signal to a thermostat or the like, and/or automatically disable a cooling mode of operation of an air conditioning system. Still further, there has been a need for a control switch which will provide an audible as well as a visual signal in the event of accumulation of abnormal amounts of water in a condensate collection pan or a water leak containment pan and which device may be periodically tested for operability and may be easily retrofitted to existing installations of air conditioning equipment, hot water heaters and similar equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is to the above-mentioned ends, as well as to provide other advantages in condensate pan and water leak containment pan control devices, that the present invention has been developed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides an improved control switch for providing a control or alarm signal as a result of abnormal levels of condensate collecting in an air conditioning system condensate collection pan or a water containment pan for apparatus such as hot water heaters and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a water leak control switch is provided which includes a corrosion resistant housing or support structure which is adapted to utilize and support a water soluble tablet, such as a biocide composition tablet used in air conditioning condensate pans to minimize algae growth or the like. The control switch is easily mountable within a condensate collection pan or a water leak containment pan wherein the electrical components of the switch are not immersed in liquid but a switch actuator is engageable with a water soluble tablet or the like which is conveniently mounted for replacement and is operable to be dissolved readily if an accumulation of condensate, for example, reaches a predetermined level. The water soluble tablet support structure is conveniently arranged for placement of the tablet therein and the housing or support structure is configured to minimize the tablet inadvertently falling out of its working position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a water leak control switch in combination with an alarm unit which is self-contained and may be mounted adjacent the control switch but in a position to be readily accessible to determine if an alarm signal is being provided and to test the operability of a control circuit. The alarm unit may be battery powered and include an on-off switch, audible as well as visual alarm devices, a test switch and compact construction to provide for economical production and ease of installation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Those skilled in the art will further appreciate the above-mentioned advantages and superior features of the invention together with other important aspects thereof upon reading the detailed description which follows in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the description which follows like elements are marked throughout the specification and drawing with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a portion of a condensate collection pan or water leak containment pan, generally designated by the numeral <b>10</b>, having a bottom wall <b>11</b> and a side wall <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a control or alarm switch in accordance with the invention and generally designated by the numeral <b>14</b>. The switch <b>14</b> is preferably characterized by a corrosion resistant non-buoyant support housing <b>16</b> including a base <b>18</b> having a generally planar first part <b>20</b> and suitably secured to sidewall <b>12</b> or just allowed to rest on bottom wall <b>11</b> in the position shown. Support housing <b>16</b> includes opposed flanges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> also which are joined by an arcuate part <b>26</b> having opposed legs <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> defining a receptacle characterized as a slot <b>32</b> which intersects arcuate part <b>26</b> as well as the legs <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>. Slot <b>32</b> preferably extends at an acute angle with respect to the plane of base part <b>20</b> and the bottom wall <b>11</b> of pan <b>10</b>, as shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Control switch <b>14</b> includes a switch unit <b>34</b> suitably mounted on part <b>20</b> of housing <b>16</b> and disposed well above an expected liquid level <b>35</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which might occur if a water using appliance developed a leak or if condensate collected from an air conditioning system, for example. Control switch unit <b>34</b> may be of a type commercially available such as sold under the trademark Microswitch. Control switch unit <b>34</b> includes a switch actuator part <b>36</b> and an elongated actuator lever <b>38</b> hingedly connected to the switch unit at <b>40</b> and engageable with the actuator part <b>36</b>. Lever <b>38</b> may be spring biased to move about hinge or pivot point <b>40</b> in a clockwise direction, viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to a switch open position or a closed position, depending on the circuitry of the switch unit <b>34</b>. The switch actuating lever <b>38</b> includes a distal depending part <b>42</b> which is engageable with a water soluble tablet element <b>44</b> comprising, preferably, a biocide composition which is readily water soluble and is of a type which is normally placed in air conditioning system condensate pans to minimize the accumulation of aquatic growths or the like. Slot <b>32</b> is dimensioned to receive tablet <b>44</b> and is angled in a direction wherein the base of the slot <b>32</b><i>a </i>is engageable with the tablet, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The tablet <b>44</b> is thus angled downwardly toward surface or base <b>32</b><i>a </i>and is unlikely to leave the slot <b>32</b> due to vibration or inadvertent movement of the pan <b>10</b>. Continuous spring pressure of the actuator arm <b>38</b> exerted on tablet <b>44</b> also aids in maintaining the tablet <b>44</b> in its working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. Switch unit <b>34</b> is adapted to be connected via suitable conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to a suitable control unit <b>54</b>. Control unit <b>54</b> may be associated with an air conditioning system, for example, an alarm circuit or other apparatus in which excessive of amounts of condensate or leaking water may accumulate within pan <b>10</b> and, upon actuation of switch <b>14</b>, will result in the shutdown of such apparatus as well as possibly sounding an alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the configuration of the control switch <b>14</b> is advantageous in that the parts of the switch which are likely to be in contact with condensate or other sources of water do not include electrical circuitry associated with the switch unit <b>34</b>. However, the configuration of housing <b>16</b> also assures that tablet <b>44</b> will be thoroughly wetted and immersed in liquid as it rises to level <b>35</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, the control switch <b>14</b> is adapted to be placed in condensate or liquid leakage containment pan <b>10</b>, as illustrated in the drawings, suitably connected to control unit <b>54</b> or an alarm circuit and then armed by placing a tablet <b>44</b> in the slot <b>32</b> and in engagement with the spring biased switch actuator arm <b>38</b>, <b>42</b>. As condensate or leaking water collects in pan <b>10</b> it rises to a level wherein it contacts the tablet <b>44</b>. Tablet <b>44</b> will dissolve rather rapidly allowing the actuator arm <b>42</b> to move in a clockwise direction, for example, viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and causing the switch unit <b>34</b> to open or close to thereby send a signal to control unit <b>54</b> which could result in shutdown of an air conditioning system or generation of an alarm signal to bring to the attention of the user of a system associated with pan <b>10</b> that an abnormal level of water is collecting in the pan. Once the cause of the leakage or condensate accumulation has been corrected a new tablet <b>44</b> may be placed in slot <b>32</b> with switch actuator lever <b>38</b> depressed and in engagement with the tablet in preparation for further operation of the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated a self-contained alarm system, generally designated by the numeral <b>60</b>, which may include a sealed enclosure <b>62</b> within which a circuit is provided including a source of power comprising a battery <b>64</b>, an on-off control switch <b>66</b>, a momentary pushbutton type test switch <b>68</b> and suitable alarm generating means, such as a buzzer or similar audio type alarm generator device <b>70</b>. Additionally, a visual indicator <b>72</b> comprising a light emitting diode, for example, may be placed in parallel with the audio alarm generator <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, control switch <b>14</b> is placed in circuit with the alarm generator so that when switch unit <b>34</b> closes audio and visual alarms are generated. Accordingly, the device or apparatus <b>60</b> may be installed with a control switch <b>14</b> in a location where at least one of an audio and visual signal may be detected if a malfunction occurs which results in liquid accumulation in a condensate collection or leakage containment pan, such as the pan <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated an alternate embodiment of a control switch in accordance with the invention associated with a unit of heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, generally designated by the numeral <b>80</b>. The unit of HVAC equipment <b>80</b> is characterized by a thermostat <b>82</b> having at least terminals identified by the letters L/F, R, G, W and Y in accordance with conventional thermostat terminal markings. Thermostat <b>82</b> includes a visual temperature display <b>83</b> and a visual indicator <b>84</b> for indicating a system fault condition. System <b>80</b> also includes a so-called indoor unit <b>86</b> including a circulating fan or blower <b>88</b> and a heater unit <b>90</b>. An outdoor unit, such as a vapor compression condenser unit <b>92</b> is illustrated as being associated with the system <b>80</b>. The indoor unit <b>86</b> would also include a cooling coil, not shown, operably connected to the outdoor unit for circulating a refrigerant fluid therebetween in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An alternate embodiment of a control switch in accordance with the invention is associated with the system <b>80</b> and is generally designated by the numeral <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Switch <b>14</b><i>a </i>includes a switch unit <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the three way type supported in the housing <b>16</b> in place of the switch unit <b>34</b> and responsive to dissolving of the tablet <b>44</b> to move from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to an alternate position. For example, low voltage control power is supplied for the system <b>80</b> from a transformer <b>91</b> connected to terminal R of thermostat <b>82</b> and providing electrical power to terminal Y when the air conditioning system <b>80</b> is operating in a cooling mode and there is a call for cooling effect. In this mode, electrical power is supplied from terminal Y via a conductor <b>94</b> to switch unit <b>34</b><i>a </i>and, in the position shown, power is supplied to an indicator light <b>95</b> and to a relay <b>96</b> of the outdoor unit <b>92</b> causing a conventional vapor compression compressor and condenser to begin furnishing working fluid to the indoor unit <b>86</b> to effect cooling operation. Moreover, if condensate collects in a condensate pan <b>10</b><i>a</i>, similar to the condensate pan <b>10</b>, to a level which will dissolve the tablet <b>44</b> switch unit <b>34</b><i>a </i>will move to a position wherein power from thermostat terminal Y via conductor <b>94</b> will be conducted to a conductor <b>99</b> which is connected to the terminal L/F of thermostat <b>82</b> and will result in illumination of the indicator light <b>84</b>. Simultaneously, control power is shut off between conductor <b>94</b> and conductor <b>97</b> leading to the relay <b>96</b> so that the outdoor unit will cease operation resulting in loss of cooling effect delivered by system <b>80</b>, but also preventing additional collection of condensate in the condensate pan <b>10</b><i>a</i>. In this way, a user of the system <b>80</b> will be alerted to a fault condition and may take corrective action to eliminate the adverse effects of unwanted accumulation of condensate in the pan <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The construction and operation of the switches <b>14</b>, <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the alarm generator apparatus <b>60</b> and the system <b>80</b> are believed to be within the purview of one skilled in the art based on the foregoing description. Commercially available components may be utilized to construct the switches <b>14</b> and <b>14</b><i>a </i>except for the housing <b>16</b>, and commercially available components may be used to, essentially, construct the apparatus <b>60</b> and system <b>80</b>. The housing <b>16</b> is preferably formed of a suitable plastic having a density greater than water and may take other specific configurations while retaining the advantages described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although preferred embodiments of the invention, including a switch and alarm apparatus have been described in detail herein, those skilled in the art will also recognize that various substitutions and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.</p>
