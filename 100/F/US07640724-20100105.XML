<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to power generating plants and more particularly to a method and apparatus for deaerating make-up water thereby improving the efficiency of a steam turbine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Power generating plants, such as one operating a combined cycle power plant are well known for generating electricity. Combined cycle power plants use both gas and steam turbines. In such a plant, the power produced by a combustion turbine may be augmented by injecting steam or water into the gas flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the amount of power produced in the combustion turbine through such power augmentation is greater than the amount lost in the steam cycle due to the removal of steam. Power augmentation uses an appreciable quantity of steam generated from the heat recovery steam generator. When steam is removed for power augmentation, it is necessary to supply an equivalent amount of water as &#x2018;make-up&#x2019; to the steam cycle. The make-up water is typically fully oxygenated in equilibrium with the oxygen in air. The concentration of oxygen in the make-up water is higher than that required in the feedwater to the heat recovery steam generator. Thus, there is a need to remove oxygen from the make-up water.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Removal of oxygen from make-up water for deaerating is typically accomplished by spraying the make-up water into a deaerator in the condenser then transferring the deaerated make-up water to a hotwell. In the deaerator, steam may be used to strip the oxygen from the water. At low make-up water flow volumes, low-pressure exhaust steam may be used for stripping in the deaerator. However, at higher make-up water flow volumes, low-pressure steam from the heat recovery steam generator may be required for the deaerator to function properly. Using low-pressure steam to deaerate higher flow volumes of make-up water may significantly reduce the steam turbine power output thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the power plant.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic of certain components of an exemplary power plant <b>10</b>, such as a combined cycle power plant recognized by those skilled in the art. Power plant <b>10</b> may include a gas turbine engine <b>12</b> comprising a compressor <b>14</b>, a combustor <b>16</b> and a gas turbine <b>18</b>. A combined cycle power plant <b>10</b> may also include a steam turbine system <b>20</b> that may include a high-pressure turbine <b>22</b>, one or more low-pressure turbines <b>24</b> and an intermediate-pressure turbine <b>26</b>. The gas turbine engine <b>12</b> and steam turbine system <b>20</b> may drive a generator <b>28</b> for producing electricity, or other loads. The gas turbine engine <b>12</b>, steam turbine system <b>20</b> and generator <b>28</b> may be arranged in tandem on a single shaft <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternate configurations of power plant <b>10</b> may be multi-shaft arrangements wherein the gas turbine engine <b>12</b> and steam turbine system <b>20</b> drive separate loads, as well as others recognized in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Steam turbine system <b>20</b> may be associated with a multi-pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) <b>40</b> for recovering waste heat from gas turbine engine <b>12</b>. HRSG <b>40</b> may include low pressure, intermediate pressure and high pressure sections for providing steam to turbines <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, through connections <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, respectively. Exhaust steam from the HP turbine <b>22</b> may be returned to HRSG <b>40</b> for reheating through a connection <b>23</b><i>a</i>. HRSG <b>40</b> may also supply steam to gas turbine engine <b>12</b> for power augmentation, such as when gas turbine engine <b>12</b> is operating at or near base load. Under such operating conditions, up to approximately 20% of the steam generated in HRSG <b>40</b> may be used for power augmentation of turbine engine <b>12</b> resulting in a reduction in power output from steam turbine system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Spent or exhaust steam from low pressure turbine <b>24</b> may be received by a condenser <b>44</b>, which converts the steam into condensate that may be collected in a hotwell <b>42</b>. This condensate may be supplied back to HRSG <b>40</b> via fluid connection <b>46</b> as feedwater that is used to generate steam in HRSG <b>40</b>. Typically, the feedwater supplied back to HRSG <b>40</b> needs to be deaerated or degasified. Gases, typically oxygen, may be removed from the make-up water using a deaerator (not shown) that may be associated with the condenser <b>44</b> and hotwell <b>42</b>, so the feedwater remains low in oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When power plant <b>10</b> is operating, it is necessary to provide feedwater to HRSG <b>40</b> to replace the steam generated. Feedwater may be supplied to HRSG <b>40</b> from hotwell <b>42</b> through fluid connection <b>46</b> using a conventional pump. As demand requires, additional make-up water may be supplied to hotwell <b>42</b> from a make-up water source, such as supply tank <b>47</b> through fluid connection <b>48</b> using a conventional pump. During start-up of power plant <b>10</b> or when it's operating at part load, a relatively low flow volume of make-up water may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">At low flow volumes of make-up water, such as 2 gal/min, for example, a reverse flow of exhaust steam from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> through a deaerator may be used to degasify the water. At higher flow volumes of make-up water, such as 50 gal/min, for example, a reverse flow of steam from HRSG <b>40</b> may need to be injected through a deaerator to effectively degasify the water. Such a higher flow volume of make-up water may be required during power augmentation of gas turbine engine <b>12</b>. Drawing steam off HRSG <b>40</b> for deaerating make-up water reduces the quantity of steam available to the steam turbines and consequently the power output of steam turbine system <b>20</b>, which may present a cost disadvantage to an operator of power plant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When steam is removed from HRSG <b>40</b> for power augmentation of gas turbine engine <b>12</b>, an equivalent amount of water may be supplied as make-up water to the steam cycle. This make-up water is typically fully oxygenated in equilibrium with the oxygen in air. The concentration of oxygen in the make-up water is approximately 8500 &#x3bc;g/kg (ppb) or 8.5 mg/kg (ppm). The concentration of oxygen required in the feedwater to HRSG <b>40</b> may vary from approximately 2 ppb to approximately 300 ppb, depending on the chemistry regime implemented with a power plant <b>10</b>. In substantially all situations, it is desirable to remove between approximately 80% and approximately 99+% of the oxygen in the make-up water supplied as feedwater to HRSG <b>40</b> in accordance with plant specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventors of the present invention have determined that using steam from HRSG <b>40</b> to degasify water in a deaerator of a combined cycle power plant <b>10</b> may reduce the power output of steam turbine system <b>20</b> by up to approximately 0.6 MW. Embodiments of the invention allow for reducing or eliminating the need to draw steam from HSRG <b>40</b> to degasify feedwater during operation of power plant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this respect, means may be provided for injecting atomized water, which may be make-up water, under pressure into the exhaust steam of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. A means for injecting atomized make-up water may assume various configurations such as an exemplary assembly or atomizer <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Atomizer <b>60</b> may inject atomized make-up water into the exhaust steam downstream of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> and upstream of condenser <b>44</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An exemplary embodiment of atomizer <b>60</b> may include a plurality of commercially available nozzles <b>62</b> for producing fogs of atomized water, such as ones available from Parker Hannifin.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an exemplary embodiment, nozzles <b>62</b> may produce droplets with Sauter Mean Diameters of approximately 12 microns. It has been determined that a 12 micron droplet will be fully deaerated in approximately 2.4 milliseconds. This time is an estimate of an expected average lifetime for a droplet in a turbulent steam flow such as that exiting low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. Alternate exemplary embodiments allow for the droplet size to vary as a function of the amount of oxygen to be deaerated from the make-up water and the distance from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> to condenser <b>44</b>, as well as other operating parameters of power plant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The make-up water drawn from tank <b>47</b> may be approximately 30&#xb0; C. and pumped under pressure to atomizer <b>60</b> through fluid connection <b>64</b>. The make-up water flow volume, pressurization and nozzle <b>62</b> specifications may be selected to achieve the desired droplet size. It will be appreciated that the flow of make-up water from tank <b>47</b> may be regulated between atomizer <b>60</b> and hotwell <b>42</b> to optimize the performance objectives of steam turbine system <b>20</b>, HRSG <b>40</b> and/or turbine engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The performance of a steam turbine, such as low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> may generally be improved by lowering the backpressure to which the last row of blades of the turbine is subjected. Low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> may discharge to condenser <b>44</b>, in which a sub-atmospheric pressure may be maintained. Typically, the exhaust steam exiting low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> is discharged axially from the last row of blades and is directed to condenser <b>44</b>, which may mounted below or to the sides of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. The axially discharged exhaust steam may be turned approximately 90&#xb0; from the axial direction to a vertically downward direction. Flow guides defining an annular channel outside each exhaust end of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> may accomplish turning of the exhaust flow and directing the flow into condenser <b>44</b>. Surfaces of an outer shell and an inner casing within which low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> is contained may form such flow guides as appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The efficiency of a steam turbine is typically measured by its &#x201c;heat rate&#x201d;, which is the amount of heat that needs to be supplied to the feedwater in order to produce a specified generator power output. The heat rate is the heat input in BTUs per hour for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced (btu/kwh). The lower the heat rate, the less the thermal energy required and the better the efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of atomizer <b>60</b> may be positioned downstream of the last row of blades of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> and upstream of a first heat exchanging surface of condenser <b>44</b>, such as a first row of condenser tubes carrying cooling water. For example, atomizer <b>60</b> may be affixed proximate the inlet or neck of condenser <b>44</b> so that water droplets are directed into and substantially parallel to the flow of exhaust steam discharged from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. This causes a significant reduction in the pressure on the last row of turbine blades, which is caused by the velocity of the steam. Spraying parallel to the steam flow minimizes disturbance of the steam's velocity profile, which would occur by spraying counter current to the steam. Alternate embodiments allow for at least a portion of atomized water to be injected into the exhaust steam downstream of the first heat-exchanging surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that an embodiment of atomizer <b>60</b> may include a plurality of fluid connections <b>70</b> extending from a ring <b>72</b>, which may encircle the turbine shaft (not shown) of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. Connections <b>70</b> may be conventional pipes arranged in an array, concentric circles and/or a grid, such as symmetrically arranged fluid connections or &#x2018;spokes&#x2019; <b>70</b>. A plurality of nozzles <b>62</b> may be affixed to one or more spokes <b>70</b>. Spokes <b>70</b> may be affixed within or proximate to the flow guide at one or both exhaust ends of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. The plurality of nozzles <b>62</b> may be positioned so that in the event one or more nozzles <b>62</b> fails, a high velocity stream of water will not impinge condenser tubes within condenser <b>44</b>. This will avoid cutting or damaging a condenser tube, which may cause a condenser leak.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be appreciated that the configuration of atomizer <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as well as other configurations may be manufactured as a stand-alone or unitary device that is installed within a steam turbine assembly. Atomizer <b>60</b> may also be installed as individual components that form a desired configuration. For example, a plurality of individual fluid connections <b>70</b> may be affixed to an inner casing and/or outer shell of a steam turbine assembly and assume whatever configuration is desired for injecting atomized water into the exhaust steam downstream of the steam turbine exhaust and upstream of a condenser. In this respect, the precise location, size and configuration of one or more atomizers <b>60</b> and/or nozzles <b>62</b> may depend on the size of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>, flow rate of exhaust steam, amount of desired deaeration as well as other operating parameters of power plant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Injecting atomized make-up water directly into exhaust steam of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> results in some of the exhaust steam condensing onto the water droplets. This lowers the vapor pressure of the water in the exhaust steam, which reduces the backpressure on low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> and condenser <b>44</b>. Unless the last stage of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> is choked, the reduced backpressure will improve turbine efficiency resulting in an increase of power output for the same quantity of steam inlet into low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> from HRSG <b>40</b>. Because the water is atomized, the diffusion of oxygen out of the water is enhanced, which provides good deaeration at the same time as it improves the heat rate of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inventors of the present invention have determined that a decrease in heat rate for an exemplary steam turbine system <b>20</b>, such as one in a SCC6-5000F 2&#xd7;1 combined cycle power plant <b>10</b> sold by the assignee of the present invention, is realized as a consequence of the reduced backpressure on low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. The decrease in heat rate may be between about 10 btu/kwh and about 18 btu/kwh. At a constant fuel rate, this decrease in heat rate translates to between about 1 MW and about 1.8 MW of additional power output from power plant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Exhaust steam exiting low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> is typically moving near sonic velocity, which results in a lower effective pressure on the blades within turbine <b>24</b> relative to pressure on the blades if the exhaust steam were static. Embodiments of atomizer <b>60</b> may be configured or positioned so that the injection of make-up water into the exhaust steam does not disrupt what is a relatively even distribution of pressure on the blades within low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> during operation. This may be appreciated from the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which illustrates symmetrically arranged spokes <b>70</b> extending radially from a ring <b>72</b>. Alternate embodiments may include asymmetrical atomizers <b>60</b> as well as other arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this respect, a relatively even or symmetrical distribution of nozzles <b>62</b>, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may be desirable to avoid creating pressure imbalances proximate the respective ends of low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> from which exhaust steam is being discharged. The number, size and location of spokes <b>70</b> and nozzles <b>62</b> may depend on the quantity of make-up water that is being injected into the exhaust steam, the size and configuration of the path taken by exhaust steam from turbine <b>24</b> to condenser <b>44</b> as well as other factors recognized by those skilled in the art. For instance, it may be desirable to configure and position atomizer <b>60</b> to optimize the backpressure on low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>, the amount of oxygen removed from the injected make-up water and the quantity of feedwater supplied to HRSG <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Certain power plants <b>10</b> may be configured with steam turbine systems <b>20</b> having multiple low-pressure turbines <b>24</b> and consequently multiple exhaust ends. Embodiments of the invention allow for positioning a plurality of atomizers <b>60</b> within respective low-pressure turbines <b>24</b> so that the make-up flow of water is distributed approximately equally among multiple low-pressure turbines <b>24</b>. Alternate embodiments allow for the make-up water to be distributed disproportionately among multiple low-pressure turbines <b>24</b> depending on performance objectives of steam turbine system <b>20</b>, HRSG <b>40</b> and/or turbine engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention may be adapted for use with various types of power plants <b>10</b>, including ones having an air-cooled condenser into which exhaust steam is discharged. Exhaust steam would be transferred from the turbine to the air-cooled condenser through a steam duct. In this respect, an air-cooled condenser would typically be located a distance away from a steam turbine such as low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. Consequently, the travel time of the exhaust steam from the turbine to the air-cooled condenser is greater than a configuration where the condenser is situated immediately beneath the turbine. This allows for a commensurate increase in time for injecting atomized water into the exhaust steam. It also allows for the injected water droplets to be relatively large in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An alternate embodiment is to provide a supply tank (not shown) of cool water (30&#xb0; C., for example) that may be dedicated for cooling exhaust steam from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. When no make-up water is needed from supply tank <b>47</b>, cool water from a dedicated cool water supply tank could be used for cooling the exhaust steam from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b>. Since no water is removed from the cycle by power augmentation in this manner, the water level in hotwell <b>42</b> would rise. Water may be withdrawn from hotwell <b>42</b> to maintain a proper operating level and returned to the top of the dedicated cool water supply tank in a manner to minimize mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When ambient air is cool, such as at night, water may be withdrawn from the top of the dedicated cool water supply tank, cooled and returned to the bottom of this tank. In this respect, management of water flow from and into a dedicated cool water supply tank is similar to the water tank management for thermal energy storage, such as that used for chilling input air to a combustion turbine. Cooling exhaust steam from low-pressure turbine <b>24</b> using a dedicated cool water supply could be effective to increase megawatts from a conventional steam power plant.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another exemplary embodiment of a system with which exemplary embodiments of the invention may be used is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,804,964, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. In general, this patent discloses a method and apparatus for recovering water from exhaust gas of a combustion turbine engine. The recovered water may be used for various purposes including as make-up water injected into the exhaust steam of a low-pressure steam turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention may be adapted for use with steam turbines having various configurations of size, capacity and flow guide arrangements, for example, as well as other design and operating specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes and substitutions will occur to those of skill in the art without departing from the invention herein. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
