<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to providing a protective electrically conductive layer that covers a reactive layer (such as a reactive nanofoil) to protect the reactive layer from electrical discharge.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various operations are performed in a wellbore to enable the production of fluids from, or injection of fluids into, a reservoir in a formation surrounding a section of the wellbore. Examples of operations performed in a wellbore include perforating operations (to extend perforations through any surrounding casing or liner and into a formation), fracturing operations (to create fractures in a formation), and other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain operations involve the use of explosives. For example, perforating guns include shaped charges and detonating cords, and firing heads for perforating guns include primary and/or secondary explosives. Explosives can also be used in other types of downhole tools, such as propellants (which are considered low explosives) used in fracturing tools for performing fracturing jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When components containing explosives are being handled by humans, they present a safety hazard if adequate precautions are not taken. Typically, for well applications, components containing explosives are transported from a storage facility or manufacturing facility (or other type of facility) to the well site. At the well site, the components are assembled by well operators into a tool for deployment into a wellbore. During handling by humans, electrostatic discharge (ESD) may occur, which can cause inadvertent initiation of the explosive being handled. Such inadvertent initiation of explosives can cause serious injury or even death. Typically, components such as detonators that contain explosives include circuitry for ESD protection. However, conventional ESD protection, such as those implemented with spark gaps, are not always effective due to the possibility of manufacturing defect.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, an apparatus comprises an activation assembly for explosives, where such activation assembly includes elements that are desensitized so as to be resistant to electrostatic discharge.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a tool <b>100</b> that is deployed in a wellbore <b>102</b>, such as a wellbore for producing hydrocarbons from a reservoir surrounding the wellbore <b>102</b>. In an alternative implementation, the wellbore <b>102</b> can be used for injecting fluids into a reservoir. In other implementations, the wellbore <b>102</b> can be used for other purposes, such as to produce other types of fluids (e.g., water). Additionally, although described in the context of a wellbore environment, it is noted that some embodiments can be used in other applications, such as mining applications, geological survey applications, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tool <b>100</b>, which includes an explosive <b>106</b>, is deployed on a carrier line <b>104</b>, such as a wireline, tubing, slickline, and so forth. Examples of the tool include perforating tools, detonators, pipe cutters, valve actuators, packer actuators, fracturing tools, and so forth. The explosive <b>106</b> is coupled to an activation assembly <b>108</b> according to some embodiments, which is used to activate the explosive <b>106</b>. The activation assembly <b>108</b> is connected over a link <b>110</b> to a control unit <b>112</b>, which control unit can be an electrical control unit for supplying an electrical activation signal over the link <b>110</b> to the activation assembly <b>108</b>. For example, the control unit <b>112</b> can supply a pulse of electrical energy to the activation assembly <b>108</b> for activating the activation assembly <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the control unit <b>112</b> and activation assembly <b>108</b> can be integrated together rather than provided as separate units.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, the explosive <b>106</b> can be a low explosive, such as propellant, that has a relative low reaction rate. Propellants can be used in tools for performing fracturing operations. Initiation of a propellant causes generation of high-pressure gas in the wellbore, which high-pressure gas can be used to create fractures in the surrounding formation during a fracturing operation. In other implementations, the explosive <b>106</b> can be a high explosive, such as a primary explosive or secondary explosive, which has a relatively high reaction rate. Primary and secondary explosives are generally used in detonators for detonating other explosives, such as a detonating cord or shaped charges of a perforating gun. In other example implementations, explosives can have other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One safety concern associated with handling of components containing explosives is inadvertent activation due to electrostatic discharge (ESD) from a person's hand or from a tool held by the person. If the component is not properly protected against ESD, then the ESD can cause inadvertent activation of the activation assembly to cause initiation of the explosive, which can result in serious injury, death, and/or damage to property.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with some embodiments the activation assembly <b>108</b> includes a protection mechanism to prevent or reduce the likelihood that ESD (or other forms of electrical discharge) will cause inadvertent activation of the activation assembly <b>108</b>. The activation assembly <b>108</b> according to an example embodiment includes a reactive nanofoil, which contains a pyrotechnic mixture that exhibits redox reaction in response to an input to energy (such as an electrical signal pulse supplied by the control unit <b>112</b>). The reactive nanofoil includes a reactive intermetallic material, which contains a fuel that reacts with an oxidizer to release energy.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reactive nanofoil is shown as a layer <b>200</b> formed on a support structure <b>202</b>. In one embodiment, the nanofoil layer <b>200</b> is produced by sputtering aluminum and nickel onto the support structure <b>202</b>, which can be a plastic sheet (e.g., polyethyleneterphalate or PET). The composition containing the aluminum and nickel is one example of an intermetallic compound. In other embodiments, the nanofoil layer <b>200</b> can be formed using other intermetallic compounds, such as compositions made of aluminum and palladium, titanium and boron, or other compositions. More generally, the layer <b>200</b> is referred to as a reactive layer, which can be formed of a pyrotechnic material. An intermetallic material is a type of pyrotechnic material. Other examples of pyrotechnic materials include the following elements or combination of elements: (1) titanium; (2) potassium-perchlorate; (3) zirconium, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, instead of using plastic, the support structure <b>202</b> can also be formed using other insulating materials. Alternatively, the support structure <b>202</b> can also be formed of a metal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To provide ESD protection, an electrically conductive protective layer <b>204</b> covers the reactive layer <b>200</b>. The protective layer <b>204</b> is considered to &#x201c;cover&#x201d; the reactive layer <b>200</b> if the protective layer <b>204</b> covers enough of the reactive layer <b>200</b> to provide electrical discharge protection for the reactive layer <b>200</b>. The protective layer <b>204</b> can be formed of an electrically conductive metal such as aluminum, silver, gold, and so forth. Electrically conductive non-metallic materials can also be used in other implementations. In one example implementation, an aluminum foil can be laminated as a layer onto a surface of the reactive foil layer <b>200</b>. In another implementation, a paint containing an electrically conductive material (such as silver) can be coated onto the surface of the reactive foil layer <b>200</b>. Alternatively, a gold conductive layer can be sputter coated onto the surface of the reactive layer <b>200</b>. Thus, generally, the protective layer may be formed by laminating a conductive foil to the surface of the reactive layer <b>200</b>, by painting the surface of the reactive layer <b>200</b> with a conductive substance, or by sputtering a non-reactive, conductive material onto the reactive surface. Other techniques of forming an electrically conductive layer on a surface of the reactive layer <b>200</b> can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, the protective layer <b>204</b> is substantially more electrically conductive (in other words, possesses substantially less resistance) than the reactive layer <b>200</b>. In this manner, the protective conductive layer <b>204</b> serves as an electrical path to conduct induced ESD currents to ground. Since the electrical current passes through the conductive layer <b>204</b> and not the reactive layer <b>200</b>, the reactive material of the reactive layer <b>200</b> is not heated and no reaction takes place (so that activation of the activation assembly is avoided).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As furthered depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, electrically conductive leads or wires <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are connected to points on the reactive layer <b>200</b>. In the implementation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electrically conductive lead <b>206</b> is connected to a first side <b>210</b> of the reactive layer <b>200</b>, whereas the electrically conductive lead <b>208</b> is corrected to a second side <b>212</b> of the reactive layer <b>200</b>. In the example implementation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sides <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> are on opposite ends of the reactive layer <b>200</b>. In alternative implementations, the leads <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> can be connected to other sides of the reactive layer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electrically conductive leads <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are driven by the control unit <b>112</b>. The control unit <b>112</b> includes an energy storage device, such as a capacitor <b>214</b> or battery. In other implementations, other types of storage devices, such as batteries, can be employed in the control unit <b>112</b>. A switch <b>216</b> is connected between the capacitor <b>214</b> and the electrically conductive lead <b>208</b>. The switch <b>216</b> when in the open position isolates the energy stored in the capacitor <b>214</b> from the reactive layer <b>200</b>. However, in the closed position, the switch <b>216</b> electrically connects the energy in the capacitor <b>214</b> onto the electrically conductive lead <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The switch <b>216</b> is controlled by an integrated circuit (IC) device <b>218</b>. Alternatively, other types of controller devices can be used. The capacitor <b>214</b> is further coupled to an input voltage Vin, which is used to charge the capacitor <b>214</b> to a predetermined voltage. In a downhole environment, Vin can be coupled to an electrical conductor in the carrier line <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is run from the earth surface of the wellbore <b>102</b>. In an alternative implementation, the control unit <b>112</b> can be configured to receive optical signals that are transmitted over a fiber optic line (provided in the carrier line <b>104</b>), with the control unit <b>112</b> including a converter to convert the optical signals into electrical energy to charge the capacitor <b>114</b> (or other type of energy storage device).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, the tool <b>100</b> is run into the wellbore <b>102</b> to a target depth. At that point, electrical energy can be provided down the carrier line <b>104</b> to charge up the capacitor <b>214</b>. Next, an activate command can be sent down the carrier line <b>104</b>, which activate command is received by the IC device <b>218</b>. In response to the activate command, the IC device <b>218</b> closes the switch <b>216</b> to couple the electrical energy of the capacitor <b>214</b> onto the electrically conductive lead <b>208</b>. As a result, a voltage pulse is provided onto the electrically conductive leads <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, which causes an electrical current to pass through the reactive layer <b>200</b> to heat the reactive layer such that a reaction results. In some embodiments, the voltage pulse provided by the control unit <b>112</b> can be a relative low-voltage pulse. The reaction provided in the reactive layer <b>200</b> causes ignition of any explosive that is contacted to (or otherwise in sufficient close proximity to) the activation assembly <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the explosive can be a propellant stick <b>300</b>. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the propellant stick <b>300</b> has generally a cylindrical shape. Note, however, that the propellant <b>300</b> can have other shapes in other implementations. An activation assembly <b>108</b>A is wrapped around the propellant stick <b>300</b>, with the activation assembly <b>108</b>A having multiple layers <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> each generally being cylindrically shaped. The activation assembly <b>108</b>A includes an electrically conductive protective layer <b>302</b>, a reactive layer <b>304</b>, and a support structure <b>306</b>. The protective layer <b>302</b> provides ESD protection for the reactive layer <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The propellant stick <b>300</b> has a curved surface that extends along a direction that is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the propellant stick <b>300</b>. The activation assembly <b>108</b>A is wrapped around this curved surface of the propellant stick <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Electrically conductive leads <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> are connected to two opposite ends of the reactive layer <b>304</b>. When a voltage pulse is applied onto the electrically conductive leads <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, the reactive layer <b>304</b> is initiated. The initiated reactive layer <b>304</b> burns through the conductive layer <b>302</b> to cause initiation of the propellant stick <b>300</b>. The benefit offered by wrapping the activation assembly <b>108</b>A around the propellant stick <b>300</b> is that the entire outer surface of the propellant stick <b>300</b> (that is contacted to the activation assembly <b>108</b>A) can be ignited substantially simultaneously. In a fracturing operation, the simultaneous ignition of the entire surface of the propellant stick <b>300</b> allows more rapid pressurization without risk of fragmenting the propellant stick <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> illustrate another example embodiment, in which an explosive <b>400</b> (which can be a high explosive such as a primary explosive or secondary explosive) is activated by an activation assembly <b>108</b>B. The explosive <b>400</b> is also generally cylindrical in shape. Note, however, that the explosive <b>400</b> can have other shapes in other implementations. In the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, the activation assembly <b>108</b>B is generally shaped as a disk (although other shapes can be used in other embodiments). One surface <b>412</b> of the disk <b>108</b>B is contacted to an end surface <b>414</b> of the explosive <b>400</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Electrically conductive leads <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> are connected to the activation assembly <b>108</b>B. More specifically, the electrically conductive leads <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> are connected to the reactive layer <b>408</b> of the activation assembly <b>108</b>B (the reactive layer <b>408</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). The reactive layer <b>408</b> is provided between a support structure <b>410</b> and an electrically conductive protective layer <b>406</b> that provides the contact surface <b>412</b> of the activation assembly <b>108</b>B. As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electrically conductive layer <b>406</b> provides ESD protection against inadvertent initiation of the reactive layer <b>408</b>. Note that in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the protective layer <b>406</b> has two side portions <b>406</b>A, <b>406</b>B (bent at about right angles from the main part of the protective layer <b>406</b>) that are contacted to the sides of layers <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>. These side portions <b>406</b>A, <b>406</b>B provide further ESD protection. The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> depicts an arrangement in which the reactive layer <b>408</b> is completely enclosed by the combination of the support structure <b>410</b> and protective layer <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By using electrically conductive protective layers according to some embodiments, activation assemblies that include relatively sensitive pyrotechnic materials can be safely handled. In one example, the activation assembly that includes a pyrotechnic material can be desensitized so as to be resistant to an ESD stimulus up to about 20 mJ (milli-Joules). This is effective since a typical person can only accumulate an ESD charge of about 15 mJ. The values provided above are for purposes of example only. In other implementations, an activation assembly can be configured to withstand higher or lower ESD stimuli.</p>

It is intended that the appended claims cover such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
