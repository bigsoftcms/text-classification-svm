<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a fuel system and, more particularly, to a fuel system for protecting a fuel filter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Diesel engines typically rely on compression ignition, where fuel is injected into a combustion chamber after air has been compressed, resulting in substantially immediate combustion without requiring a sparkplug. Compression ignition diesel engines typically include a common rail fuel injection system, which directs pressurized fuel to individual fuel injectors for injection into the combustion chamber. Prior to entering the common rail, fuel is typically pumped through a primary filter and a secondary filter by a feed pump located between the filters. A high-pressure pump is typically located downstream of the secondary filter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In typical systems, a regulator valve positioned between the secondary filter and the high-pressure pump returns excess fuel (i.e., fuel in excess of a capacity of the high-pressure pump) to the inlet of the feed pump. Therefore, more fuel than necessary passes through the secondary filter, reducing the useful life of the secondary filter or otherwise requiring the secondary filter to be designed larger than necessary to handle the excess flow without reducing the useful life.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One attempt at preventing unnecessary flow across a filter of a fuel injection system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,520,162 (the '162 patent) issued to Schueler. The '162 patent discloses a common rail system provided with a pre-feed pump for delivering a fuel flow from a fuel tank to a high-pressure pump. The '162 patent also discloses a fuel filter disposed downstream of the pre-feed pump and a safety valve device that is dependent on a fuel filter pressure difference for shutting off flow through the filter, and a bypass to circumvent the safety valve device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the fuel injection system of the '162 patent may provide a method for protecting a fuel pump from damage due to abnormal conditions, it fails to provide a method for controlling fuel flow during normal conditions. Specifically, the '162 patent fails to prevent unnecessary flow across a fuel filter during normal operating conditions to extend the useful life of the filter or to allow for a smaller filter design area.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect, the present disclosure is directed toward a fuel system. The fuel system includes a first pump supplying fuel at a first pressure. The fuel system also includes a fuel filter fluidly connected downstream of the first pump. The fuel system further includes a second pump receiving fuel at a second pressure and fluidly connected downstream of the fuel filter. The fuel system additionally includes a first passage fluidly connecting an outlet of the first pump to an inlet of the first pump. The fuel system also includes a valve located within the first passage and configured to selectively allow fuel flow through the first passage. The fuel system further includes a second passage fluidly connecting an inlet of the second pump to the valve, wherein the second pressure acts on the valve to affect fuel at the first pressure to flow to the inlet of the first pump via the first passage when the second pressure is greater than a predetermined pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect, the present disclosure is directed toward a method for directing fuel flow. The method includes directing fuel from a first location at a first pressure to a second location at a second pressure. The method also includes filtering the fuel between the first and second locations. The method further includes pumping the fuel at a location downstream from the second location. The method additionally includes diverting an amount of fuel at the first pressure from the first location to a location upstream of the first location, when the second pressure exceeds a desired pressure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary fuel system <b>10</b>. Fuel system <b>10</b> may be a common rail fuel injection system and may include a fuel reservoir <b>11</b>, fluidly connected via a passage <b>20</b> to a filter <b>12</b>. A pump <b>13</b> may be fluidly connected downstream of filter <b>12</b> via a passage <b>21</b>, and may be fluidly connected upstream from a filter <b>14</b> via a passage <b>22</b>. Fuel system <b>10</b> may additionally include a pump <b>16</b> fluidly connected downstream from filter <b>14</b> via a passage <b>23</b>. A common rail <b>17</b> may be fluidly connected downstream from pump <b>16</b> via a passage <b>27</b> and may be fluidly connected upstream from a plurality of injectors <b>18</b> via a plurality of passages <b>29</b>. Injectors <b>18</b> may inject fuel into an engine (not shown) and may be fluidly connected to reservoir <b>11</b> via a leak return passage <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Filter <b>12</b> and filter <b>14</b> may be any suitable type of fuel filter known in the art such as, for example, a stainless steel or a plastic fuel filter. Filter <b>12</b> and filter <b>14</b> may serve to screen out rust, dirt, or other particles from the fuel. These particles may enter fuel system <b>10</b>, for example, when rust or paint chips are knocked into a fuel inlet during fueling or from rust that develops from moisture from water in reservoir <b>11</b>. Filter <b>12</b> may be a primary filter configured to remove larger particles than filter <b>14</b>, which may be a secondary filter configured to remove relatively small particles. This arrangement may allow the fuel to be filtered in a two-step process in which larger particles may be filtered via filter <b>12</b> and smaller particles may be filtered via filter <b>14</b>. By removing foreign material from the fuel, filter <b>12</b> and filter <b>14</b> may serve to prevent abrasive wear by the particles on fuel injectors <b>18</b>. Filter <b>12</b> and filter <b>14</b> may also allow the engine to operate more efficiently, as uncontaminated fuel may burn more efficiently than contaminated fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Pump <b>13</b> may be a swash plate pump, having a rotating cylinder (not shown) containing pistons (not shown). A spring (not shown) may force the pistons against a swash plate (not shown), the swash plate being oriented at an angle to the pistons. As the swash plate rotates relative to the pistons, the pistons receive fluid during the first half of each revolution and force fluid out at an elevated pressure during the second half. The swash plate angle may be varied, with the amount of fuel transferred increasing as the angle of the swash plate increases. It is contemplated that pump <b>13</b> may also be a gear pump or a vane pump. Pump <b>13</b> may serve as a feed pump to direct fuel from reservoir <b>11</b>, through filter <b>12</b> and filter <b>14</b>, and into pump <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Pump <b>16</b> may be any type of high-pressure pump known in the art that is suitable for common rail fuel injection. Pump <b>16</b> may include a housing (not shown) defining a plurality of barrels (not shown). Plungers (not shown) may be slidably disposed within each barrel, defining pumping chambers. The plungers may be driven by any suitable actuator known in the art such as, for example, a cam, a solenoid actuator, a piezo actuator, a hydraulic actuator, or a motor. Pump <b>16</b> may serve to maintain fuel stored within a reservoir (not shown) of common rail <b>17</b> at a relatively high-pressure. Pump <b>13</b> and pump <b>16</b> may be either engine-driven or independently driven.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Common rail <b>17</b> may be an intake manifold configured to distribute the flow of pressurized fluid from pump <b>16</b>. Common rail <b>17</b> may be configured to distribute fuel to injectors <b>18</b> via passages <b>29</b>. Common rail <b>17</b> and injectors <b>18</b> may be associated with a controller (not shown) that may control an actuation timing, pressure, and duration of fuel injected by fuel injectors <b>18</b>. By injecting pressurized fuel at optimal times during engine operation, for example at the end of a compression stroke of the engine, common rail <b>17</b> and injectors <b>18</b> may provide for better fuel atomization and thereby better engine efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fuel system <b>10</b> may also include a regulator valve <b>19</b> for controlling the amount of flow passing through filter <b>14</b>. Regulator valve <b>19</b> may be configured to use hydraulic feedback to adjust fuel flow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, regulator valve <b>19</b> may include a housing <b>33</b>, which may provide a bearing surface for a spring <b>37</b> located within a spring cavity <b>35</b> of housing <b>33</b>. Regulator valve <b>19</b> may further include a plunger <b>39</b>, which may be housed within housing <b>33</b>. A first end <b>43</b> of plunger <b>39</b> may be connected to spring <b>37</b>, so that displacement of plunger <b>39</b> may cause an expansion or contraction of spring <b>37</b>. Spring <b>37</b> may be pre-loaded so that it biases plunger <b>39</b> against a seat <b>41</b> of housing <b>33</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a passage <b>25</b> may be fluidly connected to housing <b>33</b> at a location on a first side of seat <b>41</b>, and a passage <b>26</b> may be fluidly connected to spring cavity <b>35</b> of housing <b>33</b> at a location on a second side (opposite to the first side) of seat <b>41</b>. A passage <b>24</b> may be fluidly connected to housing <b>33</b>, where passage <b>24</b> may be adjacent to a second end <b>45</b> of plunger <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The pressure of pressurized fluid in passage <b>24</b> may act on second end <b>45</b> of plunger <b>39</b>, exerting a force against plunger <b>39</b>. The force exerted may exceed the pre-loading in spring <b>37</b>, which may cause spring <b>37</b> to contract and allow movement of plunger <b>39</b>. The pre-loading in spring <b>37</b> may be equivalent to a predetermined pressure (e.g., a desired inlet pressure) of pump <b>16</b>. If the pressure at the inlet of pump <b>16</b> and passage <b>24</b> exceeds the desired pressure, plunger <b>39</b> may move away from seat <b>41</b>, establishing a fluid connection between passage <b>25</b>, spring cavity <b>35</b>, and passage <b>26</b>. Regulator valve <b>19</b> may direct excess fuel flow from an outlet of pump <b>13</b> to an inlet of pump <b>13</b>, via passage <b>25</b> and passage <b>26</b>, thereby diverting excess fuel from filter <b>14</b>. Thus, regulator valve <b>19</b> may be configured to selectively permit fuel to flow from the outlet of pump <b>13</b> to the inlet of pump <b>13</b> as a function of the pressure at the inlet of pump <b>16</b>. As the fuel flow is diverted from filter <b>14</b> and the inlet of pump <b>16</b>, the pressure of pressurized fluid in passage <b>24</b> may decrease, allowing spring <b>37</b> to expand and closing regulator valve <b>19</b> to substantially block flow between passage <b>25</b> and passage <b>26</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosed fuel injection system may prolong the useful life of fuel filter <b>14</b> by utilizing regulator valve <b>19</b> for maintaining a flow across filter <b>14</b> that maintains a desired pressure at the inlet of pump <b>16</b>. By maintaining the desired pressure, the useful life of fuel filter <b>14</b> may be prolonged and/or a smaller filter design area may be used, resulting in cost savings.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, pump <b>13</b> may pump fuel from reservoir <b>11</b> to pump <b>16</b> through passages <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>, filter <b>12</b>, and filter <b>14</b>. Regulator valve <b>19</b> may maintain a pressure P<b>3</b> at the inlet to pump <b>16</b> at a desired inlet pressure, optimal for operation of pump <b>16</b>. Pressure P<b>3</b> at the inlet of pump <b>16</b> may act via passage <b>24</b> on second end <b>45</b> of plunger <b>39</b>, exerting a force (i.e., pressure P<b>3</b> multiplied by the area of end <b>45</b>) against plunger <b>39</b>. When pressure P<b>3</b> exceeds the desired inlet pressure of pump <b>16</b>, the force exerted may cause spring <b>37</b> to contract and allow plunger <b>39</b> to move away from seat <b>41</b>. A fluid connection between passage <b>25</b>, spring cavity <b>35</b>, and passage <b>26</b> may be established. Fuel at a pressure P<b>2</b> at the outlet of pump <b>13</b> may flow from the outlet of pump <b>13</b> to the inlet of pump <b>13</b>, via passage <b>25</b> and passage <b>26</b>, thereby diverting excess fuel flow from filter <b>14</b>. Fuel at the inlet of pump <b>13</b> may be pressurized at a pressure P<b>1</b>. As the fuel flow is diverted from filter <b>14</b> and the inlet of pump <b>16</b>, pressure P<b>3</b> at the inlet to pump <b>16</b> may decrease until equal to the desired pressure, allowing spring <b>37</b> to expand and closing regulator valve <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fuel system <b>10</b> may help to reduce costs associated with fuel filter <b>14</b>. Fuel system <b>10</b> may prolong the useful life of fuel filter <b>14</b> by utilizing regulator valve <b>19</b> to maintain a flow across filter <b>14</b> that corresponds to the desired pressure at the inlet of pump <b>16</b>. By preventing unnecessary flow in this manner, the useful life of filter <b>14</b> may be prolonged. By preventing unnecessary flow, the design area of filter <b>14</b> may also be reduced, which may result in cost savings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed fuel system.
