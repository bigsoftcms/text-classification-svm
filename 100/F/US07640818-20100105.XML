<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transmission is provided having a dual clutch, to achieve torque flow through a countershaft gearing arrangement. The countershaft gearing arrangement includes a plurality of co-planar gear sets having gears that are selectively connectable to a plurality of countershafts. At least one transfer gear set transfers torque from the counter shafts to an output shaft. The output shaft is connected to a final drive unit that has a final drive unit output shaft that is transverse to an input member connected at one end to a torque converter and at the other end to the dual clutch.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having a countershaft gearing arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve &#x201c;power-on&#x201d; or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other, with the synchronizers being &#x201c;pre-selected&#x201d; for the oncoming ratio prior to actually making the dynamic shift. &#x201c;Power-on&#x201d; shifting means that torque flow from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly, the total number of gears required in this typical design is two times the number of forward speeds, plus three for reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear pairs, especially in transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed ratios.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an aspect of the present invention a powertrain having a transmission input member, a power source for generating a torque in the input member, a first intermediate shaft, a second intermediate shaft concentric with the first intermediate shaft, a clutch, countershaft, a first and second set of gears, an output shaft and a first transfer gear is provided. The clutch is selectively engagable to couple the transmission input member with one of the first and second intermediate shafts. The first set of gears are connected for common rotation with the first intermediate shaft and intermesh with a first selectable set of gears to form a first plurality of co-planar gear sets, wherein each of the gears of the first selectable set of gears is connectable for common rotation with one of the countershaft and the output shaft for selectively transferring the torque when the clutch is engaged. The second set of gears is connected for common rotation with the second intermediate shaft and intermesh with a second selectable set of gears to form a second plurality of co-planar gear sets, wherein each of the gears of the second selectable set of gears is connectable for common rotation with one of countershaft and the output shaft for selectively transferring the torque when the clutch is engaged. The output shaft is disposed radially outward of the second intermediate shaft. The first transfer gear is coupled to one of the first and second countershafts for transferring torque from the countershaft to the output shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another aspect of the present invention, the first set of gears further includes two gears.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect of the present invention, the second set of gears further comprises three gears.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect of the present invention, the powertrain further includes a first idler gear rotatable about a first idler axis and intermeshing with at least one of the selectable sets of gears of the first set of gears.</p>
