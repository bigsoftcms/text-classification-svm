<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref> are directed to a dual pump apparatus and depict different embodiments thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 60</figref> are directed to various modules incorporating, among other things, a dual pump apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">One embodiment of this invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, which depict a pump apparatus <b>10</b> having a unitary housing <b>12</b>. In the embodiment described below, two generally identical pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are disclosed within unitary housing <b>12</b>, and identical numerals with the letters a and b are used to reference identical parts. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>need not be identical and that substantial variations are possible to one or the other within the scope of this invention. Pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are shown as the rotating axial piston type, although other designs could be used with minor modifications within the scope of this invention. For convenience, only certain elements of pump <b>11</b><i>a </i>and its related structure are described in detail herein. It will be understood that the corresponding structure of pump <b>11</b><i>b </i>is identical in the embodiments depicted and need not be similarly described.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Housing <b>12</b> forms two generally identical pump chambers or cavities <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>and a gear chamber or cavity <b>30</b> formed therebetween, thus providing an integral housing for pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. A pair of end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are mounted on opposite ends of housing <b>12</b> and act to seal pump chambers <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b</i>, and may be secured thereto by screws <b>22</b> or another means. A cover <b>23</b> is secured to the bottom of housing <b>12</b> to close gear chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With regard to pump <b>11</b><i>a </i>on the left hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, it can be seen that a pump cylinder block <b>31</b><i>a </i>comprising a plurality of axial pistons <b>38</b><i>a </i>is mounted on running plate <b>37</b><i>a</i>, which may be used for additional strength and durability. Cylinder block <b>31</b><i>a </i>could also run directly on a surface formed on end cap <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The porting in end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be of the design shown in e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,332,393, the terms of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">End cap <b>16</b><i>a </i>includes hydraulic porting <b>26</b><i>a </i>for the hydraulic fluid. System ports <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>a </i>are formed on the external surface thereof. In the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, plugs <b>43</b> are used to seal system ports <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>for shipping; in use the system ports would be connected to hoses or the like. As shown in the schematic depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, ports <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>a </i>are connected to motor <b>40</b><i>a </i>while ports <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>are connected to motor <b>40</b><i>b</i>. Motors <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>could be wheel motors in a typical zero turn vehicle design; they could also be replaced with other hydraulic devices in other applications. A bypass <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b </i>is provided for each pump <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>to permit, e.g., movement of the vehicle when it is not under power.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Pump <b>11</b><i>a </i>is of the cradle mounted swash plate design; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, swash plate <b>32</b><i>a </i>is mounted in pump chamber <b>29</b><i>a </i>on cradle bearings <b>46</b><i>a </i>mounted on the inner wall of housing <b>12</b>. Pistons <b>38</b><i>a </i>run against swash bearing <b>33</b><i>a </i>mounted in swash plate <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Trunnion arm <b>21</b><i>a </i>is engaged to a control block <b>45</b><i>a </i>that is engaged to swash plate <b>32</b><i>a</i>, so that rotation of trunnion arm <b>21</b><i>a </i>causes movement of swash plate <b>32</b><i>a </i>to the various stroked forward or reverse positions, or to the neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an external reservoir <b>68</b> is used for storing hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid is pulled from reservoir <b>68</b> through filter <b>65</b> into charge inlets <b>47</b><i>a </i>and <b>47</b><i>b</i>, and hence to charge pumps <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Charged fluid is driven into charge gallery <b>49</b><i>a </i>and then to the porting in end cap <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and a charge relief <b>75</b><i>a </i>is provided to keep pressures within the normal operating range. Since in this embodiment pump chambers <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>are sealed from one another, a plurality of case drains <b>69</b><i>a </i>and <b>69</b><i>b </i>are provided to remove oil from pump chambers <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The separate case drains <b>69</b><i>a </i>and <b>69</b><i>b </i>may be located in a variety of locations, such as end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Check valves <b>67</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>b </i>are used to maintain the proper hydraulic flow within end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. A pair of charge pressure relief valves <b>75</b><i>a </i>and <b>75</b><i>b </i>is connected to the porting for charge pumps <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Input shaft <b>14</b> extends into housing <b>12</b>; it can be driven by a prime mover such as engine <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> through a pulley, such as pulley <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or some other means. Bevel gear <b>36</b> is mounted on input shaft <b>14</b> inside gear chamber <b>30</b> and is drivingly engaged to a second bevel gear <b>35</b> mounted on first pump shaft <b>27</b>. Pump shaft <b>27</b> extends from gear chamber <b>30</b> into first pump chamber <b>29</b><i>a </i>and is engaged to and drivingly rotates pump cylinder block <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Bearing <b>44</b><i>a </i>provides support within housing <b>12</b>. Pump shaft <b>27</b> is joined to and drives shaft <b>28</b> through coupler <b>34</b>, which may be of a known design using a powdered metal part with splines to interlock shafts <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>, or a cut steel part with a broached inner diameter to form the interlock, or a similar design. Pump shaft <b>28</b> also extends from gear chamber <b>30</b> into pump chamber <b>29</b><i>b </i>where it engages and drivingly rotates pump cylinder block <b>31</b><i>b </i>in a similar manner. As shown in, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, input shaft <b>14</b> is generally perpendicular to pump shafts <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> and extends out the side of housing <b>12</b> as opposed to the ends thereof, which provides the user with flexibility in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, input shaft <b>27</b> extends through end cap <b>16</b><i>a </i>into charge housing <b>20</b><i>a </i>to drive charge pump <b>18</b><i>a</i>, which can be a gerotor style such as is shown or some other style of charge pump, such as a vane pump, geroller, gear pump or any other known design. End cap <b>16</b><i>a </i>may be secured to housing <b>12</b> by means of screws <b>24</b> or the like. The location of input shaft <b>14</b> on the side of housing <b>12</b> permits the location of charge pumps <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>on opposite ends of housing <b>12</b>. Specifically, charge pump <b>18</b><i>a </i>is located within charge pump housing <b>20</b><i>a </i>mounted on end cap <b>16</b><i>a</i>. A similar charge pump <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be mounted in a similar manner in charge pump housing <b>20</b><i>b </i>on the other end of apparatus <b>10</b>. It is possible that only one of the charge pumps would be required, depending on the application for which the pump apparatus <b>10</b> is to be used. Similarly, the output of one charge pump mounted on one end cap could be attached by means of internal or external hoses or integral passages to provide charge pressure to the other pump associated with the other end cap.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It will also be understood that these embodiments could include additional gear reduction. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a gear reduction could be used between bevel gear <b>36</b> on input shaft <b>14</b> and bevel gear <b>35</b> on pump shaft <b>27</b>. Furthermore, it will be understood that bevel gears <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> could be replaced with another means for creating a right angle turn of the rotational force, such as helical gears, a worm gear driving a spur gear and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a second embodiment of this invention, where like numerals indicate identical structure with previous figures. A pump apparatus <b>50</b> has a housing <b>52</b> which creates a gear chamber <b>56</b> and a first pump chamber <b>59</b><i>a </i>and a second pump chamber <b>59</b><i>b</i>. A case fluid passage <b>55</b><i>a </i>is formed in housing <b>52</b> to connect pump chamber <b>59</b><i>a </i>and gear chamber <b>56</b>, and case fluid passage <b>55</b><i>b </i>similarly connects pump chamber <b>59</b><i>b </i>with gear chamber <b>56</b>, both to permit hydraulic oil to flow between the pump chambers <b>59</b><i>a </i>and <b>59</b><i>b </i>and the gear chamber <b>56</b>. Since both pump chambers <b>59</b><i>a </i>and <b>59</b><i>b </i>and gear chamber <b>56</b> are hydraulically connected in this embodiment, a single case drain <b>69</b> to permit oil to flow to reservoir <b>68</b> can be formed anywhere in housing <b>52</b>; if it is in the gear chamber <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it will assist in preventing contamination of pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>with debris from bevel gears <b>36</b>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b </i>and assist in reduction of heat, as the warmer fluid from pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>will be carried to the center of housing <b>52</b>. It could, however, be formed elsewhere in the circuit depending on the application requirements. The use of a single case drain also reduces machining requirements and the number of fittings required.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this second embodiment, input shaft <b>54</b> is driven by input pulley <b>51</b> and extends through housing <b>52</b>, and through cover <b>53</b>, which includes bearing <b>57</b> therein to support shaft <b>54</b>. Output pulley <b>58</b> may be attached to the end of shaft <b>54</b> to drive an auxiliary device such as a mower deck or other device. Cover <b>53</b> is strengthened to support bearing <b>57</b> used to rotatably support shaft <b>54</b> and the torque loads from output pulley <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It will be noted that using through shaft <b>54</b> as the input shaft precludes the use of a coupler to drive pump input shafts <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b</i>. An alternative means of driving these shafts is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where input shaft <b>54</b> has a first bevel gear <b>36</b> mounted thereon and drivingly engaged to a first driven bevel gear <b>35</b><i>a </i>mounted on and driving first pump shaft <b>63</b><i>a </i>and a second driven bevel gear <b>35</b><i>b </i>which is similarly mounted on and driving second pump shaft <b>63</b><i>b</i>. Such an alternative arrangement could also be used with the first embodiment in place of coupler <b>34</b>. A further benefit of this design is that pump shafts <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>can be sized appropriately for pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>; only input shaft <b>54</b> needs to be sized appropriately to handle the torque of both pumps <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>as well as the torque requirements of an auxiliary device attached to output pulley <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A third embodiment of this invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is similar in many ways to the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Pump apparatus <b>70</b> includes a housing <b>72</b> with cover <b>73</b> secured thereto. Input shaft <b>74</b> extends through housing <b>72</b> and cover <b>73</b>, where it is supported by bearing <b>77</b>, to extend out of gear chamber <b>56</b> to drive auxiliary pump <b>78</b> through coupler <b>76</b>, which also may be of the internal spline structure or other known structure. Auxiliary pump <b>78</b> could alternatively be driven directly by input shaft <b>74</b>, thus eliminating the need for coupler <b>76</b>. Optional hardened washers <b>25</b> may be mounted adjacent to gears <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>and <b>36</b> to provide support for such gears running against housing <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Auxiliary pump <b>78</b> is mounted in auxiliary pump housing <b>79</b> mounted on cover <b>73</b>, and it can be used for driving external devices such as a deck lift or the like. The auxiliary out and auxiliary return are depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As with the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, this embodiment requires only a single case drain <b>69</b> to reservoir <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Yet another embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is structurally substantially identical to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a pump apparatus <b>80</b>, where the key differences with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are that pump shafts <b>87</b> and <b>88</b> extend out of charge pump housings <b>82</b><i>a </i>and <b>82</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and input shaft <b>84</b> extends out of cover <b>83</b>. A plurality of cooling fans <b>81</b><i>a </i>and <b>82</b><i>b </i>are mounted on pump shafts <b>87</b> and <b>88</b> respectively, while fan <b>81</b><i>c </i>may be mounted on input shaft <b>84</b>. It is unlikely, though possible, that all three fans <b>81</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>would be needed for a single application.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">One or more of fans <b>81</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be used depending on the application needs and if <b>81</b><i>a </i>and <b>81</b><i>b </i>are placed in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, so as to move air in the same direction, they may cooperate to generate a draft across housing <b>12</b> and reduce airflow turbulence. The use of such fans can in certain applications eliminate the need for an oil cooler. The most advantageous arrangement of the fans will depend on how apparatus <b>80</b> is located with respect to, e.g., a vehicle engine or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A fifth embodiment of this invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, where pump apparatus <b>90</b> has a housing <b>92</b>. This embodiment is similar in many ways to the previous embodiments and in particular the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> in terms of the arrangements of those items using identical numerals. The key difference in this embodiment is the use of a single charge pump <b>98</b> driven by input shaft <b>94</b> rather than a pair of charge pumps driven by pump shafts <b>93</b><i>a </i>and <b>93</b><i>b</i>. Charge pump <b>98</b> is mounted in a housing <b>99</b> secured to cover <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As will be understood, a described arrangement requires porting to be formed in both cover <b>95</b> and housing <b>92</b> to permit charge oil flow to pump cylinder blocks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>. It would also be understood that such porting could be formed externally, e.g., through hoses and the requisite fittings connecting charge pump <b>98</b> to end caps <b>96</b><i>a </i>and <b>96</b><i>b</i>. Input shaft <b>94</b> extends through cover <b>95</b> to drive charge pump <b>98</b>. The input shaft may be further supported by bearing <b>77</b>. An additional bearing <b>97</b> may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, housing <b>92</b> and cover <b>95</b> include a port <b>102</b> having a first leg <b>102</b><i>a </i>extending into the left side of housing <b>92</b> and into end cap <b>96</b><i>a</i>, and a second leg <b>102</b><i>b </i>extending opposite thereto and through the right side of housing <b>92</b> and into second end cap <b>96</b><i>b</i>. Charge inlet <b>104</b> is formed in cover <b>95</b> and connects charge pump <b>98</b> to reservoir <b>68</b>, as shown in the schematic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, bearing <b>97</b> also serves to divide charge inlet <b>104</b> from port <b>102</b>. End caps <b>96</b><i>a </i>and <b>96</b><i>b</i>, which are secured to housing <b>92</b> by screws <b>22</b> or other fastening means, may be generally identical and thus only one will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">End cap <b>96</b><i>a </i>has a pair of system ports <b>105</b>, each of which has a corresponding poppet valve <b>106</b> connecting the kidneys <b>107</b> to the system ports <b>105</b>. A screw type bypass <b>108</b> can be used with a bypass port <b>109</b> connecting the two sides of the hydraulic circuit to enable the user to place the unit into bypass. The key distinction from the prior embodiments is the use of single charge port <b>103</b>, which may be drilled into end cap <b>96</b><i>a</i>, and which connects to port <b>102</b><i>a </i>to provide charge fluid from charge pump <b>98</b> to the hydraulic circuit of pump <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As can be seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a mounting flange <b>110</b> can be formed on housing <b>92</b> to provide a means for securing the pump apparatus to a vehicle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">One of the benefits of this invention is that the design affords flexibility to the user for different possible applications. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>are shown extending out of housing <b>12</b> on the same side as and thus parallel to input shaft <b>14</b>. It will be understood that trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>could be mounted on any side of housing <b>12</b>, possibly requiring a corresponding change in the orientation of swash plates <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and also possibly requiring a change in the orientation of end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>need not be on the same side of housing <b>12</b>. By way of example, if trunnion arm <b>21</b><i>a </i>is rotated 180&#xb0; from the orientation shown, housing <b>12</b> would need to be modified, but the orientation of end cap <b>16</b><i>a </i>would not need to be changed. If, however, trunnion arm <b>21</b><i>a </i>was rotated 90&#xb0; from the orientation shown, end cap <b>16</b><i>a </i>would also need to be similarly rotated, along with the proper housing modifications. These changes are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Specifically, a view of such an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, where pump apparatus <b>210</b> includes a slightly modified housing <b>212</b>, where trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>are mounted on the same side of housing <b>212</b>, but at a 90 degree angle from input shaft <b>14</b>, so that trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>are perpendicular to both the two pump shafts <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> and input shaft <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a slightly modified embodiment pump apparatus <b>310</b>, where trunnion arms <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>are mounted on opposite sides of housing <b>312</b>. These changes are helpful to ensure that the unit can be installed in a wide variety of applications. For example, different vehicle applications use different linkages, and the ability to modify the pump housing in such manners affords the user maximum flexibility. It will also be understood that other types of swash plates <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, such as a trunnion mounted swash plate, could also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Another area where this invention provides increased flexibility is in the possible locations of the system ports. For example, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, system ports <b>105</b> are located on the side of end cap <b>96</b><i>a </i>adjacent to mounting flange <b>110</b>. In these embodiments, system ports <b>105</b> are parallel to the longitudinal axis of input shaft <b>94</b>. This is in contrast to, e.g., the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>, where system ports <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>are formed in end caps <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, respectively, so as to be perpendicular to input shaft <b>14</b>. These different embodiments again increase the flexibility afforded to the user of this design, so that it may be used in a wide variety of vehicles or other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an alternative embodiment similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, except that charge pump <b>112</b> is mounted on the inside of cover <b>111</b>, and thus inside the fluid sump formed inside housing <b>92</b>. Cover <b>113</b> is formed to mount not only charge pump <b>112</b> but also bearing <b>77</b> for input shaft <b>114</b>. Porting similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> will be formed in cover <b>111</b> to connect to ports <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The tandem pump arrangements discussed above could be used in a module for installation in a vehicle such as a tractor, riding lawn mower or the like. Such uses are exemplary, as other uses of the pump and motor modules disclosed herein will be obvious to one of skill in the art. The module may be a pump apparatus and a pair of wheel motors, or a pump apparatus and an engine, or a pump apparatus with both the wheel motors and the engine, depending on the application. Various embodiments of the modules in accordance with the present invention are depicted in the drawings attached hereto as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 60</figref>. These embodiments are discussed in detail below; the details of the pump apparatus used in the various modules are not discussed with respect to the figures.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It will be understood by those of skill in the art that various embodiments of hydraulic pumps, such as are described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref>, can be used in connection with these modules.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 24</figref> show a first embodiment of such a module <b>115</b> in accordance with the present invention. Vehicle <b>120</b> comprises a frame <b>125</b>, control mechanism <b>123</b>, mower deck <b>127</b>, deck drive system <b>117</b> and prime mover <b>121</b>. Other known elements of such exemplary vehicles are not critical to this invention and will not be described herein.

Each wheel motor <b>140</b> has a drive axle <b>128</b> extending therefrom to drive its corresponding wheel <b>129</b>. The details of wheel motors <b>140</b> are not critical to this invention and will not be described herein. A known motor design is shown in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,811,510, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other motor designs could be used with the modules of the present invention depending on the application. The disclosure herein assumes that both wheel motors are identical, as this is preferred due to issues such as cost and ease of assembly. It will be understood, however, that such identity is not required within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the following discussions, reference may be made to drive modules and hydraulic modules; for example, drive module <b>115</b> and hydraulic module <b>130</b>. A drive module is generally an assembly that may include a hydraulic module, wheel motors, prime mover or engine, and all brackets, fasteners, lines and other elements required to accomplish the drive function for a vehicle. A hydraulic module generally has a pump apparatus, motors or wheel motors, and all other elements required to form a hydraulic subassembly suitable for mounting into a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>, each motor <b>140</b> is connected to a corresponding end cap <b>116</b><i>a </i>or <b>116</b><i>b </i>of pump apparatus <b>150</b> by means of a pair of fluid passages <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>to provide high and low pressure flow between the pump apparatus <b>150</b> and motors <b>140</b>. As shown most clearly in the schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, additional porting or tubes <b>133</b><i>a </i>are used to provide an inlet flow between reservoir <b>168</b> and pump apparatus <b>150</b>, through filters <b>165</b>. Tubes <b>133</b><i>b </i>provide a return flow from pump apparatus <b>150</b> to reservoir <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The embodiment depicted in these figures is of the direct drive type, where coupler <b>134</b> connects engine output <b>183</b> to pump input shaft <b>154</b>. Output pulley <b>158</b> is mounted on the opposite side of pump shaft <b>154</b> and is used to engage and drive deck drive system <b>117</b> and mower deck <b>127</b>. An electric clutch <b>160</b> may optionally be used to control this engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A series of brackets are used to connect the various elements of module <b>115</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 24</figref>, these brackets include mounting platform <b>136</b>, pump mounting bracket <b>131</b>, stabilizing brackets <b>135</b>, mounting plates <b>126</b>, motor mounting bracket <b>137</b>, and crossbar stabilizer <b>142</b>. Stabilizing bracket <b>135</b> is shown in more detail in FIG. <b>23</b>, while motor mounting bracket <b>137</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The names given these various brackets are for convenience and should not be read as limiting. As will be understood, these brackets are secured together by fasteners such as bolts <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>146</b>; other fastening means could also be used. The number, size and location of the fastening means will be known to those of skill in the art and will depend on the application parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In certain situations, the module may require additional stabilizing beyond that provided by the various bracket members. A crossbar stabilizer <b>142</b> may be used in such instances, and its opposite ends extend through openings in various brackets and motors <b>140</b> that would otherwise be used for fasteners. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref>, for example, stabilizer bar <b>142</b> is positioned by nuts <b>147</b> between stabilizing brackets <b>135</b>, and then extends through each bracket <b>153</b>, through motor mounting bracket <b>137</b> and then through motor <b>140</b>, with another nut <b>147</b> to complete the attachment of stabilizer bar <b>142</b> to drive module <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Engine <b>121</b> is positioned on a mounting platform <b>136</b> that comprises a generally flat area to which engine <b>121</b> is secured by means of mounting fasteners <b>144</b>.

Mounting plate <b>126</b> may be formed as a part of vehicle frame <b>125</b> or may be attached to vehicle frame <b>125</b> by fasteners or other methods, such as welding.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Stabilizing bracket <b>135</b> is shown separately in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and from a top view as a part of hydraulic module <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. It comprises a first portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>for support of one of the hydraulic motors <b>140</b> and includes an opening <b>135</b><i>d </i>to receive motor <b>140</b>, a second portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>for attachment to one of the end caps <b>116</b> of pump assembly <b>150</b> and includes opening <b>135</b><i>f </i>to receive charge pump cover <b>118</b>, and a connecting portion <b>135</b><i>c </i>joined to both sections <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b </i>at a generally perpendicular angle. Second portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>includes an extended tab having slot <b>135</b><i>g </i>formed therein, to permit control arms <b>124</b> of pump apparatus <b>150</b> to extend therethrough. Portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>of stabilizing bracket <b>135</b> may be attached to pump apparatus <b>150</b> in a variety of locations. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, stabilizing bracket <b>135</b> is attached to pump module <b>150</b> by fasteners <b>122</b>, which also serve to attach end cap <b>116</b> to pump apparatus <b>150</b>.

Adjacent to gear cavity cover <b>153</b> is a pulley <b>158</b>. Shaft <b>154</b> extends through pulley <b>158</b> into clutch <b>160</b>, which is shown as an electric clutch. Clutch <b>160</b> uses an anti-rotation pin <b>161</b> to keep clutch <b>160</b> from spinning. Pin <b>161</b> may be attached to a bracket <b>162</b>. Bracket <b>162</b> may be attached to pump apparatus <b>150</b> by fasteners <b>163</b>, which also attaches gear cavity cover to housing <b>152</b> of pump apparatus <b>150</b>. Clutch <b>160</b> may then be selectively engaged by a vehicle operator to connect shaft <b>154</b> to pulley <b>158</b>, which may then drive a feature such as mower deck <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Hydraulic module <b>130</b> permits a manufacturer to assemble various elements of pumps and motors, including those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, and either attach a prime mover such as prime mover <b>121</b> to form drive assembly or module <b>115</b>, or transport hydraulic module <b>130</b> to another location for further assembly. Drive module <b>115</b> and hydraulic module <b>130</b> provide clearance <b>148</b> to permit sliding either drive module <b>115</b> or hydraulic module <b>130</b> from the rear of vehicle <b>120</b> toward the front of a vehicle <b>120</b> over frame rails <b>125</b> and any associated elements, such as mounting plate <b>126</b>. Thus, drive module <b>115</b> and hydraulic module <b>130</b> provide an assembly that can easily be manufactured and transported to a vehicle manufacturer for assembly into a vehicle, reducing vehicle assembly time and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 to 30</figref> depict another embodiment of this invention, and in particular a vehicle <b>220</b> including a drive module <b>215</b>. As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a bell housing <b>231</b> is integrally formed as part of housing <b>252</b> of pump apparatus <b>250</b>. Bell housing <b>231</b> is then secured to the underside of mounting platform <b>236</b> by means of fasteners <b>144</b> or other fastening means. Stabilizing brackets <b>235</b> are used to connect wheel motors <b>140</b> with end caps <b>116</b><i>a </i>and <b>116</b><i>b </i>of pump assembly <b>250</b>. Crossbar stabilizer <b>142</b> is again used to provide additional support and stability. Control arms <b>224</b> extend from the top side of dual pump apparatus <b>250</b>. This embodiment permits a simplified support of pump apparatus <b>250</b> as compared to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 24</figref>. Use of bell housing <b>231</b> reduces the complexity of drive module <b>215</b> as compared to drive module <b>115</b>, providing additional clearance for vehicle elements that may need to be connected to drive module <b>215</b> or may need to pass from one side of module <b>215</b> to the other side of module <b>215</b>. Note that bell housing <b>231</b> may be attached directly to prime mover <b>121</b> through an opening formed in mounting platform <b>236</b> (not shown), or it may be positioned adjacent to the lower surface of mounting platform <b>236</b> and attached to mounting platform <b>236</b> or to prime mover <b>121</b> by fasteners (not shown) that penetrate mounting platform <b>236</b> through clearance holes (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A further embodiment of a vehicle <b>320</b> having a pump and engine module <b>315</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 to 34</figref>. Stabilizing brackets <b>335</b> are secured to vehicle <b>320</b> frame <b>325</b> by attachment to mounting plates <b>326</b> with fasteners <b>346</b>. Mounting platform <b>336</b> is also attached to mounting plate <b>326</b> by fasteners <b>343</b>. Stabilizing brackets <b>335</b> may also be secured to pump mounting bracket <b>131</b> by fasteners <b>145</b>. As previously described, pump mounting bracket <b>131</b> may be attached to prime mover <b>121</b> by fasteners <b>144</b>. As in a previously described embodiment, mounting plate <b>326</b> is secured to frame <b>325</b> by fasteners or a technique such as welding. Stabilizing bracket <b>335</b> may be similar in construction to stabilizing bracket <b>135</b> described above. This embodiment demonstrates that wheel motors <b>140</b> may be offset lower than pump apparatus <b>350</b> with respect to the ground; minor modifications such as to the shape of passages <b>332</b><i>a </i>and <b>332</b><i>b </i>can be made to accommodate such an offset. Further differences include the location of pulley <b>158</b> below electric clutch <b>160</b>. In addition, four stabilizer bars <b>142</b> are used; two are shown in the front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 34</figref>; two more can be located in the corresponding rear positions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Flanges <b>336</b><i>b </i>are formed on the fore and aft sides of platform <b>336</b> to provide stiffness to support the weight of engine <b>121</b> and resist excessive torquing of vehicle frame.</p>
