<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Launch devices, such as missiles, need to be mated to launch platforms. Some of the existing solutions are non-automated and require human operators at the launch site, utilize in-ground and/or silo launches in launch tubes, and/or utilize missiles stacked in stages on the launch platform. However, non-automated solutions requiring human operation may reduce speed of deployment and increase safety issues. In-ground and silo launches may lead to political issues because they may be confused with nuclear strikes. Missiles which are stacked in stages on the launch platform may require increased cost and/or time.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An automated system and/or method for mating a launch device to a launch platform is needed to decrease one or more problems associated with one or more of the existing systems and/or methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one aspect of the disclosure, an automated system for mating a launch device to a launch platform may comprise the following: a launch platform comprising a first electrical connector; and a interface member attached to a launch device which is configured to be launched from the launch platform. The interface member may comprise a second electrical connector configured to couple to the first electrical connector of the launch platform.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another aspect of the disclosure, a method for automatically mating a launch device to a launch platform is disclosed. In one step, a launch platform may be provided comprising a first electrical connector. In another step, a launch device may be provided comprising a interface member. The interface member may comprise a second electrical connector. In still another step, the second electrical connector of the interface member may be automatically coupled to the first electrical connector of the launch platform.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the disclosure will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.</p>
