<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to gas cooking appliances, and, more particularly, to an air-inlet assembly for a cooking appliance and cooking appliances incorporating such air inlet assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gas fired stoves, ovens, and ranges typically include one or more gas heating units coupled to a main gas line to the appliance and providing fuel to the heating units, sometimes referred to as burners. In a domestic range, a gas line is connected to a distribution manifold within the appliance to direct gas to a plurality of surface burners on a cooktop or to baking elements within an oven cavity. Operation of the surface burners is usually accomplished with burner control knobs located on the front wall of the appliance in front of the cooktop or on the cooktop surface. Below each knob is a circular orifice, which allows air to pass down into the burner box of the cooktop. When a control knob is actuated, fuel is supplied to associated burners and an ignition module creates a spark to ignite the gas and produce a flame.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic, touch-sensitive control interfaces are becoming increasingly popular in modern ranges and cooktops to control a variety of cooking elements. By implementing electronic touch controls on a gas cooktop, the opening beneath the control knobs is eliminated as a source of air for the burner box.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects of the present invention provide an air inlet system for a gas cooking apparatus having a cooktop, at least one gas surface burner and a burner box around the gas burner, covered by the cooktop. The cooktop has at least one peripheral vent cut configured to vent outside air into the burner box to provide air for the gas burner. The system further includes a vent trim attached to the cooktop and covering the vent cut. The vent trim has a surface with openings above a top surface of the cooktop. The openings are configured to allow outside air to enter the vent cut through the vent trim.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet other aspects, the present invention provides an air inlet system for a gas cooking apparatus having a cooktop, at least one gas surface burner and a burner box around the gas burner, covered by the cooktop. The cooktop also has at least one peripheral vent cut configured to vent outside air into the burner box to provide air for the gas burner. The system also includes an elongate cover member attached to the cooktop and covering the vent cut. The cover member has a surface with openings configured to allow outside air to enter the vent cut through the cover member. The cover member also includes a raised surface isolating the openings from spills on the cooktop.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In still other aspects, the present invention provides a gas cooking apparatus having a cooktop, at least one gas surface burner and a burner box around the gas burner, covered by the cooktop. The cooktop has at least one peripheral vent cut configured to vent outside air into the burner box to provide air for the gas burner. The gas cooking apparatus also includes a vent trim attached to the cooktop and covering the vent cut. The vent trim has a surface with openings above a top surface of the cooktop. The openings are configured to allow outside air to enter the vent cut through the vent trim.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet other aspects, the present invention provides a gas cooking apparatus that includes a cooktop, at least one gas surface burner and a burner box around the gas burner, covered by the cooktop The cooktop also has at least one peripheral vent cut configured to vent outside air into the burner box to provide air for the gas burner.

The cover member also has a raised surface isolating the openings from spills on the cooktop.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It will be appreciated that configurations of the present invention can be utilized to direct air to a burner box to supply sufficient air to ignite a gas supply and produce a flame while preventing food or liquid from entering the burner box. As a result, configurations of the present invention improve the performance of a gas unit as well as the ability to clean the cooktop in a cost effective and time-saving manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term cooktop as used herein refers to a surface cooking system that includes at least one gas surface burner. A cooktop system can be a stand-alone unit that is mounted, for example, on a kitchen countertop. A cooktop system also can be integrated with an oven to form a range. Such cooktops and ranges are commercially available from the General Electric Company.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Gas cooktop systems typically have a generally planar glass-ceramic or porcelain cooking surface with heating units at the cooking surface. Each surface burner may be operable at various power levels. Prior to operation, a user typically positions a pot or pan containing food on the cooking surface over a burner to be operated and selects, via a user interface, a desired power setting for the burner. The cooktop system responds by supplying gas to the selected heating element in accordance with the user selected power setting.</p>
