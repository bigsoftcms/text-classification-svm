<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention are related to injector assemblies, and more particularly, to injector assemblies having multiple manifolds for selective delivery of propellants.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rocket engines provide thrust to a rocket, spacecraft, or other devices or vehicles by burning a mixture of a fuel, such as kerosene, methane, or hydrogen to list non-limiting examples, and an oxidizer, such as oxygen to list a non-limiting example, in a combustion chamber. The fuel and oxidizer are delivered to the combustion chamber by an injector assembly and are then atomized, vaporized, mixed, and combusted in the combustion chamber. The fuel and oxidizer are commonly referred to as propellants. The rocket engine may be throttled up to provide more thrust or throttled down to provide less thrust by increasing or decreasing the amount of propellants provided to the combustion chamber of the rocket engine. The individual propellants are often stored and initially delivered as liquids. Typically, injector assemblies of rocket engines and other applications are configured to operate with only one type of fuel, thus limiting the number of refueling possibilities that may further limit the use of the injector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a typical coaxial element injector assembly <b>10</b>, the injector assembly comprises a manifold <b>12</b> for the oxidizer and a manifold <b>14</b> for the fuel, wherein each manifold may have a valve upstream of the manifold to control the amount of propellants provided to each manifold through the oxidizer inlet <b>12</b>A and the fuel inlet <b>14</b>A. The propellants flow from the manifold into the combustion chamber <b>16</b> through several individual injector elements <b>18</b> that comprise both an oxidizer flow passage and a fuel flow passage. The oxidizer flow passage and the fuel flow passage may define a coaxial arrangement to provide mixing of the oxidizer and fuel. An injector assembly may include only one injector element or up to several hundred injector elements in a large assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to minimize the likelihood of poor performance or poor combustion stability, a typical injector element will have a pressure drop of 10% to 20% of the combustion chamber pressure during normal operation. Problems with injector assemblies often arise when the rocket engine is throttled up or down a relatively large amount which changes the pressure drop across the injector elements. This change in pressure drop is created by the change in flow through the injector elements, and the change in pressure is proportional to the square of the relative amount of propellant flow through the injector elements. For example, if the flow of the propellant is decreased to one half (&#xbd;) of the original flow, the pressure drop is reduced by one fourth (&#xbc;) of the original pressure drop. Conversely, if the flow of the propellant is increased by three times, the pressure drop is increased by nine times.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the pressure drop across the injector element is too low, atomization, vaporization, and mixing will be insufficient, thus leading to poor performance of the rocket engine. A low pressure drop across the injector element may also lead to combustion instability that may further lead to sudden failure of the rocket engine. If the pressure drop across the injector element is too high, an inordinate amount of energy is required to pump the propellant to the high pressure required to introduce flow into the injector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for an injector assembly that maintains sufficient pressure drop when the injector is throttled a relatively large amount. In addition, the needed injector assembly would maintain good performance and protect from feed system coupled combustion instabilities without sacrificing the range of throttling available in conventional injector assemblies or exposing moving surfaces and dynamic seals to hot and/or corrosive reaction products.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention address the needs and achieve other advantages by providing an injector assembly that comprises at least two oxidizer manifolds with an oxidizer valve, such as an integral valve, to selectively provide an oxidizer to one or more of the oxidizer manifolds. The oxidizer element is in fluid communication with each of the oxidizer manifolds, whereby the oxidizer element defines openings through the oxidizer element wall that open into each oxidizer manifold. The injector assembly is throttled by selectively adjusting the amount of oxidizer provided to each oxidizer manifold by actuating the oxidizer valve. Additionally or alternatively, embodiments of the present invention provide an injector assembly that comprises at least two fuel manifolds with a fuel valve, such as an integral valve, to selectively provide fuel to one or more of the fuel manifolds. By providing multiple manifolds for delivery of the oxidizer and/or fuel, which ultimately affects the injector discharge coefficient, the injector assembly is able to achieve large changes in oxidizer and fuel flow without the undesirable large changes in pressure drop across the respective side of the injector. Moreover, the injector assembly is advantageously configured to avoid exposing moving surfaces and dynamic seals to hot and/or corrosive reaction products.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An injector assembly of one embodiment of the present invention for the delivery of propellants to a combustion chamber comprises an oxidizer element upstream of the combustion chamber and at least two oxidizer manifolds in fluid communication with the oxidizer element opposite the combustion chamber. Similarly the injector assembly comprises a fuel element upstream of the combustion chamber and at least one fuel manifold in fluid communication with the fuel element opposite the combustion chamber. An oxidizer valve is also included to selectively provide an oxidizer to one or more of the oxidizer manifolds. Therefore, the injector assembly may be throttled by selectively providing an oxidizer to one or more oxidizer manifolds and thus enabling change in the flow of the oxidizer through the oxidizer element without effecting an undesirable large change in pressure drop across the oxidizer element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An additional embodiment of the present invention includes an injector assembly with at least two fuel manifolds to similarly enable changes in flow of the fuel without effecting an undesirable change in pressure drop across the fuel element. Further embodiments of the present invention include an oxidizer valve and/or a fuel valve that comprises an integral valve, oxidizer elements and fuel elements that are coaxial to one another, oxidizer elements and/or fuel elements that are swirl injectors, and oxidizer elements and/or fuel elements that have varying cross-sectional areas along the axial length of the oxidizer element. To prevent backflow into oxidizer manifolds and/or fuel manifolds that selectively are not providing an oxidizer or fuel, respectively, still further embodiments of the present invention include a lift-off seal that selectively engages the oxidizer valve and/or fuel valve to selectively allow a nominal amount of an oxidizer or fuel to bleed into each of the oxidizer manifolds and/or fuel manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other aspects of the present invention also provide methods for operating an injector assembly without creating a significant change in pressure drop across the injector element. An oxidizer is delivered to two or more oxidizer manifolds and then provided to the combustion chamber through an oxidizer element. The amount of oxidizer delivered to the oxidizer manifolds is controlled by selectively actuating an oxidizer valve, such as an integral valve. Fuel is delivered to a fuel manifold and then provided to the combustion chamber through a fuel element to allow mixing of the oxidizer and fuel. The oxidizer and/or fuel are swirled in some embodiments of the present invention to facilitate mixing of the oxidizer and fuel. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may either provide a filler fluid (such as a vaporized form of the nominally liquid oxidizer) into at least one oxidizer manifold to which an oxidizer is selectively not delivered or move a lift-off seal proximate to the oxidizer valve to allow an oxidizer to bleed into at least one oxidizer manifold to which an oxidizer is selectively not delivered. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention provide apparatuses and methods for reducing or eliminating the undesirable change in pressure drop across an injector element previously associated with throttling of the injector assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">At least three embodiments of the present invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to only the embodiments described and shown. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, injector assemblies of various embodiments of the present invention are illustrated, wherein the injector assemblies are shown in rocket engines, for use with missiles and spacecraft, to list two non-limiting examples. Further embodiments of the present invention are used in other applications in which flow energy is converted into other forms of energy such as mechanical energy or electrical energy. A non-limiting example of an injector assembly of the present invention includes an injector assembly for a land-based gas turbine. Still further embodiments of the present invention use the injector assemblies to create a product gas, such as in the oil and chemical industries in which waste materials are mixed with other constituents to create a desired byproduct, to describe one non-limiting example. Referring again to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the rocket engines provide thrust by combusting a mixture of oxidizer and fuel. The oxidizer used by the rocket engines of the various embodiments of the present invention may be any oxidizer delivered in any state, such as liquid oxygen to name on non-limiting example. Similarly, the fuel used by the rocket engines of the various embodiments of the present invention may be any fuel delivered in any state, such as hydrogen, methane, kerosene, or the like to list non-limiting examples of fuels. The rocket engines of the various embodiments of the present invention are capable of operating with various oxidizers and fuels, such that the rocket engine is not limited to using only one specific oxidizer or fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The rocket engine <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises an oxidizer valve <b>32</b> which controls delivery of the oxidizer, preferably from a stored container, into the two or more oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> of the rocket engine. The oxidizer valve <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is servo controlled by a servo motor (not shown) that is controlled by either a processing element, such as a processor or other computing device, or by an operator, either directly or indirectly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the oxidizer valve <b>32</b> defines a generally circular cross-section with a passage <b>33</b> therethrough, in which the passage is sized to allow an oxidizer to pass to all of the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>; however, further embodiments of the present invention may have alternatively shaped or sized valves and/or provide multiple valves to allow sufficient passage of an oxidizer to the oxidizer manifolds. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the oxidizer valve <b>32</b> is illustrated in a position that allows an oxidizer to substantially pass only to the first oxidizer manifold <b>34</b>; however, the oxidizer valve may also be positioned to allow an oxidizer to pass to both the first oxidizer manifold <b>34</b> and second oxidizer manifold <b>36</b> or to pass to the first, second, and third oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>. Still further embodiments of the present invention include an oxidizer valve that allows passage of the oxidizer to only the third oxidizer manifold or to only the second and third oxidizer manifolds. The oxidizer valve <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> defines an integral valve such that the valve opens or closes an oxidizer manifold inlet substantially completely without maintaining a partially opened position for an oxidizer manifold. Further embodiments of the present invention include oxidizer valves that allow partial passage of an oxidizer, such as by rotating the passage to open only partially to the oxidizer manifold inlet, such as half open to allow approximately 50% of the oxidizer to pass relative to a fully open inlet. Still further embodiments of the present invention comprise an injector assembly comprising an integral valve and a variable valve, such as upstream of the integral valve, to control the flow of oxidizer. Additional embodiments of the present invention provide multiple oxidizer valves to control the delivery of oxidizer to the oxidizer manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the rocket engine <b>30</b> comprises three oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>; however, further embodiments of the present invention may comprise additional oxidizer manifolds based upon performance requirements. The oxidizer element <b>40</b> of the rocket engine <b>30</b> defines an axial length sufficient to be in fluid communication with all of the oxidizer manifolds. The oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are in fluid communication with the oxidizer element <b>40</b> and are configured to deliver an oxidizer to the oxidizer element. It should also be noted that rocket engines of various embodiments of the present invention may include one or more, such as several hundred, oxidizer elements and may include one or more oxidizer valves. Some embodiments of the present invention comprising multiple oxidizer valves preferably control the oxidizer valves to operate synchronously; however, further embodiments control the oxidizer valves independently.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> defines an axial length sufficient to be in fluid communication with the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>. The oxidizer element <b>40</b> comprises a top opening <b>42</b> through which an oxidizer from the third oxidizer manifold <b>38</b> enters the oxidizer element. The top opening <b>42</b> is defined in the axial end of the oxidizer element <b>40</b> and defines a central axis that is substantially coaxial with the axis of the oxidizer element. Further embodiments of the rocket engine define two or more top openings and/or side openings through which an oxidizer from an oxidizer manifold enters. The oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes a first set of openings <b>44</b>, such as four openings equally spaced in a circumferential direction, that are defined along the perimeter of the oxidizer element at an axial location proximate the first oxidizer manifold <b>34</b> such that an oxidizer from the first oxidizer manifold enters the oxidizer element through the first set of openings. Similarly, the oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes a second set of openings <b>46</b> that are defined along the perimeter of the oxidizer element at an axial location proximate to the second oxidizer manifold <b>36</b> such that an oxidizer from the second oxidizer manifold enters the oxidizer element through the second set of openings. Further embodiments of the rocket engine define oxidizer elements having sets of openings in fluid communication with respective oxidizer manifolds, wherein the sets of openings define any number of openings, including only one opening, depending upon the size and positioning of the openings comprising a set of openings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a post injector having at least one opening to one or more of the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> such that the axis of the opening defines an axis that is generally radial relative to the axis of the oxidizer element. Therefore, the oxidizer that enters the oxidizer element <b>40</b> from the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> will flow axially through the oxidizer element in a generally steady flow thus creating an oxidizer-fuel interface proximate to the axial end of the oxidizer element closest to the combustion chamber <b>48</b>, whereby the interface causes the oxidizer and fuel to mix a sufficient amount for combustion purposes. Further embodiments of the rocket engine, such as the rocket engine <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, provide an oxidizer element <b>240</b> that comprises a post injector that further defines a swirl injector having at least one opening to one or more of the oxidizer manifolds <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b>, wherein the opening defines an axis that is generally tangential relative to the axis of the oxidizer element. The generally tangential orientation of the set of openings <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> creates a swirl of the oxidizer as the oxidizer flows in a generally axial direction which atomizes the oxidizer prior to the oxidizer mixing with the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to the oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to reduce or eliminate backflow through the oxidizer element, the oxidizer element defines a variable cross-sectional area along the axial length of the oxidizer element. The oxidizer element <b>40</b> defines a step <b>50</b> generally between the first oxidizer manifold <b>34</b> and the second oxidizer manifold <b>36</b> to reduce the possibility of backflow in a direction away from the combustion chamber <b>48</b>. Similarly the flange around the top opening <b>42</b> at the axial end of the oxidizer element <b>40</b> similarly provides a step to reduce the possibility of backflow. Therefore, the oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> defines a cross-sectional area that generally increases as the oxidizer element extends axially from the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> to the combustion chamber <b>48</b>. Further embodiments of the present invention provide an oxidizer element that defines a cross-sectional area that alternatively increases and decreases as the oxidizer element extends axially from the oxidizer manifolds to the combustion chamber or that define a generally consistent cross-sectional area along the entire axial length of the oxidizer element.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the rocket engine <b>30</b> also comprises a fuel manifold <b>52</b> into which a fuel is delivered. The fuel manifold <b>52</b> is in fluid communication with a fuel element <b>54</b> and is configured to deliver fuel to the fuel element. The combination of the oxidizer element <b>40</b> and the fuel element <b>54</b> defines the injector element of the rocket engine <b>30</b>. A fuel valve (not shown) is provided for controlling the delivery of fuel to the fuel manifold <b>52</b>. The injector assembly of the rocket engine <b>30</b> is defined by the oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>, the fuel manifold <b>52</b>, the oxidizer valve <b>32</b>, the fuel valve, and the injector element. Further embodiments of the present invention, such as the rocket engine <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, comprise two or more fuel manifolds <b>152</b>, <b>153</b>, and <b>156</b> and a fuel valve <b>158</b> that defines a passage <b>160</b> to provide fuel to the fuel element <b>154</b> in a similar fashion as the oxidizer valve <b>32</b> of the rocket engine <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> delivers an oxidizer to the oxidizer element <b>40</b>. The fuel valve <b>158</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> defines an integral valve such that the valve opens or closes a fuel manifold inlet substantially completely without maintaining a partially opened position for a fuel manifold. Further embodiments of the rocket engine include fuel valves that allow partial passage of fuel, such as by rotating the passage to open only partially to the fuel manifold inlet, such as half open to allow approximately 50% of the fuel to pass relative to a fully open inlet. Still further embodiments of the present invention comprise an injector assembly comprising an integral valve and a variable valve, such as upstream of the integral valve, to control the flow of fuel. Additional embodiments of the present invention provide multiple fuel valves to control the delivery of fuel to the fuel manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning now to the fuel element <b>54</b> of the rocket engine <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fuel element, which like the oxidizer element <b>40</b> is upstream of the combustion chamber and downstream of the respective manifold, defines a set of openings <b>55</b>, such as four openings equally spaced in a circumferential direction, that are defined along the perimeter of the fuel element at an axial location proximate the fuel manifold <b>52</b> such that fuel from the fuel manifold enters the fuel element through the set of openings, similar to the sets of openings of the oxidizer element <b>40</b>. The fuel element <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a swirl injector; however, further embodiments of the rocket engine of the present invention include fuel elements that comprise a shear coaxial injector annulus that does not swirl the fuel. The fuel element <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an annulus that defines a central axis that is substantially coaxial with the axis of the oxidizer element <b>40</b>, such that the fuel element is annular and surrounds the oxidizer element. Conversely, the fuel element <b>154</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> defines a shape substantially similar to the oxidizer element <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such that the oxidizer element <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is annular and surrounds the fuel element. Still further embodiments of the present invention define the oxidizer element and fuel element in alternative configurations to mix the oxidizer and fuel. The mixture of oxidizer and fuel that is delivered to the combustion chamber is ignited to generate combustion gases for the generation of thrust. Further embodiments of the present invention deliver a mixture of oxidizer and fuel to generate combustion gases for non-thrust purposes, such as energy conversion purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fuel valves, fuel manifolds, and fuel elements of the rocket engines of the illustrated embodiments are configured to deliver a variety of fuels to the combustion chamber. For example, the rocket engine <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may generate thrust in a first operational cycle using a first fuel, such as hydrogen, and then in an alternative second operational cycle using a second fuel, such as methane, and may further generate thrust in a third operational cycle using a third fuel, such as kerosene, to list non-limiting examples of alternative fuels. Therefore, the rocket engines of some embodiments of the present invention are not limited to only one specific type of fuel to allow more flexibility when refueling the rocket engine. The amount of oxidizer and fuel provided to the combustion chamber can also be controlled to maintain a substantially consistent mixture ratio of fuel and oxidizer at all power levels of the rocket engine for at least one of the first fuel or the second fuel. The amount of an oxidizer delivered to the oxidizer element is dependent upon the reaction chemistry of the fuel and oxidizer being delivered to the injector element, and processing circuitry is provided in some embodiments of the present invention to automatically control the oxidizer valve relative to the fuel valve, or vice versa, to provide a substantially consistent mixture ratio of fuel and oxidizer at the interface of the fuel and oxidizer for all power levels of the rocket engine. For example, relatively less oxidizer is provided to the oxidizer valve when used in combination with methane, whereas relatively more oxidizer is provided in combination with hydrogen at corresponding nominal operational conditions. Therefore, some embodiments of the present invention control the mixture ratio of fuel and oxidizer to improve the injector assembly performance for varying propellant combinations and operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the oxidizer valve <b>32</b> is positioned as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the second oxidizer manifold <b>36</b> and third oxidizer manifold <b>38</b> are not delivered an oxidizer through the passage <b>33</b>. However, during operation of the rocket engine, a lack of an oxidizer entering the respective manifold may give rise to an undesirable pressure differential that could create backflow into the manifold. Therefore, the rocket engine <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a lift-off seal <b>70</b> that selectively engages the oxidizer valve to selectively allow an oxidizer to bleed into the second oxidizer manifold <b>36</b> and the third oxidizer manifold <b>38</b> to reduce or eliminate the undesirable pressure differential. The material separating the second and third oxidizer manifolds <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides a nominal gap at the interface with the oxidizer valve <b>32</b> to allow the bled oxidizer to pass to both the second and third oxidizer manifolds. The lift-off seal <b>70</b> comprises a ring of any material suitable for selectively sealing the valve, and the lift-off seal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is linearly actuated using a bellow device; however, further embodiments of the present invention may include lift-off seals defining alternative shapes or materials and are actuated by alternative devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a filler fluid source <b>274</b> is provided to reduce or eliminate the undesirable pressure differential otherwise created when one or more of the oxidizer manifolds are not delivered an oxidizer. The filler fluid source <b>274</b> selectively fills an oxidizer manifold, such as the second oxidizer manifold <b>236</b> and the third oxidizer manifold <b>238</b> with a filler fluid which may comprise a gas, liquid, or combination thereof, may further comprise a combustible or non-combustible fluid, and may also comprise a continuous flow of filler fluid or a stagnant supply of filler fluid. One non-limiting example of a filler fluid is a vaporized oxidizer provided in a continuous flow sufficient to prevent backflow. The filler fluid advantageously prevents backflow from the oxidizer element into the respective oxidizer manifold. The filler fluid source <b>274</b> preferably includes a servo controlled valve <b>276</b> to selectively fill the oxidizer manifolds with the filler fluid. The position of the servo controlled valve <b>276</b> of the filler fluid source <b>274</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is correlated to the position of the oxidizer valve <b>232</b> such that when the oxidizer valve closes the passage <b>233</b> to an oxidizer manifold, the servo controlled valve opens the passage to the respective oxidizer manifold to allow the filler fluid to fill the oxidizer manifold with a continuous flow of filler fluid or a stagnant supply of filler fluid. If a stagnant supply of filler fluid is provided, the oxidizer manifold retains a substantial portion the filler fluid until the oxidizer valve reopens the passage <b>233</b> to the respective oxidizer manifold, at which time the oxidizer expels the filler fluid through the oxidizer element <b>240</b> and into the combustion chamber. Still further embodiments of the present invention provide alternative and/or additional methods and devices for reducing or eliminating backflow into manifolds that are not receiving an oxidizer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention also provide methods of operating a rocket engine to allow throttling of the rocket engine with reduced the change in pressure drop across the oxidizer element and/or fuel element. One method of the present invention comprises delivering an oxidizer to two or more oxidizer manifolds and delivering a fuel to one or more fuel manifolds. As discussed above, the amounts of oxidizer and fuel delivered depend upon the type of fuel delivered to thereby maintain a substantially consistent mixture ratio of fuel and oxidizer at all power levels of the rocket engine. The oxidizer valve is selectively actuated to control delivery of the oxidizer into the oxidizer manifolds, through the oxidizer element, and into the combustion chamber. Similarly, the fuel valve is selectively actuated to control delivery of the fuel into the fuel manifold, through the fuel element, and into the combustion chamber to allow the oxidizer to mix with the fuel. The oxidizer and/or the fuel may be swirled by the oxidizer element or the fuel element, respectively, prior to combining the oxidizer and fuel. The swirling of the oxidizer and/or fuel substantially atomizes the oxidizer or fuel to enable further mixing of the oxidizer and fuel. The mixture of oxidizer and fuel is then combusted to generate the thrust of the rocket engine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition to providing the multiple oxidizer manifolds and/or fuel manifolds, embodiments of the present invention provide further methods for reducing or eliminating the change in pressure drop across the oxidizer element and/or fuel element during throttling of the rocket engine. When an oxidizer valve is positioned to prevent an oxidizer from entering at least one oxidizer manifold, the oxidizer manifold is selectively filled with filler fluid by actuating a servo controlled valve. An alternative method comprises moving at least one lift-off seal proximate the oxidizer valve and/or fuel valve when an oxidizer valve or fuel valve is positioned to prevent an oxidizer or fuel from entering an oxidizer manifold or fuel manifold to thereby allow a nominal amount of an oxidizer or fuel to bleed into the oxidizer manifold or fuel manifold, respectively.</p>
