<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This catalyst system simultaneously removes ammonia and enhances net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion by placing an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst formulation downstream of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. By doing so, the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst adsorbs the ammonia from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap generated during the rich pulses. The stored ammonia then reacts with the NO<sub>x </sub>emitted from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap&#x2014;enhancing the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion rate significantly, while depleting the stored ammonia. By combining the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap with the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst, the system allows for the reduction or elimination of NH<sub>3 </sub>and NO<sub>x </sub>slip, reduction in NO<sub>x </sub>spikes and thus an improved net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion during lean and rich operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to a catalyst system to facilitate the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ammonia from an exhaust gas. More particularly, the catalyst system of this invention includes a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap in combination with an ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR) catalyst, which stores the ammonia formed in the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap during rich air/fuel operation and then reacts the stored ammonia with nitrogen oxides to improve NO<sub>x </sub>conversion to nitrogen when the engine is operated under lean air/fuel ratios. In an alternate embodiment, a three-way catalyst is designed to produce desirable NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions at stoichiometric conditions and thus reduce NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Catalysts have long been used in the exhaust systems of automotive vehicles to convert carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) produced during engine operation into non-polluting gases such as carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. As a result of increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions standards for car and truck applications, it is preferable to operate an engine under lean conditions to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and lower CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. Lean conditions have air/fuel ratios greater than the stoichiometric ratio (an air/fuel ratio of 14.6), typically air/fuel ratios greater than 15. While lean operation improves fuel economy, operating under lean conditions increases the difficulty in treating some polluting gases, especially NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding NO<sub>x </sub>reduction for diesel and lean burn gasoline engines in particular, lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (trap) technologies have been widely used to reduce exhaust gas NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. Lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers operate in a cyclic fashion of lean and rich durations. The lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap functions by adsorbing NO<sub>x </sub>when the engine is running under lean conditions&#x2014;until the NO<sub>x </sub>trap reaches the effective storage limit&#x2014;followed by NO<sub>x </sub>reduction when the engine is running under rich conditions. Alternatively, NO<sub>x </sub>reduction can proceed by simply injecting into the exhaust a sufficient amount of reductant that is independent of the engine operation. During this rich cycle, a short rich pulse of reductants, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrocarbons reduces the NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbed by the trap during the lean cycle. The reduction caused during the rich cycle purges the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber, and the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber is then immediately available for the next lean NO<sub>x </sub>storage/rich NO<sub>x </sub>reduction cycle. In general, poor NO<sub>x </sub>reduction is observed if the air excess ratio &#x3bb; is above 1. NO<sub>x </sub>reduction generally increases over lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers as the &#x3bb; ratio is decreased lower than 1. This air excess or lambda ratio is defined as the actual air/fuel ratio divided by the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of the fuel used. The use of lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (trap) technology, and in particular the rich pulse of reductants, can cause the &#x3bb; ratio to reach well below 1.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Lean NO<sub>x </sub>traps, however, often have the problem of low NO<sub>x </sub>conversion; that is, a high percentage of the NO<sub>x </sub>slips through the trap as NO<sub>x</sub>. NO<sub>x </sub>slip can occur either during the lean portion of the cycle or during the rich portion. The lean NO<sub>x </sub>slip is often called &#x201c;NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough&#x201d;. It occurs during extended lean operation and is related to saturation of the NO<sub>x </sub>trap capacity. The rich NO<sub>x </sub>slip is often called a &#x201c;NO<sub>x </sub>spike&#x201d;. It occurs during the short period in which the NO<sub>x </sub>trap transitions from lean to rich and is related to the release of stored NO<sub>x </sub>without reduction. Test results depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>have shown that during this lean-rich transition, NO<sub>x </sub>spikes, the large peaks of unreacted NO<sub>x</sub>, accounts for approximately 73% of the total NO<sub>x </sub>emitted during the operation of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough accounts for the remaining 27% of the NO<sub>x </sub>emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An additional problem with lean NO<sub>x </sub>traps arises as a result of the generation of ammonia by the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, ammonia is emitted into the atmosphere during rich pulses of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. In laboratory reactor experiments, ammonia spikes as high as 600 ppm have been observed under typical lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber operation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>). While ammonia is currently not regulated, ammonia emissions are being closely monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and, therefore, reduction efforts must be underway. Ammonia is created when hydrogen or hydrogen bound to hydrocarbons reacts with NO<sub>x </sub>over a precious metal, such as platinum. The potential for ammonia generation increases for a precious metal catalyst (such as a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap) as the &#x3bb; ratio is decreased, as the duration of the rich pulse increases, and the temperature is decreased. There is thus an optimum lambda and rich pulse duration where the maximum NO<sub>x </sub>reduction is observed without producing ammonia. Attempts to enhance conversion of NO<sub>x </sub>by decreasing the &#x3bb; ratio of the rich pulse duration leads to significant production of ammonia and thus results in high gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion (NO<sub>x</sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>+NH<sub>3</sub>), but much lower net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion (NO<sub>x</sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to nitrogen, a desirable non-polluting gas, and the undesirable NH<sub>3 </sub>described above, N<sub>2</sub>O is another NO<sub>x </sub>reduction products. Like NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O is generated over NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers and emitted into the atmosphere during rich pulses. The gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is the percent of NO<sub>x </sub>that is reduced to N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub><b>0</b> and NH<sub>3</sub>. The net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is the percent of NO<sub>x </sub>that is reduced to nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, only. Accordingly, the gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is equal to the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion if nitrogen is the only reaction product. However, the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is almost always lower than the gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion. Accordingly, a high gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion does not completely correlate with the high portion of NO<sub>x </sub>that is reduced to nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The NO<sub>x </sub>conversion problem is magnified for diesel vehicles, which require more than a 90% NO<sub>x </sub>conversion rate under the 2007 U.S. Tier II BIN 5 emissions standards at temperatures as low as 200&#xb0; C. While high NO<sub>x </sub>activity is possible at 200&#xb0; C., it requires extreme measures such as shortening the lean time, lengthening the rich purge time, and invoking very rich air/fuel ratios. All three of these measures, however, result in the increased formation of NH<sub>3 </sub>or ammonia. Accordingly, while it may be possible to achieve 90+% gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion at 200&#xb0; C., to date there has not been a viable solution to achieve 90+% net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a need exists for a catalyst system that eliminates NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough during the lean operation as well has the NO<sub>x </sub>spikes during the lean-rich transition period. There is also a need for a catalyst system that is capable of improving net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion. Finally, there is a need for a catalyst system capable of reducing ammonia emissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention provides a solution for all of the above problems and, in particular, reduces or eliminates ammonia emissions and improves the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion of the catalyst system. These problems are solved by simultaneously removing ammonia and enhancing NO<sub>x </sub>conversion with the use of an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst placed downstream of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber catalyst, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system serves to adsorb the ammonia emissions from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber catalyst generated during the rich pulses. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ammonia emissions produced by the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber is stored and effectively controlled by the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst rather than being emitted. This reservoir of adsorbed ammonia then reacts directly with the NO<sub>x </sub>emitted from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the overall net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is enhanced from 55% to 80%, while depleting the stored ammonia, as a function of the SCR reaction: NH<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>x</sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>. The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst is then replenished with ammonia by subsequent rich pulses over the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During the lean cycle for this lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber+NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR system, the NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber is reduced continuously as it passes over the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR until the reservoir of ammonia is depleted. In addition, during the rich cycle, large spikes of unreacted NO<sub>x </sub>are created. The downstream NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst thus serves to dampen these large NO<sub>x </sub>spikes by reacting the unreacted NO<sub>x </sub>with the reservoir of stored ammonia emitted from the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. In general, the combination of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber+NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system allows for the reduction, or elimination, of ammonia emissions and NO<sub>x </sub>slip, i.e., reduction of NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough and NO<sub>x </sub>spikes and, therefore, improved net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion during lean and rich operation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, under this invention, urea and/or ammonia does not need to be injected into the exhaust system to effectuate the reaction between NO<sub>x </sub>and ammonia. Rather, the ammonia is automatically generated from the NO<sub>x </sub>present in the exhaust gas as it passes over the precious metal lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber during the rich pulses. The generated ammonia is then stored on the downstream NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst, to react with the unreacted NO<sub>x</sub>, and thereby convert the unreacted NO<sub>x </sub>to nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst thus serves to adsorb the ammonia from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber catalyst generated during the rich pulses. Under this system, the ammonia is stored and effectively controlled rather than being emitted. This reservoir of adsorbed ammonia then reacts directly with any NO<sub>x </sub>emitted from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. As a result, the overall net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is enhanced from 55% to 80%, while the overall gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is enhanced from 68% to 82%, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one alternative embodiment of this invention, the catalyst system can be optimized and NO<sub>x </sub>reduction increased by vertically slicing the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst substrates to create separate catalyst zones, such that the catalytic converter shell or can would have alternating sections of lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalysts, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b><i>c</i>. Under this embodiment, both technologies, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap formulation and the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR formulation, can be incorporated into a single substrate and/or a single converter can rather than placing the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst downstream of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber as two separate and distinct catalyst substrates.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this invention, net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is improved and ammonia emissions reduced through the use of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system which operate together to produce and store ammonia and reduce NO<sub>x </sub>to nitrogen. In so doing, the catalyst system of the present invention solves three problems of lean NO<sub>x </sub>traps; namely, reducing NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough, NO<sub>x </sub>spikes and ammonia emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy standards, it is preferable to operate an automotive engine under lean conditions. However, while there is improvement in fuel economy, operating under lean conditions has increased the difficulty in reducing NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. As an example, for a traditional three-way catalyst, if the air/fuel ratio is lean even by a small amount, NO<sub>x </sub>conversion drops to low levels. With traditional three-way catalysts, the air/fuel ratio must be controlled carefully at stoichiometric conditions to maximize reduction of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Throughout this specification, NO<sub>x </sub>refers to nitrogen oxides, which include nitrogen monoxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO<sub>2</sub>. Further, lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber and lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap are used interchangeably throughout this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To achieve NO<sub>x </sub>reduction, under lean operating conditions, one option is the inclusion of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. While the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap is generally effective in NO<sub>x </sub>reduction, lean NO<sub>x </sub>traps are known to have the problems referred to as &#x201c;NO<sub>x </sub>slip&#x201d; which includes breakthrough of NO<sub>x </sub>during the extended lean operation of the NO<sub>x </sub>trap and also NO<sub>x </sub>spikes generated during the transition from the lean to the rich cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">NO<sub>x </sub>spikes, or NO<sub>x </sub>emissions during the lean-rich transition, are believed to occur due to the exothermic heat generated from the oxidation of reductants, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and hydrogen, by the oxygen released from the oxygen storage material&#x2014;the temperature rise can be as high as 80-100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The problem of NO<sub>x </sub>spikes is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, and the problem of insufficient net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>depicts laboratory reactor data of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber system operating in an 85 second lean and 5 second rich cyclic pattern. The plot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows the nitrogen species concentration as a function of time. The laboratory reactor data depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>resulted from a catalyst having an engine swept volume (ESV) of 100%. Additionally, the reactor used to obtain the results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>was at a temperature of 300&#xb0; C. To begin the cycle, 500 ppm of nitrogen oxide was fed into the reactor where much of it was stored during the 85 second lean duration. During the 5 second rich duration, nitrogen oxide was reduced; however, a significant amount of ammonia was formed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the data shows ammonia spikes as high as 600 ppm under typical lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber operation. Conversion, however, is generally improved as the &#x3bb; ratio is decreased during the rich pulse. Decreasing the &#x3bb; ratio also leads to significant production of ammonia and thus results in high gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion (NO<sub>x </sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>+NH<sub>3</sub>), but much lower net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion (NO<sub>x</sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion to nitrogen for this lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber system was only 55%.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Under the catalyst system of this invention, ammonia is reduced and the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion improved simultaneously by placing an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst formulation downstream of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber catalyst, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of the catalyst system of this invention, which is capable of simultaneously eliminating ammonia emissions and improving net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, NO<sub>x </sub>produced during engine operation is stored by the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber during the lean cycle. Following the lean cycle, during the rich cycle of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber, NO<sub>x </sub>is reduced and ammonia generated. The lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber stores much of the NO<sub>x </sub>during the lean operation and then reduces NO<sub>x </sub>during rich pulses of the reductants. During the same rich pulses, significant amounts of ammonia are generated, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber emits NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O. These same gases then pass through the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR, where NH<sub>3 </sub>is stored. Accordingly, the addition of the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst downstream allows for the adsorption of NH<sub>3 </sub>and subsequent reaction with any NO<sub>x </sub>that slips through the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber, which thus improves the overall net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion (NH<sub>3</sub>+NO&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the catalyst system of this invention results in a significant net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion improvement, the elimination of ammonia emissions, and the production of non-polluting gases nitrogen and N<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that for diesel applications, lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers must operate at lower temperatures compared to gasoline lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers since the exhaust temperatures of diesel engines are significantly lower. More ammonia is generated at 200&#xb0; C. than at 300&#xb0; C. over lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbers, and thus the catalyst system of this invention has an even greater potential for diesel applications. Likewise, the problem of NO<sub>x </sub>spikes is more critical at higher temperatures, the temperatures used for gasoline applications; and thus the catalyst system of this invention is beneficial to control the unreacted NO<sub>x </sub>spikes that result from the operation of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber at operating temperatures typical for gasoline lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber applications.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst thus serves to adsorb the ammonia produced naturally from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber catalyst generated during the rich pulses. As a result, the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst stores the ammonia, controlling it rather than allowing it to be emitted into the atmosphere. This reservoir of adsorbed NH<sub>3 </sub>in the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst reacts directly with the NO<sub>x </sub>emitted from the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (trap).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In general, this invention works to clean NO<sub>x </sub>emissions&#x2014;and thus has applicability for stationary sources as well as for moving vehicles. This invention may be used to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>emissions for nitric acid plants, or any other stationary source that requires the reduction of NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. This invention is nonetheless particularly directed for use with gasoline and diesel vehicles which, unlike stationary sources, have a wide range of operating parameters, especially temperature parameters&#x2014;which cannot be precisely controlled. The present invention has the ability to store large quantities of ammonia across a broad temperature range to effectuate the reaction between ammonia and nitrogen oxides and thereby convert NO<sub>x </sub>to nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the use of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber plus NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system improves net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion from 55%, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to 80%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph displaying laboratory data obtained using the catalyst system of this invention, wherein NO<sub>x </sub>ppm are charted as a function of time. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the catalyst system of this invention completely eliminated the ammonia spikes created during the rich pulses of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. In this system, ammonia is stored on the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst where it reacts with NO<sub>x </sub>during the 85 second lean duration, which thus improves the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion from 55% to 80% with no additional fuel economy penalty. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the improved net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion can be observed by the much narrower profile&#x2014;zero ppm NO<sub>x </sub>is emitted for a significant amount of time as compared to the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of a system lacking the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR+lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber combination.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The reaction between the stored ammonia and NO<sub>x </sub>increases the overall net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion, which is enhanced from 55%&#x2014;the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>converted in prior art lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap systems&#x2014;to 80%&#x2014;as a result of the combination of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system. Moreover, in addition to improving net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion, the ammonia stored in the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst is depeted during the SCR reaction wherein ammonia and nitrogen oxide are reacted to produce nitrogen. The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst is replenished with ammonia by subsequent rich pulses over the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber that causes a portion of the NO<sub>x </sub>to react with hydrogen to form ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be noted that no urea or ammonia needs to be injected into the exhaust system to effectuate the reaction between ammonia and NO<sub>x</sub>. Rather, the ammonia is naturally generated from the NO<sub>x </sub>present in the exhaust gas as it passes over the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap during rich pulses. More specifically, ammonia is naturally created during the fuel rich cycle of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. Ammonia is naturally produced as it passes over the precious metal active component of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. Similarly, the ammonia could also be generated in a conventional precious metal based TWC located upstream of a LNT/NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For this invention, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap is optimized for ammonia generation by removing oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and thereby enhancing the rich cycle, and thus creating a greater quantity of ammonia for reaction with the NO<sub>x </sub>in the downstream NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap includes platinum as the precious metal. Platinum is the preferred precious metal because it is believed that a greater quantity of NH<sub>3 </sub>is produced over platinum than rhodium, palladium and/or a combination of the precious metals. Nonetheless, other precious metals such as palladium and rhodium, and the combination of one or more of the precious metals platinum, palladium and rhodium may also be used to generate NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap of this invention preferably includes a &#x201c;NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbing material&#x201d; or NO<sub>x </sub>storage component/material, which can be alkali and alkali earth metals such as barium, cesium, and/or rare earth metals such as cerium and/or a composite of cerium and zirconium. Although an alternative catalyst formulation that does not contain a NO<sub>x </sub>storage component but generates ammonia from NO<sub>x </sub>may also be utilized, in the most preferred embodiment, the NO<sub>x </sub>storage material should have the ability to store NO<sub>x </sub>at low temperature ranges, specifically in the range of 150&#xb0; C.-300&#xb0; C. The NH<sub>3 </sub>thermodynamic equilibrium under rich conditions is maximized during the temperature range of 150&#xb0; C.-300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, to increase the NO<sub>x </sub>storage function of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and effectuate the NO<sub>x </sub>conversion reaction, in the preferred embodiment, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap has the following characteristics: (1) the inclusion of platinum as the precious metal; (2) the ability to store NO<sub>x </sub>between 150&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C. during the lean portion of the cycle; (3) the ability to maximize the duration of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap rich cycle; (4) the ability to generate ammonia at the 150&#xb0; C.-500&#xb0; C. temperature range; (5) minimize OSC to lessen fuel penalty; and (6) lower lambda to generate more ammonia. Ammonia production is maximized at the preferred temperature range, 150&#xb0; C.-300&#xb0; C.&#x2014;which also correlates with the steady state equilibrium range for ammonia creation. It bears emphasis that other NO<sub>x </sub>storage components may be utilized, especially for stationary sources, where sulfur poisoning does not pose a threat.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Most simply, the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst may consist of any material or combination of materials that can adsorb ammonia and facilitate the NO<sub>x</sub>+NH<sub>3 </sub>to yield nitrogen. The NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst should preferably be made of a base metal catalyst on a high surface area support such as alumina, silica, titania, zeolite or a combination of these. More preferably, the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst should be made of a base metal selected from the group consisting of Cu, Fe and Ce and/or a combination of these metals, although other base metals may be used. Base metals generally are able to effectuate NO<sub>x </sub>conversion using ammonia while both the base metals and the high surface support material serves to store NH<sub>3</sub>. The base metal and high surface area support such as zeolite selected should preferably be one that can store NH<sub>3 </sub>over the widest possible temperature range. Likewise, the base metal selected is preferably one that can convert NO and NO<sub>2 </sub>to N<sub>2 </sub>across the widest possible temperature range and the widest range of NO/NO<sub>2 </sub>ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The advantage of the catalyst system of this invention is the use of a combination of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. The use of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap in the present system allows for much greater storage of NO<sub>x</sub>, because the NO<sub>x </sub>breakthrough that would otherwise happen can be controlled by the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. Additionally, the use of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap as part of this system allows for the operation of the engine at lean conditions for a longer time, and thus provides improved fuel economy. If, for example, a three-way catalyst is used as the NO<sub>x </sub>storage mechanism, NO<sub>x </sub>storage is significantly limited, as well as the production of ammonia. To maximize the reduction of emissions, a three-way catalyst must be operated at stoichiometric conditions. Accordingly, unless the three-way catalyst is run on the rich side 100% of the time, ammonia production is significantly less than for a typical lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. As set forth above, the efficiency of a three-way catalyst is compromised if it is operated at conditions other than at stoichiometric conditions. Thus the combination of a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst allows for significant NO<sub>x </sub>storage and ammonia production and thus increases net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst constitute alternating zones in a single substrate and/or a single catalytic converter can. This zoned design, as shown in three different embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>, is believed to maximize the reaction between ammonia and NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, three zoned catalyst system embodiments were evaluated on a laboratory flow reactor. The total catalyst system dimensions were held constant at a 1&#x2033; diameter and 2&#x2033; length. The first system, labeled &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;, had a 1&#x2033; long lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap followed by a 1&#x2033; long NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. In the second system, labeled &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>b</i>&#x201d;, the catalyst samples were sliced in half to yield alternating 1-2&#x2033; long sections. Finally, in the third system, labeled &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>c</i>&#x201d;, the same catalyst samples were further cut in half to yield &#xbc;&#x2033; long sections, again of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst technologies. It should be noted that each time the catalysts were sliced, as shown in &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>b</i>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>c</i>&#x201d;, the overall length of the catalyst system was reduced slightly, approximately 3/16&#x2033; total. The alternating lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst zones can be created in a single substrate or the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst prepared, cut as desired and then placed adjacent one another in a single can. The zones are preferably formed in a single substrate. However, cut substrates placed in alternating fashion also exhibit improved net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Under the zoned catalyst designs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>, where alternating lean NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst zones are provided, the ammonia formed by the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap is believed to be immediately adsorbed by the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst for use in the NO<sub>x </sub>conversion reaction. It is further believed that the greater the separation between the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst, the greater chance there is for the ammonia to be converted back into NO<sub>x</sub>. It is further believed that oxygen is more abundant in the back of a catalyst substrate and thus the oxygen may be available to effectuate the unwanted conversion of the ammonia back to nitrogen oxide. Accordingly, if the catalyst substrate is too long, there may be some undesired conversion that takes place; and thus in a preferred embodiment, the substrate is designed so that ammonia is available for immediate reaction with NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i>illustrate laboratory reactor data of the three different zoned catalyst system embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>. This laboratory data was obtained with the three catalyst systems operating at a 250&#xb0; C. inlet gas temperature and operating with 50 second lean and 5 second rich cycles. Additionally, the inlet concentration of the NO<sub>x </sub>feed gas was 500 ppm and the overall space velocity was 15,000 per hour. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, with the use of a two-zoned catalyst system as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, approximately 50 ppm of NO is emitted. This two-zone catalyst system resulted in a gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion of 95% and a net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion of 66%. The four-zone catalyst embodiment, depicted as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, significantly reduced NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, well below the 15 ppm range, to result in gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion of 99% and a net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion of 86%. Finally, as illustrated by the eight zoned catalyst embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>, gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is 100% and net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is 97.5%. The improvement comes from the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O, elimination of the NH<sub>3 </sub>breakthrough and reduction of NO<sub>x</sub>. Accordingly, as the catalyst system is zoned down from 1&#x2033; sections to &#xbc;&#x2033; sections, the test results revealed an associated improvement in net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, a zoned catalyst, with alternating lean NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalysts in 1&#x2033; to &#xbc;&#x2033; sections significantly improves the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion from 66% to 97.5%. In addition, the gross NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is improved from 95% to 100%. In general, the improvement in the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion is the function of the elimination of the ammonia slip, reduction in N<sub>2</sub>O, and extra NO<sub>x </sub>reduction related to the NH<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>x </sub>reaction on the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. It is further believed that the drop in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions is likely due to a higher fraction of the NO<sub>x </sub>reduction reaction proceeding on the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst rather than the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. NO<sub>x </sub>reduction over a platinum-containing-lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap results in high levels of N<sub>2</sub>O generation, whereas the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst has a high selectivity to nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<b>6</b><i>c </i>depicts laboratory data obtained using the three-zoned catalyst embodiments originally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>at a 200&#xb0; C. inlet gas temperature operating with a 25 second lean cycle and a 5 second rich cycle. As compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, it should be noted that shortening the lean time from 50 seconds, as used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, to 25 seconds, resulted in a substantial higher steady emission of ammonia&#x2014;a fact which results in reduced net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion rates, as compared to the data charted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<b>6</b><i>c</i>, the use of smaller zoned sections from two zones to eight zones, and thus 1&#x2033; sections down to &#xbc;&#x2033; sections, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>c</i>, improves the net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion from 50% to 81%. Again, this improvement is believed to come mainly from the reduction of ammonia breakthrough and a small reduction in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. This lab data was obtained with an inlet concentration of the NO<sub>x </sub>feed gas at 500 ppm and an overall space velocity at 15,000 per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As set forth above, in the preferred embodiment, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap washcoat and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR washcoat are combined in a single substrate rather than placing the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR formulation downstream of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber as two separate catalyst substrates. Under this embodiment, the catalyst formulations can be incorporated together by mixing or layering the washcoats on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>c </i>show three proposed washcoat configurations incorporating the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR formulations into the same substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the first and second proposed configurations have the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR washcoat formulations on the bottom and top layer, respectively. It is believed that the top layer could be a highly porous structure that allows better and faster contact between the chemicals and gas phase and the active sites in the second layer. The third configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, involves the use of a one layer washcoat containing both lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR washcoat formulations. Under this third configuration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, the washcoat composition of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst could be homogeneously or heterogeneously mixed. For a heterogeneously mixed composition, the formulation of the lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst are separated. However, they contact each other in varying degrees by controlling the size of the grain structures. The homogeneously mixed composition allows for a more intimate contact between the two formulations and is thus preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The invention also contemplates engineering such combinations within the pores of the monolithic substrate. An example of this is incorporating washcoat into porous substrates used for filtering diesel particulate matter. Thus, this lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap/NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst concept can be integrated into diesel particulate matter devices.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">This very active SCR reaction of NO<sub>x </sub>and ammonia proceeds with or without oxygen present. Koebel et al. reports that the fastest SCR reaction involves equal molar amounts of NO and NO<sub>2</sub>. NO and NO<sub>2 </sub>then react with two NH<sub>3 </sub>to yield N<sub>2 </sub>in the absence of oxygen. In contrast, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber reaction of NO<sub>x </sub>plus CO is highly reactive only in an oxygen-free environment. In a lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber system, NO<sub>x </sub>is adsorbed during the lean cycle duration, NO<sub>x </sub>is not reduced. Accordingly, NO<sub>x </sub>reduction is limited to only the rich pulse time duration. On the other hand, the lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber+NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system allows for NO<sub>x </sub>reduction reaction to proceed during both the lean and rich time durations. Accordingly, ammonia as a reductant can be considered as a much more robust reductant than carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As set forth above, the fastest SCR reaction involves equal molar amounts of NO and NO<sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the impact of varying NO:NO<sub>2 </sub>ratios after hydrothermal aging. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph of three NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst formulations over a wide NO:NO<sub>2 </sub>range. In the laboratory, it was possible to control the NO:NO<sub>2 </sub>ratio entering the downstream NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst. Accordingly, the NO:NO<sub>2 </sub>ratio entering the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst was solely dependent on the upstream lean NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber. In some cases, the majority of the feed NO<sub>x </sub>(especially NO<sub>x </sub>spikes) are made up of mostly NO rather than NO<sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, it is believed that the catalyst formulations of this invention will enhance reported net NO<sub>x </sub>efficiency&#x2014;and thus the preferred catalyst is one that is capable of operating across the broadest range of NO:NO<sub>2 </sub>ratios, and at a full spectrum of temperature ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In general, since NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalysts do not contain precious metals, they are significantly less costly than a typical lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap. Accordingly, it is more cost effective to have an overall catalyst system containing a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap adsorber and an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system, rather than one that uses two lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap adsorbers. Additionally, the incorporation of both a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR washcoat into a single substrate will significantly reduce substrate costs.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another embodiment of this invention, NH<sub>3 </sub>and NO<sub>x </sub>in an exhaust stream are reduced using a stoichiometric three-way catalyst system. This three-way catalyst system has particular application for high speed/high flow rate conditions (i.e., USO6 conditions). Currently, three three-way catalysts are used for such high speed condition applications, wherein the third three-way catalyst is primarily directed to NO<sub>x </sub>removal for high speed/high flow rate conditions. Under this alternate embodiment, the third three-way catalyst can be substituted with an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst to store NH<sub>3 </sub>for reaction with NO<sub>x </sub>to improve net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion, eliminate NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions and reduce catalyst costs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To improve net NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>reduction, the second three-way catalyst can be modified to enhance the three-way catalyst's ability to generate NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions. To this end, in a preferred embodiment, the three-way catalyst is designed to generate desirable NH<sub>3 </sub>creation by using platinum as the precious metal of the three-way catalyst, by placing platinum on the outer layer of the three-way catalyst to maximize the NO+H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;NH<sub>3 </sub>reaction. Likewise, the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the three-way catalyst can be removed to further promote the creation of &#x201c;desirable&#x201d; NH<sub>3</sub>. By doing so, the NH<sub>3 </sub>purposely generated during rich operation can then be stored by the NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst for subsequent reaction with NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, and thereby control both NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions under all operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When a car is operated under rich conditions, the air/fuel ratio is less than 14.6, hydrogen is produced in the exhaust via the water-gas shift reaction: CO+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>. The hydrogen that is produced then reacts with NO<sub>x </sub>as it passes over the precious metal surface to create &#x201c;desirable&#x201d; ammonia. The ammonia produced is then stored on an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst to help reduce net NO<sub>x </sub>conversion. The reaction of NO<sub>x</sub>+NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O can then take place on a separate NH<sub>3 </sub>selective catalyst, capable of converting NO<sub>2 </sub>and NO to N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a stoichiometric three-way catalyst/NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst system <b>10</b> is depicted, including a first three-way catalyst <b>14</b> positioned in close proximity to the engine <b>12</b> to reduce cold start emissions. The second three-way catalyst <b>16</b> is modified as described above to enhance the ability of the second three-way catalyst <b>16</b> to generate NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions. Downstream of the second three-way catalyst <b>16</b> is an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst <b>18</b> that functions to store NH<sub>3 </sub>produced by the modified second three-way catalyst <b>16</b> for reaction with NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, to reduce both NO<sub>x </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">By substituting the third three-way catalyst as currently used with an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst and thereby eliminating the need for a third precious metal containing catalyst, significant cost savings can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should further be noted that this invention also contemplates the use of a three-way catalyst, in combination with a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap and an NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;SCR catalyst.</p>
