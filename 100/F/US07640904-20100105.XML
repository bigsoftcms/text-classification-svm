<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to vane-type camshaft phasers for varying the phase relationship between crankshafts and camshafts in internal combustion engines; more particularly, to such phasers wherein a rotor vane and/or a stator lobe includes a compressible radial seal element for wiping the stator wall and/or rotor hub to prevent leakage around the rotor; and most particularly, to a phaser having an improved one-piece compressible wiper seal element disposed in the rotor vanes and/or the stator lobes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Camshaft phasers for varying the phase relationship between the crankshaft and a camshaft of an internal combustion engine are well known. A prior art vane-type phaser generally comprises a plurality of outwardly-extending vanes on a rotor interspersed with a plurality of inwardly-extending lobes on a stator, forming alternating advance and retard chambers between the vanes and lobes. Engine oil is supplied via a multiport oil control valve (OCV), in accordance with an engine control module, to either the advance or retard chambers as required to meet current or anticipated engine operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a typical prior art vane-type cam phaser, the tip of each rotor vane and stator lobe is provided with a compressible seal element for wiping the cylindrical wall of the opposite member to prevent leakage between the advance and retard chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first known wiper seal element utilizes a two-piece construction consisting of a plastic wiper blade and backing spring disposed within the vane or lobe to load the wiper blade against the stator or rotor surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second known wiper seal element utilizes a two-piece seal disposed in an axially-extending groove formed in the vane or lobe tip. Typically, an elastomeric spring is overmolded onto a rigid plastic wiper-shaped substrate. This configuration requires two successive manufacturing steps and two different materials to provide a single wiper element, creating undesired manufacturing cost and complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many prior art wiper configurations also require significant tolerance control on the dimensions of the groove in which the wiper element is disposed. The depth of the groove can affect the spring force on the wiper element, and the width of the groove can affect control of oil leakage behind the wiper element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed in the art is an improved wiper seal element that is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, is of one-piece construction, is durable, and is self actuating to urge itself continuously against a stator or rotor wall.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is further needed in the art is an improved wiper seal system that is tolerant of manufacturing variability in the depth and width of a groove in the tip of a rotor vane or stator lobe.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a principal object of the present invention to improve the reliability of a wiper seal element in a vane-type camshaft phaser.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to reduce the manufacturing cost and complexity of a phaser wiper seal element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a still further object of the present invention to reduce the manufacturing cost and complexity of forming a tip groove by relaxing the width and depth tolerances required of the groove to seal the phaser against leakage between the advance and retard chambers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Briefly described, a vane-type camshaft phaser in accordance with the invention for varying the timing of combustion valves in an internal combustion engine includes a rotor having a plurality of vanes disposed in a stator having a plurality of lobes, the interspersion of vanes and lobes defining a plurality of alternating valve timing advance and valve timing retard chambers with respect to the engine crankshaft. During rotation of the rotor within the stator, the tips of the vanes sweep past concave cylindrical walls of the stator, and the tips of the lobes sweep past convex cylindrical walls of the rotor hub. Each vane and lobe tip is provided with an axially extending groove having an outward expansion of width. A wiper seal element is disposed in the groove for wiping the opposing wall. The wiper seal element is formed by cutting and folding from a single piece of sheet material, preferably a spring steel, and has folded wings that extend into the groove. The wings must be slightly compressed for the wiper seal element to fit into the groove. The spring loading of the wings against the tapered walls of the groove acts to urge the wiper seal element out of the groove and toward the opposing wall, thus ensuring a continuous forced sealing contact of the wiper seal element with the opposing stator or rotor wall and with the walls of the groove during use of the camshaft phaser.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A system in accordance with the invention thus comprises an improved vane or lobe groove having tapering walls and a folded wiper seal element disposed in the groove.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary prior art vane-type cam phaser <b>10</b> includes a pulley or sprocket <b>12</b> for engaging a timing chain or belt (not shown) operated by an engine crankshaft (not shown). The upper surface <b>14</b> of pulley/sprocket <b>12</b> forms a first wall of a plurality of hydraulic chambers in the assembled phaser. A stator <b>16</b> is disposed against surface <b>14</b> and is sealed thereto by a first seal ring <b>18</b>. Stator <b>16</b> is rotationally immobilized with respect to pulley/sprocket <b>12</b>. Stator <b>16</b> is provided with a plurality of inwardly-extending lobes <b>20</b> circumferentially spaced apart for receiving a rotor <b>21</b> including outwardly extending vanes <b>22</b> which extend into the spaces between lobes <b>20</b>. Hydraulic advance and retard chambers are thus formed between lobes <b>20</b> and vanes <b>22</b>. A thrust washer <b>24</b> is concentrically disposed against rotor <b>21</b>, and cover plate <b>26</b> seals against stator <b>16</b> via a second seal ring <b>28</b>. Bolts <b>30</b> extend through bores <b>32</b> in stator <b>16</b> and are received in threaded bores <b>34</b> in pulley/sprocket <b>12</b>, immobilizing the stator with respect to the pulley/sprocket. In installation to an engine camshaft, phaser <b>10</b> is secured via a central bolt (not shown) through thrust washer <b>24</b> which is covered by cover plug <b>36</b> which is threaded into bore <b>38</b> in cover plate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each rotor vane <b>22</b> is provided with an axial groove <b>23</b> along the vane tip for receiving a resilient seal element <b>25</b> for sealingly wiping a cylindrically concave inner wall <b>27</b> of stator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Likewise, each stator lobe <b>20</b> is provided with an axial groove <b>29</b> along the lobe tip for receiving a resilient seal element <b>31</b> for sealingly wiping a cylindrically convex outer wall <b>33</b> of rotor hub <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref>, an improved wiper seal element <b>125</b> is shown. (It should be recognized that the improved wiper seal element <b>125</b> disclosed herein is equally suitable as a direct replacement for either of prior art vane seal <b>25</b> or prior art lobe seal element <b>31</b> after modification of prior art vane groove <b>23</b> and prior art lobe groove <b>29</b> in accordance with the invention as described hereinbelow. For convenience, the improved wiper seal element is labeled herein only as the vane seal replacement <b>125</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a currently-preferred method of manufacturing wiper seal element <b>125</b>, an is element blank <b>180</b> is formed as by stamping from sheet stock of an appropriate material, which may be a metal or a plastic, and preferably is a spring stainless steel. Blank <b>180</b> includes first and second longitudinal wings <b>182</b> defining leaf springs and optionally first and second end wings <b>184</b> formable by folding blank <b>180</b> along dotted lines <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>, respectively, to provide a three-dimensional wiper seal element <b>125</b> having wings <b>182</b>, <b>184</b> extending at an angle from a central wiping portion <b>190</b>. Optionally, a longitudinal central rib <b>191</b> may be formed in central wiping portion <b>190</b>, or portion <b>190</b> may be formed as a crown without rib <b>191</b>, to provide essentially line contact between central wiping portion <b>190</b> and an opposing surface to be wiped, thereby reducing contact area. Friction-reducing coatings of central wiping portion <b>190</b> and/or central rib <b>191</b> are contemplated. Preferably end wings <b>184</b> are tapered to approximate the corresponding taper angle <b>194</b>, <b>198</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) of the vane or lobe groove, described below, into which wiper seal element <b>125</b> is to be inserted, thereby helping to control leakage behind wiper seal element <b>125</b> or past the end wings <b>184</b> thereof. Further, when formed, wiping portion may be drawn away from corners <b>185</b> where wings <b>182</b>, <b>184</b> meet, to reduce a potential oil leak path through the open corners. Note that longitudinal wings <b>182</b> in their relaxed state are non-resiliently and permanently folded from the plane of central wiping portion <b>190</b> by, for example, only about 90&#xb0; (shown as angle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Note also that wings <b>182</b> act as leaf springs when compressed inward through angle B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an improved camshaft rotor vane <b>122</b> in accordance with the invention includes a vane groove <b>123</b> having sides <b>192</b> that diverge by an included taper angle <b>194</b>. Improved wiper seal element <b>125</b> is inserted into groove <b>123</b> by resiliently compressing wings <b>182</b> toward one another along fold lines <b>186</b>. In such a compressed state, a vector is created urging wings <b>182</b> outwards of groove <b>123</b> and toward concave inner wall <b>27</b> of stator <b>16</b> to form a dynamic hydraulic seal of central portion <b>190</b> against passage of oil along inner wall <b>27</b> between advance and retard chambers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. Note that the outward pressure of wings <b>182</b> against sides <b>192</b> effectively seals against leakage of oil around wiper seal element <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an improved camshaft stator lobe <b>120</b> in accordance with the invention includes a lobe groove <b>129</b> having sides <b>196</b> that diverge by an included taper angle <b>198</b> which may be equal to angle <b>194</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or not. Improved wiper seal element <b>125</b> is inserted into groove <b>129</b> by resiliently compressing wings <b>182</b> toward one another along fold lines <b>186</b>. In such a compressed state, a vector is created urging wings <b>182</b> outwards of lobe groove <b>129</b> and toward convex outer wall surface <b>33</b> of rotor hub <b>35</b> to form a dynamic hydraulic seal of central portion <b>190</b> against passage of oil along outer wall <b>33</b> between advance and retard chambers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. Note that the outward pressure of wings <b>182</b> against sides <b>196</b> effectively seals against leakage of oil around wiper seal element <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Because of the line contact created by the compression of wings <b>182</b> into groove <b>123</b> or <b>129</b>, the dimensional accuracy of these grooves is much relaxed over that of prior art grooves <b>23</b> and <b>29</b>, thereby reducing the cost of manufacture of an improved camshaft phaser <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some camshaft phasers, seals are required on only the rotor vanes and are omitted from the stator lobes. Such phasers are fully comprehended by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the invention has been described by reference to various specific embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes may be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but will have full scope defined by the language of the following claims.</p>
