<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a water-cooled internal combustion engine cooled by circulating cooling water. More specifically, the invention relates to a structure forming water jackets in the cylinder head of a water-cooled internal combustion engine to be applied to, for example, an outboard motor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cylinder head of a known water-cooled internal combustion engine disclosed in, for example, JP-A 2000-159190 is provided with an exhaust manifold passage through which the exhaust gas discharged from a plurality of combustion chambers flows, and water jackets including a combustion chamber water jacket surrounding combustion chambers and an exhaust passage water jacket surrounding the exhaust manifold passage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the exhaust manifold passage is formed in the cylinder head, it is preferable, in view of improving the durability of the cylinder head, to reduce differences in temperature among combustion chamber walls forming the combustion chambers and exhaust passage walls forming the exhaust passages including the exhaust manifold passage, i.e., to make the temperatures of the combustion chamber walls and the exhaust passage walls uniform. The combustion chamber water jacket has an intricate arrangement of passages because the cylinder head is provided with intake valves, exhaust valves and ignition plugs. Thus the cooling water has difficulty in smoothly flowing through the combustion chamber water jacket as compared with flowing through the exhaust passage water jacket having a comparatively simple arrangement of passages. Therefore, if the combustion chamber water jacket and the exhaust passage water jacket are connected simply, the respective temperatures of the combustion chamber walls and the exhaust passage walls are likely to differ from each other and the uniformity of temperature distribution in the cylinder head is worsened.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, the exhaust passage water jacket and the exhaust passages including the exhaust manifold passage are formed, for example, by cores placed in a master mold for casting the cylinder head. Although it is preferable to surround a large part of the exhaust manifold passage by a water jacket to cool the exhaust passage walls forming the exhaust manifold passage efficiently, a casting mold including cores having an intricate shape is needed to form such a water jacket surrounding cores for forming the exhaust manifold passage. The mold and cores having such an intricate shape increases the manufacturing cost of the cylinder head. When only the exhaust passages are formed by using cores, not to mention when both the water jackets and the exhaust passages are formed by using cores, it is desirable that positions of core supports for supporting the cores in the master mold do not make the mold for forming the water jackets intricate and facilitate supporting the cores in the master mold. When a through hole for receiving an exhaust gas measuring device is extended through the water jacket, the area of parts of the exhaust passage walls covered with the water jacket decreases and the exhaust passage wall cooling effect is reduced accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing problems and it is therefore an object of the present invention to improve the uniformity of temperature distribution on the combustion chamber walls and the exhaust passage walls of a water-cooled internal combustion engine provided with an exhaust manifold passage to improve the uniformity of temperature distribution in the cylinder head of the water-cooled internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a water-cooled internal combustion engine provided with an exhaust passage water jacket having a simple shape, surrounding an exhaust manifold passage formed in the cylinder head, and capable of exercising a necessary cooling effect and of facilitating supporting cores for forming an exhaust manifold passage. A further object of the present invention is to facilitate placing a core for forming an exhaust manifold passage in a mold, to improve the stability of the core for forming the exhaust manifold passage, to facilitate parting molds and to reduce the cost of a cylinder head by avoiding increasing through holes opening into the exhaust manifold passage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A water-cooled internal combustion engine in an aspect of the present invention includes: a cylinder block provided with a plurality of cylinders aligned in a row; and a cylinder head defining combustion chambers respectively corresponding to the cylinders, and provided with an exhaust manifold passage into which exhaust gas discharged from the combustion chambers through exhaust ports flows, and a cylinder head water jacket for cooling water including a combustion chamber water jacket surrounding the combustion chambers and an exhaust passage water jacket around the exhaust manifold passage; wherein the exhaust passage water jacket is divided into an upstream water jacket and a downstream water jacket by a flow restricting means, and a part on the upstream side of the flow restricting means of the upstream water jacket is connected to the combustion chamber water jacket(<b>70</b>) to make the cooling water flow from the upstream water jacket into the combustion chamber water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The flow restricting means dividing the exhaust passage water jacket into the upstream and the downstream water jacket forces the cooling water into the combustion chamber water jacket. Therefore, the amount of the cooling water used for cooling the combustion chamber walls is large as compared with that can be used for the same purpose when the flow restricting means is used and hence the combustion chamber walls can be effectively cooled by the sufficient cooling water. An exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage is cooled by the cooling water flowing through the exhaust passage water jacket on the upstream side of the combustion chamber water jacket. The exhaust passage walls are cooled by the cooling water flowing through the exhaust passage water jacket, and the combustion chamber walls are cooled effectively by a large quantity of the cooling water. Consequently, the uniformity of temperature distribution in the combustion chamber walls and the exhaust passage walls can be improved and the uniformity of temperature distribution in the cylinder head is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, the downstream water jacket can be connected to the combustion chamber water jacket so that the cooling water flowing through the downstream water jacket may flow from a part on the downstream side of the flow restricting means of the downstream water jacket into the combustion chamber water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus the cooling of the combustion chambers is promoted and the uniformity of temperature distribution in the cylinder head is further improved because the cooling water flows also through the downstream water jacket into the combustion chamber water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, the cylinder head of the water-cooled internal combustion engine may be provided with connecting passages through which part of the cooling water flowing in the upstream water jacket flows into the downstream water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cooling water that has thus flowed from the upstream water jacket into the downstream water jacket promotes cooling the exhaust passage walls forming the exhaust manifold passage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the exhaust passage water jacket serves also as a bypass water jacket through which part of the cooling water flowing in the upstream water jacket flows into the downstream water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus part of the cooling water flowing in the upstream water jacket flows through the bypass water jacket into the downstream water jacket. Therefore, the exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage is cooled by the cooling water flowing through the bypass water jacket. Use of the cooling water flowing through the bypass water jacket in addition to the cooling water flowing through the upstream and the downstream water jacket for cooling the exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage promotes cooling the exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the exhaust passage water jacket has an inlet, the upstream water jacket has an inlet, and those inlets coincide with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus the combustion chamber wall and the exhaust passage wall can be concurrently effectively cooled, and the cooling water flows in a serial flow from the exhaust passage water jacket into the combustion chamber water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, an inlet of the cylinder head water jacket of the cylinder head serves as inlets of the exhaust passage water jacket, and an outlet of the cylinder head water jacket serves also as an outlet of the combustion chamber water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus the cooling water flows directly from the exhaust passage water jacket into the combustion chamber water jacket, and the exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage and the combustion chamber wall can be effectively cooled by the cooling water flowing through the exhaust passage water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A water-cooled internal combustion engine in a further aspect of the present invention includes: a cylinder block provided with a plurality of cylinders; and a cylinder head defining combustion chambers respectively corresponding to the cylinders, provided with an exhaust manifold passage into which the exhaust gas discharged from the combustion chambers flows, and a cylinder head water jacket including an exhaust passage water jacket around the exhaust manifold passage, and formed by casting using a mold; wherein the exhaust passage water jacket and the exhaust manifold passage are ones formed by cores, respectively, in the mold, the exhaust passage water jacket includes a first exhaust passage water jacket nearer to the combustion chambers and a second exhaust passage water jacket farther from the combustion chambers, the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket extend on the opposite sides, with respect to a direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders, of the exhaust manifold passage, respectively, the cylinder head is provided with an outlet of the exhaust manifold passage and a through hole spaced part from the outlet of the exhaust manifold passage and opening into the exhaust manifold passage, and the through hole is formed between the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An exhaust passage wall forming the exhaust manifold passage is cooled effectively by the cooling water flowing through the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket extending on the opposite sides, with respect to a direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders, of the exhaust manifold passage, respectively. The core placed in the mold to form the exhaust manifold passage can be held by using parts of the mold for forming the outlet of the exhaust manifold passage and the through hole spaced apart from the outlet. Since the through hole is formed between the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket extending on the opposite sides, with respect to a direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders, of the exhaust manifold passage, respectively, the complexity of the respective shapes of the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket is not augmented, the core can be easily held and the cylinder head can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the first exhaust passage water jacket nearer to the combustion chambers and the second exhaust passage water jacket farther from the combustion chambers do not overlap the exhaust manifold passage and the through hole entirely as viewed from a position farther from a center plane including the axes of the cylinders than the exhaust manifold passage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus a core for forming the exhaust manifold passage can be inserted into the mold from a position on a side of the exhaust manifold passage farther from the cylinders without being interfered with by parts of the mold for forming the first and the second exhaust passage water jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The outlet of the exhaust manifold passage and the through hole are at the opposite end parts of the exhaust manifold passage with respect to a direction parallel to the row of the plurality of cylinders, respectively. The core for forming the exhaust manifold passage is supported at positions a long distance apart from each other with respect to the direction parallel to the row of cylinders. Since supports supporting the core for forming the exhaust manifold passage are spaced a long distance apart from each other, the core can be stably supported.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The outlet of the exhaust manifold passage may open in the joining surface of the cylinder head to be joined to the cylinder block, and the through hole may be extend through the cylinder head parallel with the joining surface.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mold supporting the core for forming the exhaust manifold passage can be removed in a direction parallel to the joining surface in which the outlet opens, which facilitates parting molds. Since the molds can be readily parted, the molds can be properly parted and hence the cylinder head can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The through hole can holds therein any one of measuring devices including an exhaust gas measuring device for measuring properties of the exhaust gas or any one of tubular members (<b>93</b>) including a sampling tube for sampling the exhaust gas, a tube opening into the atmosphere and a secondary air supply tube for supplying secondary air for exhaust emission control.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The through hole formed to facilitate supporting the core for forming the exhaust manifold passage is used for receiving a measuring device or a tubular member. Therefore, any additional through hole specially for receiving the measuring device or the tubular member is not necessary. Since the through hole does not extend through the water jacket, the area of a part of the exhaust manifold passage surrounded by the water jacket is not decreased by the through hole for receiving the detecting device or the tubular member. Thus any additional through hole is not formed, the cylinder head can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost, and the reduction of the cooling effect of the cooling water flowing through the water jacket can be prevented.</p>

Thus the cooling water can flow smoothly from the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket on the near side of the combustion chamber into the combustion chamber water jacket <b>70</b>. Consequently, the irregularity of temperature distribution in combustion chamber walls W<sub>c </sub>separating the adjacent combustion chambers <b>26</b> is reduced and the uniformity of the temperatures of the combustion chamber walls W<sub>c </sub>is improved.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The inlet of the cylinder head water jacket J<sub>h </sub>coincides with the inlet <b>71</b><i>i </i>of the exhaust passage water jacket <b>71</b>, and the outlet of the cylinder head water jacket J<sub>h </sub>coincides with the outlet <b>70</b><i>e </i>of the combustion chamber water jacket <b>70</b>. Thus the cooling water flows in a serial flow from the exhaust passage water jacket <b>71</b> into the combustion chamber water jacket <b>70</b>. Consequently, the exhaust passage wall W<sub>e </sub>forming the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> and the combustion chamber wall W<sub>c </sub>are cooled effectively by the cooling water flowing through the exhaust passage water jacket <b>71</b> of the cylinder head water jacket J<sub>h</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The exhaust passage water jacket <b>71</b> formed by casting in a mold includes the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber respectively extending on the opposite sides, with respect to the direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>, of the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> formed by a core of a casting mold, the cylinder head <b>21</b> is provided with the outlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>of the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> and the through hole <b>91</b> opening into the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> and spaced from the inlet <b>38</b><i>e</i>, and the through hole <b>91</b> is formed between the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber spaced from each other with respect to the direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>. Therefore, the exhaust passage wall W<sub>e </sub>forming the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> is cooled effectively by the cooling water flowing through the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber respectively extending on the opposite sides, with respect to the direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>, of the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>. The core of the casting mold for forming the exhaust passage can be supported by the outlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>of the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> and the through hole <b>91</b> spaced from the outlet <b>38</b><i>e</i>. Since the through hole <b>91</b> is formed between the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber spaced from each other with respect to the direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>, the through hole <b>91</b> will not make the respective shapes of the water jackets <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> complicated. Thus the core for forming the exhaust passage can be easily supported and the cylinder head can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>, the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber are viewed from a position farther from the center plane than the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>, the water jackets <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> do not entirely cover the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> and the through holes <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> from the far side of the center plane with respect to the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>. Therefore, the core for forming the exhaust passage can be inserted into the master mold without being interfered with by the mold for forming the water jackets <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>. Thus the insertion of the core for forming the exhaust passage into the master mold is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The outlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>and the through hole <b>91</b> are formed in the lower end part <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b</i>, with respect to the direction parallel to the axes of the cylinders C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>, of the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>, respectively. Therefore, the parts supporting the core for forming the exhaust passage are spaced a long distance apart from each other. Thus the core can be stably supported on the support part.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The outlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>opens in the joining surface <b>21</b><i>s</i>, and the through holes <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> penetrate the cylinder head <b>21</b> parallel to the joining surface <b>21</b><i>s</i>. Therefore, the mold supporting the core for forming the exhaust passage can be extracted from the mold in a direction parallel to the joining surface <b>21</b><i>s </i>in which the outlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>opens. Thus the mold can be simply parted. Consequently, rational mold parting can be achieved and the cylinder head <b>21</b> can be manufactured at a low manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The exhaust gas sensor <b>93</b> is received in the through hole <b>91</b> formed to support the core for forming the exhaust passage. Therefore, any additional through hole specially for receiving the exhaust gas sensor <b>93</b> is not necessary and hence the manufacturing cost of the cylinder head <b>21</b> can be reduced. Since the through hole <b>91</b> does not penetrate the water jacket <b>72</b> on the far side of the combustion chamber and the water jacket <b>73</b> on the near side of the combustion chamber, the area of parts of the exhaust passage walls covered with the water jackets <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> is not reduced by the through hole <b>91</b> for receiving the exhaust gas sensor <b>93</b> and hence the cooling effect of the cooling water flowing through the water jackets <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> will not be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The cylinder block outlet water passage <b>65</b> and the cylinder head outlet water passage <b>80</b> are connected and the drain system includes the outlet water passages <b>65</b> and <b>80</b>. Therefore, the cylinder block C does not need to be provided with an additional outlet water passage connected to the drain passage <b>55</b> in addition to the outlet water passage <b>80</b> and hence the cylinder block C can be formed in a small size.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Modifications in the Foregoing Embodiment Will be Described.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The partition wall <b>75</b> serving as a flow restricting means may be provided with an orifice to permit the cooling water to flow from the upstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>a </i>into the downstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>b </i>at a low flow rate The side water jacket <b>74</b> may be omitted and the partition wall <b>75</b> may be provided with a connecting passage that permits the cooling water to flow from the upstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>a </i>into the downstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>b </i>at a flow rate equal to that at which the cooling water flows through the side water jacket <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The upstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>a </i>and the downstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>b </i>may communicate with the supply port <b>60</b> by means of separate inlet water passages, respectively. When the upstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>a </i>and the downstream water jacket <b>72</b><i>b </i>are thus connected to the supply port <b>60</b>, the side water jacket <b>74</b> may be either formed or omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A tube other than the exhaust gas sensor <b>93</b>, such as an exhaust gas sampling tube for sampling the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b>, a tube for opening the exhaust manifold passage <b>38</b> into the atmosphere or a secondary air supply tube for supplying secondary air for purifying the exhaust gas, may be inserted in the through hole <b>91</b>. The through hole <b>91</b> may penetrate the cylinder head <b>21</b> in the direction parallel to the row of the cylinders.</p>
