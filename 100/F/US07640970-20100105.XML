<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2004-73992, filed Sep. 15, 2004, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes, and more particularly to a structure of a heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes, which is applied to an evaporator of a household air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes is a heat exchanger, in which refrigerant flows along a plurality of tubes having a diameter of less than several mm. Such a heat exchanger is widely used by a condenser of a vehicle air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Korean Patent Publication No. 1996-0009342 discloses a structure of a heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes. Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The heat exchanger using the micro-channel tubes comprises a plurality of tubes <b>1</b> laid in a horizontal direction. The tubes <b>1</b> are vertically arranged, and corrugated pins <b>2</b> are interposed between the tubes <b>1</b>. Headers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> for distributing refrigerant into the tubes <b>1</b> or for collecting the refrigerant from the tubes <b>1</b> are placed at both ends of the tubes <b>1</b>. The headers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are made of an aluminum rod member having a circular cross-section, and placed perpendicularly at both ends of the tubes <b>1</b>. The tubes <b>1</b> communicate with the headers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, and separators <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> for dividing the tubes <b>1</b> into several channel groups A, B, and C are installed in the headers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The plural tubes <b>1</b> are divided into an inlet-side channel group A, through which the refrigerant enters to the evaporator, an outlet-side channel group C, through which the refrigerant is discharged from the evaporator, and an intermediate channel group B.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the overall flow of the refrigerant in the heat exchanger is described. The refrigerant flows along all of the tubes <b>1</b> of each of the channel groups A, B, and C in one direction, and then flows along the tubes <b>1</b> of the next groups B and C. That is, the refrigerant, having entered into the tubes <b>1</b> through a refrigerant inlet <b>6</b>, is uniformly distributed into all of the tubes <b>1</b> of the inlet-side channel group A, and flows toward the upper portion of the right header <b>4</b> above the separator <b>11</b>. In the upper portion of the right header <b>4</b> above the separator <b>11</b>, the inlet-side channel group A and the intermediate channel group B communicate with each other, the entered refrigerant flows toward the intermediate channel group B and is transmitted to the lower portion of the left header <b>3</b> below the separator <b>10</b>. Then, the refrigerant, having been transmitted to the left header <b>3</b> through the intermediate channel group B, enters into the lower portion of the right header <b>4</b> below the separator <b>11</b> through the outlet-side channel group C, and is discharged to the outside through a refrigerant outlet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, non-described reference numerals <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> represent caps for closing the ends of the headers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, and non-described reference numerals <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> represent side plates placed on the outer surfaces of the outermost corrugated pins <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above-described heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes, the refrigerant in a gaseous state, having entered into the heat exchanger through the refrigerant inlet <b>6</b>, flows in each of the tubes <b>1</b> from the inlet-side channel group A to the outlet-side channel group C, exchanges heat with air in the tubes <b>1</b> to be condensed to a liquid state, and the refrigerant in the liquid state is discharged to the outside through the refrigerant outlet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes is called various names, i.e., an aluminum heat exchanger due to the material thereof, a flat tube-type heat exchanger due to the shapes of the tubes thereof, and a PFC (parallel flow condenser) due to the flow of the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes is advantageous in that it has heat transfer efficiency higher than that of a pin tube-type heat exchanger, thereby being miniaturized. However, the heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes cannot be used as an evaporator of a household air conditioner due to several problems, as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the evaporator exchanges heat with air of a high temperature rather than air of the temperature thereof, moisture in air is condensed and condensation of water occurs on the surface of the evaporator. In the conventional heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes, which comprises the tubes laid in the horizontal direction, the condensed water formed on the surface of the heat exchanger is gathered in hollow portions of the corrugated pins between the tubes, thus decreasing heat exchanging efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While the speed of flow of air around the vehicle condenser is comparatively rapid, such as 3&#x2dc;4 m/s, the speed of flow of air around the evaporator of the household air conditioner is comparatively slow, such as 0.5&#x2dc;1.5 m/s, thus reducing a heat transfer rate per unit hour. Accordingly, the conventional heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes requires a large heat transfer area.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While the flow of the refrigerant, flowing in the heat exchanger, from the entrance of the refrigerant into the upper portion of one header to the discharge of the refrigerant from the lower portion of the other header, has an S shape, the refrigerant, flowing in the condenser, is condensed from a gaseous state to a liquid state, thus naturally having an S-shaped flow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the number of the tubes <b>1</b> of the outlet-side channel group C is smaller than the number of the tubes of the inlet-side channel group A due to the phase change of the refrigerant, thus minimizing pressure loss in the heat exchanger. However, since the refrigerant flowing in the evaporator is vaporized from the liquid state to the gaseous state, it is difficult to apply the channel structure of the condenser to the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In spite of the above problems, several methods have been proposed for applying the heat exchanger using micro-channel tubes to an evaporator of a household air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Korean Patent Laid-open No. 2003-0063980 discloses a heat exchanger, in which headers are erected horizontally and micro-channel tubes are laid perpendicularly between the headers. Drain holes and line grooves for facilitating the discharge of condensed water are formed in the heat exchanger. Korean Patent Laid-open Nos. 2004-0017447, 2004-0017449, 2004-0017920, and 2004-0019628 disclose structures of heat exchangers for facilitating the discharge of condensed water under the condition that headers and micro-channel tubes are disposed in the same manner as that of the preceding Patent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As disclosed by the above Patents, an evaporator, in which the headers are erected horizontally and the micro-channel tubes are laid perpendicularly between the headers, can discharge a sufficient quantity of the condensed water, but has disadvantages, such as a small heat transfer area and a difficulty in achieving uniform flow of the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the refrigerant at an inlet of the evaporator is in a two-phase state, the refrigerant, which enters into the header of the evaporator, cannot be uniformly distributed to the respective tubes due to the difference of speeds of flow between the gaseous phase and the liquid phase. Particularly, the transmission of the refrigerant from one channel group to another channel group is performed in one header, thus accelerating the above problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an evaporator using micro-channel tubes in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention comprises two heat exchanging units <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, each of which includes a plurality of micro-channel tubes <b>43</b> vertically erected between a pair of headers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, or <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, which may be horizontally laid, so that condensed water flows downward. Hereinafter, the heat exchanging unit, which is placed at a front position, is referred to as a first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b>, and the heat exchanging unit, which is placed at a rear position, is referred to as a second heat exchanging unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b> and the second heat exchanging unit <b>30</b> have the same structure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the structure of the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b> will be described in detail. The first upper header <b>21</b> having the structure of a pipe with a circular cross-section is placed above the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b>. The first upper header <b>21</b> is made of aluminum, and the inside of the first upper header <b>21</b> is divided by a plurality of separators <b>41</b>. The separators <b>41</b> serve to cut off the flow of refrigerant between neighboring portions of the inside of the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b>. Longitudinal holes <b>42</b> perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the first upper header <b>21</b> are formed through the lower surface of the first upper header <b>21</b> having the pipe structure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A plurality of the micro-channel tubes (hereinafter, abbreviated to &#x2018;tubes&#x2019;) <b>43</b> are vertically erected under the lower part of the first upper header <b>21</b>. The tubes <b>43</b> are attached to the first upper header <b>21</b> such that designated lengths of upper ends of the tubes <b>43</b> are inserted into the longitudinal holes <b>42</b>. The insides of the tubes <b>43</b> are divided into plural portions to form fine channels. Since the cross-sections of the tubes <b>43</b> are similar to the structure of a harmonica, the tubes <b>43</b> are referred to as harmonica tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Corrugated pins <b>44</b> are intercalated between the micro-channel tubes <b>43</b>. Generally, louvers <b>44</b><i>a </i>are formed on the corrugated pins <b>44</b> to facilitate heat transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Typically, when the evaporator is installed, the surface of the evaporator is perpendicular to the flow direction of air. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, water condensed on the surface of the evaporator flows down along the surfaces of the tubes <b>43</b>, which are erected vertically, by its own weight. Water condensed on the corrugated pins <b>44</b> flows down by the gradient of the corrugated pins <b>44</b>, and then flows down along the surfaces of the tubes <b>43</b> or flows down again along the corrugated pins <b>44</b> at contacts between the corrugated pins <b>44</b> and the tubes <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first lower header <b>22</b> placed below the tubes <b>43</b> has the same structure as that of the first upper header <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In correspondence with the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b>, the second heat exchanging unit <b>30</b> includes a second upper header <b>31</b>, a micro-channel tubes <b>43</b>, a corrugated pins <b>44</b>, and a second lower header <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Inlet pipes <b>45</b>, to draw the refrigerant into the evaporator, the refrigerant having passed through an expansion valve (not shown) of the conventional refrigerating cycle, into the evaporator, and outlet pipes <b>46</b>, to discharge the refrigerant, having been vaporized by the evaporator, to the outside of the evaporator, are connected to the lower portions of the first lower header <b>22</b> and the second lower header <b>32</b>. The refrigerant discharged from the outlet pipes <b>46</b> is gathered in a collecting manifold <b>47</b> connected to the lower ends of the outlet pipes <b>46</b>, and is transmitted to a compressor (not shown) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To communicate the refrigerant between the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b> and the second heat exchanging unit <b>30</b>, the first upper header <b>21</b> and the second upper header <b>31</b> are connected by a plurality of return pipes <b>48</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow of the refrigerant in the evaporator using the micro-channel tubes in correspondence with the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An upper portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the flow of the refrigerant in the second heat exchanging unit <b>30</b>, and a lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the flow of the refrigerant in the first heat exchanging unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, the inside of each of the headers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> is divided by a plurality of the separators <b>41</b>. In the evaporator, in accordance with the first embodiment, the inside of each of the headers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> is divided into four portions, and the four portions have different sizes to form the flow of the refrigerant as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a left portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the second lower header <b>32</b> and a left portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second upper header <b>31</b> have a same size, and the tubes <b>43</b>, which are installed between the left portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the second lower header <b>32</b> and the left portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second upper header <b>31</b>, form one channel group G<b>1</b>. The remaining portions <b>32</b><i>b</i>, <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and <b>32</b><i>d </i>of the second lower header <b>32</b> and the corresponding remaining portions of <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, and <b>31</b><i>d </i>of the second upper header <b>31</b>, respectively, have the same sizes, and form channel groups G<b>2</b>, G<b>3</b>, and G<b>4</b>. In the same manner as the second lower header <b>32</b> and the second upper header <b>31</b>, the first upper header <b>21</b> is divided into four portions <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, and <b>21</b><i>d</i>, and the first lower header <b>22</b> is divided into four portions <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and <b>22</b><i>d</i>, and form channel groups G<b>5</b>, G<b>6</b>, G<b>7</b>, and G<b>8</b>, in order.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The number of the tubes <b>43</b> of any one of the channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>6</b>, and G<b>8</b> is smaller than a number of the tubes <b>43</b> of any one of the channel groups G<b>2</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, and G<b>7</b>. The above difference of numbers of the tubes <b>43</b> among the channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, G<b>6</b>, G<b>7</b>, and G<b>8</b> reduces the decrease in the pressure of the refrigerant in the evaporator in consideration of the expanded volume of the refrigerant when the refrigerant is vaporized in the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The inlet pipe <b>45</b> is connected to the portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the second lower header <b>32</b> connected to the channel group G<b>1</b>. The refrigerant, having entered into the second lower header <b>32</b> through the inlet pipe <b>45</b>, is distributed at the portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>into the tubes <b>43</b> of the channel group G<b>1</b>. The divided parts of the refrigerant flowing along the tubes <b>43</b> of the channel group G<b>1</b> are collected at the portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second upper header <b>31</b>, and the collected refrigerant is distributed again into the return pipes <b>48</b> and is transmitted to the portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the first upper header <b>21</b>. The refrigerant is divided again into the tubes <b>43</b> of the channel group G<b>5</b> and is transmitted to the portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the first lower header <b>22</b>. The refrigerant at the portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the first lower header <b>22</b> is discharged to the outside through the outlet pipe <b>46</b> connected to the portion <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the refrigerant passes through the channel groups G<b>1</b> and G<b>5</b>, the refrigerant is vaporized by exchanging heat with peripheral air. The channel group G<b>1</b>, through which the refrigerant enters the evaporator, is an inlet-side channel group, and the channel group G<b>5</b>, through which the refrigerant is discharged from the evaporator, is an outlet-side channel group. The route of the refrigerant from one inlet pipe <b>45</b> to the opposite outlet pipe <b>46</b> is referred to as a refrigerant circuit. In the same manner as the channel groups G<b>1</b> and G<b>5</b>, the channel groups G<b>3</b>, G<b>6</b>, and G<b>8</b> are inlet-side channel groups, and the channel groups G<b>2</b>, G<b>4</b>, and G<b>7</b> are outlet-side channel groups, thus forming three refrigerant circuits. Accordingly, a total of four refrigerant circuits is formed in the evaporator, and the flow directions of the refrigerant of the neighboring refrigerant circuits are opposite to each other. The flow directions are designed in consideration of the difference of the numbers of the tubes <b>43</b> among the channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, G<b>6</b>, G<b>7</b>, and G<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, the number of the tubes <b>43</b> of any one of the channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>6</b>, and G<b>8</b> is smaller than the number of the tubes <b>43</b> of any one of the channel groups G<b>2</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, and G<b>7</b>. The above difference in the numbers of the tubes <b>43</b> among the channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, G<b>6</b>, G<b>7</b>, and G<b>8</b> denotes that the cross sectional areas of flow channels of the outlet-side channel groups G<b>2</b>, G<b>4</b>, G<b>5</b>, and G<b>7</b> are greater than the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of the inlet-side channel groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>3</b>, G<b>6</b>, and G<b>8</b>. Since the evaporator receives the refrigerant in a liquid state and discharges the refrigerant in a gaseous state, generally, the evaporator has the above-described structure to reduce the decrease of the pressure in the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the refrigerant is transmitted from one channel group to the next channel group in the conventional evaporator, since the refrigerant flows in the header and is distributed into the tubes <b>43</b>, it is difficult to uniformly distribute the refrigerant. In the evaporator, in accordance with this embodiment, since the refrigerant is transmitted through a plurality of the return pipes connecting the headers, the refrigerant may be uniformly distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view of an evaporator using micro-channel tubes in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In the same manner as the evaporator in accordance with the first embodiment, the evaporator in accordance with the second embodiment comprises two heat exchanging units. However, the evaporator of the second embodiment has a refrigerant channel structure differing from that of the evaporator of the first embodiment. That is, the evaporator of the second embodiment has a total of three refrigerant circuits. Each of a first upper header <b>51</b> located at a lower part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and a second upper header <b>52</b> located at an upper part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is divided into three portions by two separators <b>54</b>. In the same manner as that of the evaporator of the first embodiment, the cross sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups are greater than the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups. The first upper header <b>51</b> and the second upper header <b>52</b> communicate with each other by a plurality of return pipes <b>53</b>, thus transmitting refrigerant therebetween. The flow directions of the refrigerant of the neighboring refrigerant circuits are opposite to each other, as shown by the arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view of an evaporator using micro-channel tubes in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. In the same manner as the evaporator in accordance with the second embodiment, the evaporator in accordance with the third embodiment comprises three refrigerant circuits. However, the evaporator of the third embodiment differs from the evaporator of the second embodiment in that the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups are equal to the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups, and the flow directions of the refrigerant of the respective refrigerant circuits are the same. Each of a first upper header <b>61</b> located at a lower part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and a second upper header <b>62</b> located at an upper part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is divided into three portions by separators <b>64</b>. The first upper header <b>61</b> and the second upper header <b>62</b> are connected by a plurality of return pipes <b>63</b>, thus transmitting refrigerant therebetween. As shown by the arrows, the refrigerant flows from the second upper header <b>62</b> to the first upper header <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> a plan view of an evaporator using micro-channel tubes in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the same manner as the evaporator in accordance with the third embodiment, the evaporator in accordance with the fourth embodiment comprises three refrigerant circuits, and the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups are equal to the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups. However, the evaporator of the fourth embodiment differs from the evaporator of the third embodiment in that the number of return pipes <b>73</b> for connecting a first upper header <b>71</b> and a second upper header <b>72</b> of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment is half of the number of the return pipes <b>63</b> of the evaporator of the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph illustrating results of a heat transfer efficiency test (test conditions: Korean Industrial Standard KS C 9306) of the evaporators using micro-channel tubes, which are manufactured to have the same capacity and size, in accordance with the first, second, third, and fourth embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, values on the X-axis from the left denote the evaporators of the first, second, third, and fourth embodiments, and values on the Y-axis represent the percentages of heat-exchanging quantities of the evaporators of the respective embodiments to the heat-exchanging quantity of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In comparison of the evaporators of the third and fourth embodiments, the number of the return pipes of the evaporator of the third embodiment is double the number of the return pipes of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment, but the heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the third embodiment is decreased by 8% when compared with the heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment. This result denotes that the large number of the return pipes is not beneficial to heat transfer efficiency, but the number of the return pipes needs to be adjusted based on the number of the refrigerant circuits or the sizes of the channel groups of the evaporators.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Differing from the evaporator of the fourth embodiment, the evaporator of the second embodiment has cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups that are greater than the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups. In this case, the heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the second embodiment is increased by 9% of the heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment. The evaporator of the first embodiment, in the same manner as the evaporator of the second embodiment, has cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups that are larger than the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups, and further comprises one refrigerant circuit more than the evaporator of the second embodiment. The heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the first embodiment is decreased by 3% of heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator of the fourth embodiment. These results denote that the evaporator in which cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of outlet-side channel groups are greater than the cross-sectional areas of the flow channels of inlet-side channel groups has a high heat exchanging efficiency, and, in order to satisfy the high heat exchanging efficiency, the evaporator requires the proper number of refrigerant circuits.</p>
