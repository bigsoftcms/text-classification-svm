<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a portable cooling device, and more particularly to a cooling device holding a coolant to lower body temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Arts</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a person works outside in a hot and windless environment, especially in physically demanding work such as construction that requires personal protective equipment, they may require a cooling device to prevent heat exposure including heatstroke, heat exhaustion and heat rash.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional cooling device comprises a helmet and a fan. The helmet may have multiple vents. The fan is mounted on the fan and may correspond to the vents to dissipate heat from human head or neck to improve a body cooling system. However, constant airflow toward the head from the fan might cause the person feel faint and uncomfortable, especially in dusty environments. Moreover, using a fan as a heat dissipating way is not efficient when ambient temperatures are high.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides a portable cooling device to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a portable cooling device utilizing a coolant to lower a person's body temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The portable cooling device comprises a vacuum bottle, a pump, an outflow pipe, a thermal exchanger and a return pipe. The vacuum bottle holds a coolant and has an outer casing and a vacuum flask. The outer casing has a chamber. The vacuum flask is mounted in the chamber. The pump is mounted on the vacuum bottle to pump the coolant out of the vacuum bottle. The outflow pipe connects to the pump. The thermal exchanger connects to the outflow pipe and is filled by the coolant and is placed adjacent to a person to lower his body temperature. The return pipe connects between the thermal exchanger and the vacuum bottle to form a flow circle. Consequently, the portable cooling device cools the body temperature. Moreover, having the vacuum bottle to hold and insulate the coolant elongates effective cooling time of the cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>, a portable cooling device in accordance with the present invention comprises a vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>), a pump (<b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A), an outflow pipe (<b>30</b>), a thermal exchanger and a return pipe (<b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>) has an outer casing (<b>11</b>), a vacuum flask (<b>12</b>), an outlet (<b>15</b>), an inlet (<b>16</b>) and a carry assembly (<b>17</b>) and may have an opening (<b>13</b>) and a cap (<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The outer casing (<b>11</b>) has an outer wall and a chamber. The vacuum flask (<b>12</b>) is mounted inside the chamber of the outer casing (<b>11</b>) and is separated from the outer casing (<b>11</b>) by a vacuum space (<b>19</b>) to insulate heat transfer. A coolant being a pre-cooled liquid with high specific heat capacity such as water fills the vacuum flask (<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The outlet (<b>15</b>) is formed on and protrudes through the outer casing (<b>11</b>) and communicates with the vacuum flask (<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inlet (<b>16</b>) is formed on and protrudes through the outer casing (<b>11</b>) and communicates with the vacuum flask (<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The carry assembly (<b>17</b>) is attached to the outer wall of the outer casing (<b>11</b>) and may be hooks, belts, straps or the like to facilitate carrying of the cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The opening (<b>13</b>) is formed through the outer casing (<b>11</b>) and communicates with the vacuum flask (<b>12</b>) and allows filling or exchanging of the coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cap (<b>14</b>) is detachably mounted on the opening (<b>13</b>) to seal the opening (<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pump (<b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A) is mounted on the outer casing (<b>11</b>), connects too the outlet (<b>15</b>) and pumps the coolant from the vacuum flask (<b>12</b>) and may be connected to and controlled by an automatic control system to pump coolant automatically. The pump (<b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A) may be driven by a pumping motor (<b>21</b>) or may be driven by a crank (<b>22</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The outflow pipe (<b>30</b>) is connected to the pump (<b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A), allows the coolant to flow out of the vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>) and has an outflow end and a check valve (<b>31</b>). The check valve (<b>31</b>) is mounted in the outflow pipe (<b>30</b>) to ensure the coolant flows one way.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The thermal exchanger may be made of silica gel, connects to the outflow pipe (<b>30</b>), is filled by the coolant, is disposed adjacent to a person's body to lower his temperature and has an inner cavity (<b>43</b>), an inlet hole (<b>41</b>) and an outlet hole (<b>42</b>). The thermal exchanger may be a helmet (<b>40</b>) corresponding to a head, a sleeve (<b>40</b>A) corresponding to a neck, leg or arm or a bag (<b>40</b>B) for inserting in a clothes pocket or directly contacting with skin.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The inner cavity (<b>43</b>) is formed in the thermal exchanger (<b>40</b>, <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B) for adding coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inlet hole (<b>41</b>) is formed through the thermal exchanger, communicates with the inner cavity (<b>43</b>) of the thermal exchanger, connects to the outflow end of the outflow pipe (<b>30</b>) to allow the coolant to flow into the thermal exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The outlet hole (<b>42</b>) is formed through the thermal exchanger and communicates with the inner cavity (<b>43</b>) of the thermal exchanger to allow warmed coolant to flow out.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The return pipe (<b>50</b>) connects between the outlet hole (<b>42</b>) of the thermal exchanger (<b>40</b>, <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B) and the inlet (<b>16</b>) of the vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>), to allow the warmed coolant to flow back to the vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>) to form a flow circle and may have a check valve (<b>51</b>) and a flow-adjuster (<b>52</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The check valve (<b>51</b>) is mounted in the return pipe (<b>50</b>) to ensure the coolant flows one way.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flow-adjuster (<b>52</b>) is mounted in the return pipe (<b>50</b>) to allow the person to control a flow rate of coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Consequently, the portable cooling device can cool down the body temperature efficiently by removing heat from specific areas of the person's body. Moreover, having the vacuum bottle (<b>10</b>) to hold and insulate the coolant prolongs an effective time of the cooling device and allows the cooling device to be reloaded quickly, cheaply and efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and features of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only. Changes may be made in the details, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
