<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a foam dart gun and the like and in particular to a foam dart gun capable of rapidly firing a plurality of foam darts utilizing energy stored in a series of elastomeric members.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Toy projectile launchers, including toy projectile guns, have utilized numerous arrangements to apply a launching force to a projectile. Launchers that utilize elastomeric, or rubber, bands oftentimes suffer from the band breaking from fatigue or overuse. Also, when a single elastomeric band has been used to propel a projectile there is no retracting or retaining force applied to the elastomeric band. Once released, the elastomeric band is difficult to control, and often alters the trajectory of the toy projectile. Specifically, the elastomeric band may contact the body or fins of the rocket once the elastomeric band is no longer in tension, and interfere with the speed and accuracy of the rocket. Also, a single elastomeric band stores less energy than several combined bands. Velocity, distance, and trajectory suffer as a result. Additionally, constant loading and unloading of a single elastomeric band can permanently stretch the band, which lessens the potential energy capable of being stored in the elastomeric band. As a result, less kinetic energy can be transferred to the projectile when launched. In addition, it is often the case that a user of a foam dart gun is allowed a single shot before having to reload, or cock, the elastomeric band so that a second projectile may be launched. Further, the end of the elastomeric band connected to the projectile is left dangling from the gun. Not only are dangling bands cumbersome to re-load and not in position to receive a dart after being fired, but they also can catch foreign objects and break and pose a danger to the user. Accordingly, a foam dart gun that withstands fatigue and improves control of the elastomeric band(s) after a projectile has been launched would prove useful. Furthermore, there is a significant need for a foam dart gun that allows a user to accurately and rapidly fire successive toy projectiles, including foam darts, at an increased velocity to achieve a greater distance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the present invention is a foam dart launcher having a cylinder with a plurality of hooks disposed at a first end of the cylinder. Inner and outer elastic bands are at a second end of the cylinder and the inner elastic band ends engage a middle portion of the cylinder and the outer band ends engage a distal end of the cylinder. In addition, the outer elastic bands typically engage an inner elastic band to form an elastomeric band assembly. The foam dart gun also has a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The foam dart gun is capable of rapidly firing foam darts and, utilizing the elastomeric band assembly, immediately store the elastomeric members in a controlled manner after the foam darts have been launched. The invention further includes a trigger that actuates deployment of the foam darts each time the trigger is depressed and each time the trigger is released. The manner in which the elastomeric members are secured to the barrel facilitates lowering of elastomeric band replacement costs. Further, multiple foam dart guns are not necessary for a single user because multiple foam darts can be loaded and fired from the same single foam dart gun before reloading is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification, claims, and appended drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For purposes of description herein the terms &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The reference numeral <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally designates a gun <b>10</b> having an elongated, typically cylindrical barrel <b>11</b> with a plurality of rocket retention appendages, typically hooks <b>12</b>, which are disposed at a first end <b>13</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>, which is proximate trigger <b>20</b>. The plurality of hooks <b>12</b> are typically spaced at equal distances on a rim secured by fasteners around the outer circumference of the barrel <b>11</b>. Inner elastic bands <b>14</b> and outer elastic bands <b>15</b> are typically disposed at a second end <b>16</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. The number of hooks <b>12</b> is usually equal to the number of inner elastic bands <b>14</b> and the number of outer elastic bands <b>15</b>. Also, each hook <b>12</b> is typically aligned with a corresponding pair of inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The inner elastic band ends <b>14</b><i>a </i>engage the barrel <b>11</b> between the first and second ends <b>13</b>, <b>16</b>. Typically, the inner elastic band ends <b>14</b><i>a </i>engage the barrel <b>11</b> approximately &#x2153; of the length of the barrel <b>11</b> from a distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. The outer elastic band ends <b>15</b><i>a </i>engage the barrel <b>11</b> near the distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. The outer elastic bands <b>15</b> engage the inner elastic bands <b>14</b>, typically at the mid point of each band.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first end <b>13</b> of the barrel <b>11</b> has an upper handle <b>18</b> adjacent to trigger <b>20</b> and positioned to allow actuation of the trigger <b>20</b>. A lower handle <b>22</b> is disposed on a lower portion of the barrel <b>11</b> at least proximate the first end <b>13</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. The length of the barrel <b>11</b> will typically be at least two to three feet long. The barrel length is generally determined by the strength of the elastomeric bands. Typically, the barrel is approximately 300% of the length of the elastomeric band configuration shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as length <b>29</b>. The barrel <b>11</b> is preferably adapted to be maneuvered by a user by firmly grasping the lower handle <b>22</b> and the upper handle <b>18</b>. The lower handle <b>22</b> is also typically adapted for use by a person's hand or shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the outer elastic band ends <b>15</b><i>a </i>engaged to the distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. As readily seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel typically has a plurality of elastomeric member receiving apertures <b>24</b> preferably evenly spaced about the distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel <b>11</b>. Typically, each of the elastomeric member receiving apertures <b>24</b> have two outwardly extending, opposing grooves <b>25</b> that interconnect the elastomeric member receiving apertures <b>24</b> with retaining apertures <b>28</b>. The retaining apertures <b>28</b> are typically of a smaller diameter than the elastomeric member receiving apertures <b>24</b>. The outer elastic band ends <b>15</b><i>a </i>have a bulbous end <b>26</b> created from the outer elastic band end <b>15</b><i>a </i>being stretched over a spherically-shaped member <b>23</b> (shown in hidden lines) disposed inside a cavity <b>27</b> in the outer elastic band <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The bulbous end <b>26</b> is inserted into the elastomeric member receiving apertures <b>24</b>. Thereafter, the inner and outer elastic band ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>are pinched and slid through the outwardly extending grooves <b>25</b> until the bulbous end <b>26</b> is retained in the retaining apertures <b>28</b> on the interior surface of the barrel <b>11</b>. When loaded, the tension on the outer elastic band forces the bulbous end <b>26</b> against the interior of the barrel <b>11</b>. The bulbous end <b>26</b> prevents the outer elastic band <b>15</b> from withdrawing from the distal end <b>17</b> of the barrel <b>11</b> during use and allows for easy replacement of an individual elastomeric band or band assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the retaining hooks <b>12</b> are adapted to be inserted into a retaining hook receiving aperture <b>30</b> in a rod <b>32</b> disposed at a rear end <b>34</b> of a dart <b>36</b>. The dart <b>36</b> is typically constructed of foam material and includes several fins <b>35</b><i>a</i>. The rod <b>32</b> is typically substantially aligned with a longitudinal axis of the dart <b>36</b>. A front end <b>38</b> of the dart <b>36</b> usually employs one component of a hook and loop fastening system <b>39</b> such as VELCRO&#xae; which, in a game-playing situation, would attach readily to an opponent's vest, utilizing a complementary component of the hook and loop fastening system <b>39</b>. In this manner, one would readily know when the target is &#x201c;hit&#x201d; when playing various games. The front end <b>38</b> of the foam dart <b>36</b> may employ a catch <b>40</b> that releasably connects to the mid-point of each of inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, respectively. During use, numerous foam darts <b>36</b> may be used in connection with the gun <b>10</b>. Each dart engages the gun <b>10</b> by engaging the catch <b>40</b> to the mid-points of both the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. Simultaneously, the hooks <b>12</b> disposed about the outer circumference of the barrel <b>11</b> are inserted into the retaining hook receiving apertures <b>30</b> of the rods <b>32</b> of the foam darts <b>36</b>. This configuration stores potential energy that propels the dart when the dart is fired.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A catch <b>31</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D, is connected at a mid-point of each of inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>&#x2032; and <b>15</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is connected to a catch <b>31</b>. Catch <b>31</b> could be affixed to the midpoint of a single band, but this configuration is presently not preferred. When inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>&#x2032; and <b>15</b>&#x2032; are used, they are received through holes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, respectively, on the catch <b>31</b>. The catch <b>31</b> has a hook <b>33</b> that is designed to engage a slot <b>35</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) disposed in a rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The catch <b>31</b> has a narrow edge <b>31</b><i>c </i>that is designed to slide along the length of the barrel <b>11</b> when the dart <b>36</b> is being launched. Alternatively, a catch <b>31</b>&#x2032;, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, may be utilized. Catch <b>31</b>&#x2032; includes holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and <b>31</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, a hook <b>33</b>&#x2032; and an arcuate barrel engagement portion <b>31</b><i>d </i>that has a convex shape adapted to conform and slidingly engage with the outer circumference of barrel <b>11</b>, thus facilitating steady and consistent launching of foam dart <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> are related to a catch <b>31</b>&#x2033;, which will be disclosed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment including a dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>for use in the foam dart gun <b>10</b>. In this alternative embodiment, the rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>has an outer circumference that is tangential with the outer circumference of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>is typically engaged along a portion of the perimeter of the dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be glued or otherwise affixed to the body of the dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. Also, there may be a channel in the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>for receiving the rod <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, an elastomeric girdle, typically a plastic girdle <b>37</b>, which is typically constructed of a spring-like mesh plastic material as shown, may be used to frictionally engage and thereby secure a portion of the rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>to the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>to prevent the rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>from coming separated from the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The plastic girdle <b>37</b> is designed to tightly squeeze around the outer circumference of the dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>, thus minimizing the likelihood that the rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>will detach from the dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. Generally, the girdle <b>37</b> is of a slightly smaller diameter than the diameter of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>to facilitate frictional engagement of the rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>and foam dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>. In such a case, the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>typically is depressed to temporarily lower the diameter of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>to allow the girdle <b>37</b> to be placed over the dart <b>36</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> illustrate the trigger <b>20</b> and its engagement to a firing apparatus <b>42</b>. A first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> has a plurality of knobs <b>46</b> separated by a plurality of openings <b>47</b>. A second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> is engaged to the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> and has a plurality of knobs <b>49</b> separated by a plurality of openings <b>50</b>. The first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> is typically connected with the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> such that the knobs <b>46</b> of the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> are typically at least substantially aligned with the openings <b>50</b> of the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> and, similarly, the knobs <b>49</b> of the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> are typically at least substantially aligned with openings <b>47</b> of the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b>. The first and second circular rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> are spring-biased by an internal torsion spring <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) to rotate in the direction of arrow <b>52</b>. The trigger <b>20</b> is spring-biased to a forward position and is attached by a crossbar <b>53</b> to a trigger bar <b>54</b>. The trigger <b>20</b> pivots about a trigger pivot axis and the trigger bar <b>54</b> pivots about a bar pivot axis. Depressing the trigger <b>20</b> actuates the trigger bar <b>54</b> into a rearward position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>, the trigger bar <b>54</b> interferes with rotation of the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> when the trigger <b>20</b> is in the forward rest position. When the trigger <b>20</b> is depressed, the trigger bar <b>54</b> is moved by the crossbar <b>53</b> attached to the trigger <b>20</b> into the rearward position and accordingly, slides into the opening <b>47</b> on the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> and out of interference with one of the knobs <b>49</b> on the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b>. In this position, the trigger bar <b>54</b> interferes with one of the knobs <b>46</b> on the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> thereby preventing further rotation of the first and second circular gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>. When the trigger <b>20</b> is released, the spring-biased tension acting on the trigger <b>20</b> by spring <b>57</b> pulls the trigger <b>20</b> into the forward position and the crossbar <b>53</b> attached to the trigger <b>20</b> forces the trigger bar <b>54</b> forward and out of interference with one of the knobs <b>46</b> on the first circular rotary gear <b>44</b> allowing the first and second circular rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> to rotate. Subsequently, the trigger bar <b>54</b> is again in an interfering position with one of the knobs <b>46</b> on the second circular rotary gear <b>48</b> thereby preventing further rotation of the first and second rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a displacement lever <b>58</b> is secured to the first and second rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>. The displacement lever <b>58</b> rotates with the first and second rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> each time the trigger <b>20</b> is actuated either by pressing or releasing the trigger <b>20</b>. As the displacement lever <b>58</b> rotates, it strikes the rod <b>32</b> of the dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>forcing the retaining hook receiving aperture <b>30</b> in the rod <b>32</b> of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>off of the hook <b>12</b>. The knobs <b>46</b>, <b>49</b> and openings <b>47</b>, <b>50</b> of the first and second circular rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> are of a sufficient size to allow rotation of the displacement lever <b>58</b> a distance that is typically at least about equal to the distance between the hooks <b>12</b> on the outer circumference of the barrel <b>11</b>. Therefore, when the trigger <b>20</b> is depressed or released, the displacement lever <b>58</b> rotates past a single hook <b>12</b>. When one of the hooks <b>12</b> is fully removed from the retaining hook receiving aperture <b>30</b> in the rod <b>32</b> of the foam dart <b>36</b>, the foam dart <b>36</b> is propelled forward utilizing kinetic energy from the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> that is acting on the catch <b>40</b> of the foam dart <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In use, a person releasably secures the catch <b>40</b> of the foam dart <b>36</b> to the mid-point of adjoining inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The person stretches the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> thereby adding energy to the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The person stretches the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> a distance to allow insertion of the hook <b>12</b> that is at least substantially longitudinally aligned with a specific inner and outer elastic band <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The hook <b>12</b> is inserted into retaining hook receiving aperture <b>30</b> in rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Numerous foam darts <b>36</b><i>a </i>may be inserted in this manner. When a predetermined number of darts <b>36</b><i>a </i>have been loaded, the gun <b>10</b> is ready for firing. The person may fire the gun <b>10</b> by either depressing the trigger <b>20</b> or by releasing the trigger <b>20</b>. Each time the trigger <b>20</b> is depressed or released, the displacement lever <b>58</b> rotates with the first and second circular rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>, and actuates rod <b>32</b><i>a </i>such that a single hook <b>12</b> no longer retains the dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>thereby launching the dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>toward a target. As discussed above, the potential energy stored in the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> is converted to kinetic energy, which propels the dart <b>36</b><i>a </i>forward. It is to be understood that a foam dart <b>36</b> could be launched in a similar manner as that described above with respect to the foam dart <b>36</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another embodiment of a foam dart is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>. A foam dart <b>70</b> includes several fins <b>35</b><i>a </i>and a front end <b>38</b> having one of a hook and loop fastening system <b>39</b> such as VELCRO&#xae; which, in a game-playing situation, would attach readily to an opponent's vest that utilizes a complementary component of the hook and loop fastening system <b>39</b>. The foam dart <b>70</b> has a similar construction to foam darts <b>36</b> and <b>36</b><i>a</i>, and it is to be understood that those components of the foam darts <b>36</b>, <b>36</b><i>a</i>, and <b>70</b> the have the same reference numerals are generally the same. A girdle <b>74</b> is connected to an outer circumference of the foam dart <b>70</b> between the front end <b>38</b> and rear end <b>34</b> of the foam dart <b>70</b>. The girdle <b>74</b> is also connected to the front end of a jam stick <b>78</b>. The girdle <b>74</b> or the jam stick <b>78</b> or both include an opening or indentation into which the elastic band assembly clip hook <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B) is inserted. The jam stick <b>78</b> extends parallel with and adjacent to the foam dart <b>70</b> and protrudes beyond the rear end of the foam dart <b>70</b>. A distal end of the jam stick <b>78</b> includes a plurality of laterally extending grooves <b>80</b> or slots or possibly catch material adapted to engage teeth <b>110</b> or catch material on the bottom side <b>112</b> of a jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> as discussed in further detail below. The catch material is a material or substance having a high coefficient of friction, such as rubber. The catch material may be used alone or in conjunction with the laterally extending grooves <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates another embodiment for a foam dart gun. The foam dart gun <b>90</b> has a similar construction to gun <b>10</b> and it is to be understood that those components of the first and second embodiments that have the same reference numerals are generally the same. The first end of gun <b>90</b> includes an alternative design incorporating a different manner of securing and releasing darts <b>70</b> from the gun <b>90</b>. More specifically, gun <b>90</b> is adapted to fire foam darts <b>70</b> by way of a plurality of jam cleat release levers <b>86</b> that are mounted inside a plurality of corresponding channel-shaped mounting brackets <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> illustrate the gun <b>90</b> with the handle <b>18</b> and trigger <b>20</b> assemblies removed. The channel-shaped mounting brackets <b>92</b> house the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> and include a pivot pin <b>94</b> to allow rotation of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b>. Although only one channel-shaped mounting bracket and one jam cleat release lever are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> for ease of illustration and explanation, it should be understood that multiple channel-shaped mounting brackets <b>92</b> and jam cleat release levers <b>86</b> are preferably located around the circumference of the barrel <b>11</b>. The channel-shaped mounting bracket <b>92</b> includes two legs <b>96</b> with outwardly extending flanges <b>98</b> having mounting apertures <b>100</b> for the purpose of mounting the bracket <b>92</b> to the outer circumference of the gun barrel <b>11</b> by mechanical fasteners. A spring assembly <b>102</b> that includes a spring <b>104</b> and spring pin <b>106</b> inside the mounting bracket <b>92</b> acts to bias the bottom of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> into contact with the outer circumference of the barrel <b>11</b>. The outwardly extending flanges <b>98</b> of the mounting bracket legs <b>96</b> are arcuately shaped to correspond with the arcuate shape of the outer circumference of the gun barrel <b>11</b>. The mounting bracket <b>92</b> also includes an enlarged opening <b>108</b>. The enlarged opening <b>108</b> allows a user to mount the jam stick <b>78</b> of the foam dart <b>70</b> into the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> as will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> has a teardrop shape with teeth <b>110</b> on a bottom side <b>112</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> as well as a rounded top surface <b>114</b>. Alternatively, the bottom side <b>112</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> may include a catch material having a high coefficient of friction. The catch material may be used alone or in conjunction with the teeth <b>110</b> on the bottom side <b>112</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b>. The jagged teeth <b>110</b> are designed to engage the lateral grooves <b>80</b> of the jam stick <b>78</b> of the foam dart <b>70</b>. A rearward end of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> has a rounded contact surface <b>116</b> that is adapted for engagement with an engagement portion <b>120</b> of a rotating trigger cam <b>122</b>. The engagement portion <b>120</b> has an inclined contact surface <b>124</b> which is adapted to engage the rounded contact surface <b>116</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b>. The trigger cam <b>122</b> is under constant torsional force that is provided by a torsion spring located inside the barrel <b>11</b>. The trigger cam <b>122</b> of gun <b>90</b> rotates in a manner similar to the displacement lever <b>58</b> of gun <b>10</b> when the trigger <b>20</b> is depressed and released to move trigger bar <b>54</b> into and out of engagement with knobs <b>46</b>, <b>49</b> on the first and second circular rotary gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>, as described in detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the threaded rod <b>125</b> extends outwardly from the back of the gun <b>90</b>. The torsion spring <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a</i>) is secured on one end to the inside of the barrel <b>11</b> and on the other side to the threaded rod <b>125</b>. A spreader <b>128</b><i>a</i>, such as a washer, is inserted over the rod <b>125</b> and first and second mechanical fasteners <b>129</b>, <b>130</b>, such as nuts, are secured on the threaded rod <b>125</b>. A rotatable trigger cam <b>122</b> is included and has a receiving slot <b>132</b> shaped to closely receive at least one of the mechanical fasteners <b>129</b>, <b>130</b>. The threaded rod <b>125</b> extends through the first rotary gear <b>44</b>, a second spreader <b>128</b><i>b </i>(such as washer), and a second circular rotary gear <b>48</b>. The trigger cam <b>122</b>, first rotary gear <b>44</b>, second spreader <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and second rotary gear <b>48</b>, are held in place by a third spreader <b>128</b><i>c </i>(such as a washer) and third mechanical fastener <b>140</b>, such as a nut. As the trigger <b>20</b> of the gun <b>90</b> is depressed or released, the trigger cam <b>122</b>, which is connected to the first and second gears <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>, rotates by way of the torsional spring force applied by the torsion spring <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>). As the trigger cam <b>122</b> rotates, the engagement portion <b>120</b> on the trigger cam <b>122</b> rotates into contact with the rounded contact surface <b>116</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>). As the engagement portion <b>120</b> strikes the rounded contact surface <b>116</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b>, the rounded contact surface <b>116</b> is lifted, raising the teeth <b>110</b> or catch material or both (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>). The force related to the rotation of the trigger cam <b>122</b> is great enough to overcome the opposing contact force supplied by the spring assembly <b>102</b> and by the elastic bands <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>15</b>&#x2032; which pull the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> into frictional engagement with the jam stick <b>78</b> of the foam dart <b>70</b>. As the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> is raised by the rotating trigger cam <b>122</b>, the teeth <b>110</b> and/or catch material of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> separate from the grooves <b>80</b> and/or catch material of the jam stick <b>78</b> and the dart <b>70</b> is released and launched.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, to reload, a user engages the slot <b>35</b><i>b </i>of the dart <b>70</b> with the catch <b>31</b> or <b>31</b>&#x2032; secured to the mid-points of the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. When the dart <b>70</b> is securely engaged with the catch <b>31</b> or <b>31</b>&#x2032;, the dart <b>70</b> is pulled back toward the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b>. The user then inserts the jam stick <b>78</b> of the foam dart <b>70</b> into the enlarged opening of the jam cleat mounting bracket <b>92</b> until the rear end of the dart <b>70</b> touches the mounting bracket <b>92</b>. As the user lets go, the spring force acting on the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> rotates the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> downward into frictional engagement with the jam stick <b>78</b>. The laterally extending grooves <b>80</b> of the jam stick <b>78</b> interface with the teeth <b>110</b> of the jam cleat release lever <b>86</b> to hold the foam dart <b>70</b> in place. Note that the foam dart <b>70</b> should be secured in a complimentary mounting bracket <b>92</b> that lines up with the inner and outer elastic bands <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> to which the foam dart <b>70</b> is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref> illustrate a quick release trigger cam system <b>135</b>. The quick release trigger cam system <b>135</b> includes a threaded bolt that extends into the barrel of the gun and is attached to the torsion spring inside the barrel. The torsion spring <b>51</b> is secured on one end to the inside of the barrel <b>11</b> and on the other side to the threaded rod <b>125</b>. The threaded rod <b>125</b> extends outwardly from the back of the gun <b>90</b>. A spreader <b>128</b>, such as a washer, is inserted over the rod <b>125</b> and first and second mechanical fasteners <b>129</b>, <b>130</b>, such as nuts, are secured on the threaded rod <b>125</b>. A rotatable trigger cam <b>122</b> is included and has a receiving slot <b>132</b> shaped to closely receive at least one of the mechanical fasteners <b>129</b>, <b>130</b>. The threaded rod <b>125</b> extends through the first rotary gear <b>44</b>, a second spreader <b>128</b><i>b</i>, second circular rotary gear <b>48</b>, and a compression spring <b>136</b>. The trigger cam <b>122</b>, first rotary gear <b>44</b>, second spreader <b>128</b><i>b</i>, second rotary gear <b>48</b>, and the compression spring <b>136</b> are held in place by a third spreader <b>128</b><i>c </i>and third mechanical fastener <b>140</b>. To increase the torque acting on the trigger cam <b>122</b> by the torsion spring <b>51</b>, the quick release trigger cam system <b>135</b> must be wound against the torsional force of the torsion spring <b>51</b>. The quick release trigger cam system <b>135</b> design allows the user to pull the rotatable trigger cam <b>122</b> away from the trigger bar <b>54</b> against the force of the compression spring <b>136</b> and easily rewind the trigger cam <b>122</b> without having to hold the trigger bar <b>54</b> out of the way. This lessens the time it takes to restore torque in the torsion spring <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An alternative embodiment of a gun is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. A gun <b>160</b> has a corrugated barrel <b>161</b> with an adapter sleeve <b>162</b>. The corrugated barrel <b>161</b> includes a corrugated circumference having multiple elongate channel sections <b>164</b>. The width of each channel section <b>164</b> is equal to or larger than the foam dart <b>70</b> and provides a path for the dart <b>70</b> to follow when being propelled, or launched, by the first and second elastic bands <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>15</b>&#x2032;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, near the distal end of the barrel <b>161</b>, the elastomeric member receiving aperture <b>24</b> is approximately centrally located in each corrugation, or channel, with outwardly extending grooves <b>25</b> projecting outwardly therefrom. The inner and outer elastic band ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>are pinched and slid through the outwardly extending grooves <b>25</b> until the bulbous end <b>26</b> is retained in the retaining apertures <b>28</b> on the interior surface of the barrel <b>11</b>. With this design, the corrugations assist in directing the foam dart down the longitudinal extent of the channel sections along the barrel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, the adapter sleeve <b>162</b> is located at the barrel <b>161</b> and includes a circular outside perimeter <b>166</b> and a corrugated interior perimeter <b>168</b>. The corrugated interior perimeter <b>168</b> of the adapter sleeve <b>162</b> is complementary with the outside corrugated perimeter <b>166</b> of the barrel <b>161</b>.
