<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a &#xa7;371 national stage filing of PCT International Application No. PCT/GB2006/002871, filed on Aug. 1, 2006 and published in English on Feb. 8, 2007 as WO 2007/015085, which claims priority from British application number GB 0515783.9, filed on Aug. 1, 2005. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a plug for insertion into an end of a duct to provide a sealed closure for the duct. More particularly, the invention provides a plug for inserting into an end of a duct used to carry fibre-optics cables.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fibre-optics cables are in wide-spread use for carrying telecommunications signals. A number of methods commonly used to create fibre optics telecommunications networks involve first establishing a network of ducts between required locations and then introducing the fibre optics cables into the network of ducts using techniques such as the &#x201c;blown fibre&#x201d; and &#x201c;blown cable&#x201d; methods. These methods involve driving the fibre optic cable along the duct with compressed air, for example as described in EP 0108590 (British Telecommunications). In order for such methods to work efficiently, it is desirable that the network of ducts should be sufficiently gas-tight to enable maintenance of the gas pressures needed to convey the cables along the ducts. For this reason, open ends of ducts at terminal locations on the network are typically fitted with plugs (end-stops) that have seals to prevent or limit the escape of gas. The end-stops also serve to prevent foreign objects or materials (e.g. dust and small creatures) from passing into the network.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an improved end-stop for a cable duct.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides a plug for sealing an end of a duct; the plug comprising a sealing member for sealing against an interior surface of the duct; and gripping means comprising one or more teeth for gripping the interior surface of the duct; the plug having a pair of opposed camming surfaces arranged for relative axial movement therebetween whereby the relative axial movement results in the teeth of the gripping means being urged radially outwardly into gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The duct is typically a duct of the type used for carrying fibre-optics communications cables, and more preferably ducts used in the constructions of blown fibre installations. The duct, which is typically formed from a plastics material, usually has a circular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The term &#x201c;gripping&#x201d; as used herein refers to an action in which a gripping element or member digs, bites or impresses into a surface. It is not intended to cover a mere frictional engagement with the interior surface of the type that might be encountered with, for example, an elastomeric seal. The gripping member is therefore provided with one or more gripping teeth, the term &#x201c;teeth&#x201d; as used herein referring to a structure having a point, edge, ridge or protuberance that can cut into or impress the interior wall of the duct to anchor the teeth in the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The gripping means may be present on a main body portion of the plug, or on a separate gripping member, or on both.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The opposed camming surfaces are present on two separate components of the plug, the two components being arrangement for relative axial movement therebetween. Although both of the camming surfaces may be movable, more usually one of the camming surfaces is fixed and the other is movable. The camming surfaces may each be inclined relative to the axis of the plug. Alternatively, only one of the camming surfaces may be inclined, the other surface functioning as a cam follower. In one embodiment, both of the camming surfaces are substantially frustoconical in shape, one of the surfaces being radially inwardly facing and the other of the surfaces being radially outwardly facing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sealing member is typically an annular seal formed from an elastomeric material. The sealing member may take various forms. In one form, the sealing member comprises one or more &#x201c;O-rings&#x201d;, more typically only a single &#x201c;O-ring&#x201d;. In another form, the sealing member is cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The plug may have a main body portion in the form of a shaft for insertion into the end of the duct, and a head portion connected to the shaft which head portion, in use, protrudes from the end of the duct. Relative axial movement of the two opposed camming surfaces is preferably brought about by axial movement of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The sealing member may be positioned at or adjacent an axially innermost end of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the shaft has an enlarged inner end portion, the enlarged inner end portion having an annular groove in the radially outer surface thereof in which is mounted a sealing member such as an O-ring.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the shaft is provided with a pair of axially spaced apart compression members each extending radially outwardly from the shaft, one of the compression members being fixed relative to the shaft and the other being slidable with respect to the shaft; a sealing member (e.g. of cylindrical form) being mounted about the shaft between the two compression members so that axial movement of the shaft compresses the sealing member between the two compression members to deform the sealing member into sealing contact with the interior wall of the duct. Typically the axially innermost of the two compression members is fixed with respect to the shaft and the axially outermost compression member, i.e. the compression member nearest the end of the duct, is slidable with respect to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The shaft can be provided with a camming surface by virtue of the profile of the shaft itself; i.e. the camming surface is integrally formed; or the shaft may have a camming member mounted thereon. The camming member may be movably (e.g. slidably) mounted on the shaft, or it may fixedly mounted on the shaft, for example by adhesive bonding, welding, fusion, friction fit or a snap fit, for example. The camming member may, for example, have a frustoconical camming surface. In one embodiment, the camming member also functions as a compression member as hereinbefore defined, one surface of the camming member functioning as a camming surface and another surface of the camming member serving as a compression surface for compressing the sealing member. The compression surface may be inclined relative to the axis of the shaft or substantially perpendicular thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The gripping member may be concentrically arranged about the shaft or it may be eccentrically arranged with respect to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the gripping member takes the form of a gripping collar or collet which encircles the shaft, the collet having a radially inwardly facing camming surface and a radially outwardly facing gripping surface, whereby axial movement of the shaft urges a camming surface of the camming member against the camming surface on the collet thereby to force the gripping surface of the collet outwardly and into gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The axial movement of the shaft can be brought about by means of a threaded connection between two components of the plug, or by means of a plunger mechanism. For example, a screw cap or collar can be mounted on an external end (e.g. head portion) of the shaft, rotation of the screw cap or collar serving to bring about the axial movement.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The complementary camming surfaces may be configured such that the gripping member is urged into gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct as the shaft is moved in a direction towards the end of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, the complementary camming surfaces may be configured such that the gripping member is urged into gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct as the shaft is moved in a direction away from the end of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one particular embodiment, the shaft has a head portion extending axially outwardly from the end of the duct, and a screw collar mounted on the head portion, rotation of the screw collar serving to being about axial movement of the shaft in a direction towards the end of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As an alternative to a screw collar mechanism, the shaft may take the form of a plunger which is pushed into the duct, the axial motion of the shaft as it is pushed into the duct serving to bring the two camming surfaces together so that the gripping teeth of the gripping means are urged radially outwardly into gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct. In this embodiment, a camming member may be aligned alongside the shaft inside the duct. The camming member may be offset from the axis of the plug and may, in use, contact the wall of the duct over a proportion of its circumference. The camming member may be provided with one or more gripping teeth and thereby may constitute all or part of the gripping means. Alternatively, the camming member may have no teeth and thus does not function as a gripping member&#x2014;which case, one or more teeth associated with or present on the shaft may constitute the gripping means. Preferably, however, both the shaft and the camming member are provided with one or more teeth. In this embodiment, confronting surfaces of the camming member and shaft may be configured to provide a ratchet mechanism whereby the shaft can be moved from a first position, in which the gripping means does not exert a gripping effect, to a second position, in which the camming surfaces engage to urge the gripping teeth into gripping contact with the interior surface of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The plug is preferably provided with means for visually indicating when the plug is in a gripping configuration and when the plug is in a non-gripping configuration. Such means can take the form of, for example, one or more edges or surfaces on a pair of relatively movable parts of the plug that move into alignment when the plug is in one (i.e. gripping or non-gripping) configuration and out of alignment when the plug is in an opposite configuration.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The invention will now be illustrated, but not limited, by reference to the specific embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> show a plug according to one embodiment of the invention for inserting into an end of a conduit duct of the type used in fibre optics cable assemblies. The duct <b>2</b> is typically formed from a flexible plastics material and will usually have a smooth interior surface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A plug according to the invention, generally designated by the numeral <b>6</b>, is inserted into the end of the duct. The plug <b>6</b> has a shaft <b>8</b> which has a piston portion <b>10</b> at its innermost end, the piston portion <b>10</b> having an annular recess for accommodating an O-ring sealing member <b>12</b>. The outermost end of the shaft <b>8</b> has a mushroom-shaped portion <b>14</b>. The shaft <b>8</b> also has one or more gripping teeth <b>16</b> (only one is shown for simplicity) and a camming portion <b>18</b> with an angled camming surface <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also disposed within the end of the duct is a camming member <b>22</b>, which sits alongside the shaft <b>8</b>. The camming member has an outermost portion <b>24</b> which is of a size to sit within the slot in the mushroom-shaped portion <b>14</b> of the shaft. The outermost portion <b>24</b> has a radially extending edge <b>26</b> that acts as a stop and prevents the camming member <b>22</b> from being moved further into the duct. The gripping member has a saw-tooth shaped recess <b>28</b> which, in the non-gripping position, receives the camming portion <b>18</b> of the shaft. A second shallower saw tooth recess <b>30</b> in the surface of the camming member <b>22</b> is provided further along the camming member. The outer surface of the camming member <b>22</b> has one or more teeth <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tooth <b>32</b> is shown as being in contact with the interior surface <b>4</b> of the duct but at this stage does not bite into the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a seal is created between the O-ring <b>12</b> and the interior surface <b>4</b> of the duct, but the teeth on the camming member <b>22</b> and the teeth <b>16</b> on the shaft only lightly grip the surface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shaft <b>8</b> acts as a plunger, such that, when the mushroom-shaped portion <b>14</b> is pushed into the duct, the shaft moves whereby the camming surface <b>20</b> of the camming portion <b>18</b> cams along the complimentary camming surface of the saw-tooth recess <b>28</b>. This has two effects. Firstly, it forces the shaft <b>8</b> outwardly (downwardly in the drawing) so that the tooth <b>16</b> bites into the interior surface <b>4</b> of the duct. Secondly, the camming member <b>22</b> is forced outwardly so that the tooth <b>32</b> is urged into gripping engagement with the interior surface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shaft <b>8</b> is pushed along the duct until the camming portion <b>18</b> snaps into the shallower saw-tooth recess <b>30</b>. At this point, the plug is firmly locked in place. The angle of the teeth is such that any attempt to remove the plug results in the teeth gripping the interior surface even more tightly. The shaft and camming member thus form a ratchet mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will also be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that in the fully sealed gripping position, the outer curved surface of the outermost portion <b>24</b> of the camming member is flush with the curved outer surface of the mushroom-shaped portion <b>14</b> of the shaft, thereby providing a visual indication that the plug has been correctly installed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The plug according to a second embodiment of the intervention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In this embodiment, the plug <b>102</b> comprises a shaft portion <b>104</b>, having an outermost head portion <b>108</b> which bears an external thread <b>103</b>. The innermost end of the shaft <b>104</b> has an amular groove <b>110</b> in which is seated a washer <b>112</b>. The washer <b>112</b> is held in place by means of retaining washer or circlip <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A collet <b>116</b> sits inside the mouth of the duct, a flange <b>118</b> of the collet resting against the end surface of the duct and preventing the collet from being pushed into the duct. The collet has a gripping portion comprising teeth <b>120</b>, the radially inner surface of the gripping portion being inclined so that it forms a camming surface <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Positioned between the collett <b>116</b> and the washer <b>112</b> are a sealing member <b>124</b> and a frustoconical washer <b>126</b> which functions both as a camming member and a compression member as will be apparent from the description below. Frustoconical washer <b>126</b> has an inclined camming surface <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sealing member <b>124</b> is in only light sealing engagement with the interior surface <b>4</b> of the duct <b>2</b>, whilst the teeth <b>120</b> are not fully engaged with the surface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A screw cap <b>130</b> is located on the threaded outer portion <b>108</b> of the shaft <b>104</b>. The cap <b>130</b> has an annular recess <b>132</b> in which is seated the domed end <b>134</b> of the shaft. In the relaxed non-gripping position, the domed end <b>134</b> is recessed with respect to the end <b>138</b> of the cap <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to tighten the plug and bring the collet teeth <b>120</b> into biting engagement with the surface <b>4</b> of the duct, the end cap <b>130</b> is rotated (either clockwise or anti clockwise depending upon the direction of the thread) so that the shaft <b>104</b> is moved in a direction towards the end of the duct. As it moves, the washer <b>112</b> compresses the sealing member <b>124</b> against the surface <b>136</b> of washer <b>126</b>, thereby squashing the sealing member against the surface <b>4</b> to provide a fluid tight seal. At the same time, the inclined camming surface <b>128</b> of the frustoconical washer <b>126</b> is urged against the camming surface <b>122</b> of the collet, which causes the gripping portion <b>120</b> of the collet to move radially outwardly, so that the teeth bite into the surface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the shaft <b>104</b> moves towards the end of the duct, the domed surface <b>134</b> moves to a position where it is flush with the curved surface <b>138</b> at the end of the cap <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This provides a visual indicator that the plug is in tight gripping engagement with the interior surface of the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A major benefit of this design is that increased fluid pressures within the duct, which might otherwise force the plug out of the end of the duct, merely serve to cause the teeth of the collet <b>120</b> to dig into the duct more tightly. Consequently, the plug of the invention is capable of resisting high internal fluid pressures without being ejected. Plugs of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are particularly suitable for use with wider bore fibre optics ducts, for examples ducts having a nominal internal diameter of up to 10 mm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The plugs described above in relation to the drawings are given as examples of plugs in accordance with the invention. It will readily be apparent that numerous modifications and alterations may be made to the plugs illustrated in the drawings without departing from the principles underlying this invention and all such modifications and alterations are intended to be embraced by this application.</p>
