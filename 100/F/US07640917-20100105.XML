<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fuel injector tip seal is provided including improved resistance to the heat and pressures of combustion gas. According to one aspect, the tip seal is formed from polytetrafluoroethylene and between 10 and 35 percent carbon fiber. The material offers improved surface finish and deformation resistance as well as improved thermal conduction and keeps thermal expansion low as compared to conventional fuel injector tip seal designs. According to a further aspect, a revised seal groove design is provided that allows for expansion and deformation of the tip seal and creates more pressure to the outside diameter face when pressure is applied at the tip. According to another aspect, the tip seal is formed of a flat disk-shaped seal body that can be assembled on the fuel injector by an assembly cone device that allows the disk-shaped seal body to be flipped to a ring-shaped configuration in its assembled position.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to gas direct injector tip seals and more particularly, to injector tip seals that are subjected to combustion gasses.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fuel injector tip seals are commonly provided at the interface between the fuel injector and an aperture in the head of the engine through which the fuel injector extends for injecting fuel directly into the cylinders of the engine. The fuel injector tip seals are subjected to compression temperatures and pressure which create design concerns relating to the life span of the seals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides fuel injector tip seal designs that are intended to improve the durability of the tip seal. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a tip seal is provided including a ring-shaped body formed of polytetrafluoroethylene that includes between 10 and 35 percent carbon. The carbon filled PTFE provides improved surface finish and deformation resistance and improved thermal conduction and reduced thermal expansion, as compared to current injector tip seals which use approximately 20 percent glass bead filled PTFE or 25 percent glass fiber filled PTFE.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the fuel injector assembly is provided with an elongated injector body having a fuel passage extending therethrough and terminating at a tip thereof. The injector body includes a recessed groove in an outer diameter thereof having a first radially extending end wall and a second radially extending end wall spaced from the first end wall by a first distance. The first end wall is disposed in closer proximity to the tip than the second end wall and a continuously sloped axially extending recessed base wall surface extends from the first end wall to the second end wall such that a first end of the continuously sloped axially extending surface adjacent to the first wall has a smaller diameter than a second end of said continuously sloped axially extending surface adjacent to said second end wall. A ring-shaped seal body is disposed in the recessed groove. The slope of the base wall of the groove creates more pressure to the outside diameter face of the seal body when pressure is applied at the tip. The groove diameter is provided so that an increased axial clearance is provided between the end walls of the groove and the end walls of the ring-shaped seal body to allow for PTFE expansion and deformation at increased temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, a fuel injector tip seal is provided including a seal body having an uninstalled flat disk-shape with a pair of sidewalls having an aperture centrally located therein and a radial dimension extending radially from said central aperture to an outer periphery. The seal body is inserted in a recessed groove in the injector body with the pair of sidewalls being flipped so as to be disposed such that the radial dimension of the pair of sidewalls extend axially relative to the elongated injector body. A cone-shaped assembly tool can be utilized to assist in sliding the seal body onto the fuel injector body and into the recessed groove. The disk-shaped seal body provides a significant reduction in cost for both material and labor by eliminating the machining that is required for conventional seal designs.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, a fuel injector assembly <b>10</b> incorporating a tip seal <b>12</b>, according to the principles of the present disclosure, will now be described. The fuel injector assembly <b>10</b> includes an elongated injector body <b>14</b> having a fuel passage <b>16</b> extending therethrough and terminating at a tip <b>18</b> thereof. The injector body <b>14</b> includes a recessed groove <b>20</b> in an outer diameter thereof. The tip seal <b>12</b> includes a ring shaped seal body <b>22</b> formed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and including between 20 and 35 percent graphitized carbon, and more preferably, approximately 25 percent graphitized carbon. As compared to current tip seal designs that utilized approximately 20 percent glass bead filled PTFE or approximately 25 percent fiber filled PTFE, the tip seal <b>12</b> of the present disclosure having graphitized carbon filled PTFE offers improved thermal conduction (from 0.3 W/m*K to 0.68 W/m*K) and keeps thermal expansion low, thereby providing improved tip seal durability with improved finish and deformation resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a fuel injector assembly <b>110</b> is shown including an elongated injector body <b>112</b> having a fuel passage <b>114</b> extending therethrough and terminating at a tip <b>116</b> thereof. The injector body includes a recessed groove <b>118</b> in an outer diameter thereof. The recessed groove <b>118</b> has a first radially extending end wall <b>120</b> and a second radially extending end wall <b>122</b> spaced from the first end wall by a distance D. The first end wall <b>120</b> is disposed in closer proximity to the tip <b>116</b> than the second end wall <b>122</b>. A continuously sloped axially extending base wall surface <b>124</b> extends from the first end wall <b>120</b> to the second end wall <b>122</b> such that a first end of the continuously sloped axially extending base wall surface, adjacent to the first end wall has a smaller diameter than a second end of said continuously sloped axially extending surface adjacent to the second end wall <b>122</b>, thus, the continuously sloped axially extending surface had a generally conical shape. A ring-shaped seal body <b>130</b> is disposed in the recessed groove <b>118</b>. The seal body <b>130</b> can be made from PTFE and can be filled with graphitized carbon or known fillers such as glass fiber and glass beads. The ring-shaped seal body <b>130</b> has an axial width W that is smaller than the distance D between the first and second end walls <b>120</b>,<b>122</b> of the recessed groove <b>118</b> such that an axial clearance is provided to allow for PTFE expansion and deformation at increased temperatures. The axial clearance allows gas to flow in to the cavity between the seal and side wall of the groove. The axial clearance between the end walls <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and the ends of the seal body should be sufficient to accommodate for the PTFE expansion and deformation without providing unnecessary stresses or strains on the seal body. The continuously sloped base wall surface <b>124</b> creates pressure to the outside diameter face of the seal body when pressure is applied at the tip <b>116</b> of the fuel injector <b>112</b>, thus enhancing the sealing capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a still further embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an elongated injector body <b>212</b> is shown and includes a fuel passage extending therethrough and terminating at a tip <b>214</b> thereof. The injector body includes a recessed groove <b>216</b> in an outer diameter thereof. A seal body <b>220</b> having an uninstalled flat disk shape is illustrated at a rightward position within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The seal body <b>220</b> has a circular shape with a pair of sidewalls <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> having an aperture <b>226</b> centrally located therein and a radial dimension &#x201c;R&#x201d; extending radially from the central aperture <b>226</b> to an outer periphery <b>230</b> of the circular seal body <b>220</b>. The seal body <b>220</b> is inserted in the recessed groove <b>216</b> of the injector body <b>212</b> with the pair of sidewalls <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> being &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; so as to be disposed such that the radial dimension R of the pair of sidewalls extends axially relative to the elongated injector body <b>212</b>. Thus, in the installed position within the recessed groove <b>216</b> of the injector body <b>212</b>, the seal body <b>220</b>&#x2032; is deformed such that the surface forming the central aperture <b>226</b> and the surface forming the outer periphery <b>230</b> now form the axial ends <b>226</b>&#x2032;, <b>230</b>&#x2032; of the deformed seal body <b>220</b>&#x2032;. Furthermore, the sidewalls <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the uninstalled seal body <b>220</b> now form the inside diameter wall <b>222</b>&#x2032; and outside diameter wall <b>224</b>&#x2032; of the installed seal body <b>220</b>&#x2032;. An installation tool <b>240</b> can be utilized for installing the seal body <b>220</b> onto the injector body <b>212</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The cone-shaped installation tool <b>240</b> can be disposed against the tip <b>214</b> of the injector body <b>212</b> and the disk-shaped seal body <b>220</b> is slid up the cone-shaped surface <b>242</b> of the tool <b>240</b> until the seal body <b>220</b> slides off the end <b>244</b> of the tool <b>240</b> and into the recessed groove <b>216</b> on the injector body <b>212</b>. With this design, a significant reduction in cost for both material and labor is achieved since no machining of the seal body is required and installation of the seal onto the tip is simplified.</p>
