<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A stock interface can be slipped onto and attached to a standard CAR buffer tube. The stock interface provides structures for attaching a butt stock and stock interface attachments such as an ergonomic attachment, a container attachment, and a power attachment. Small arms ergonomics can be improved by providing a better cheek weld via an ergonomic attachment. Container attachments provide storage. Power attachments provide electrical power for items such as electronic sighting systems, lasers, lights, or any of the other electronic devices attached to a small arm.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims the priority and benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/833,712 filed on Jul. 27, 2006 entitled &#x201c;Stock Interface&#x201d; and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments relate to fields of small arms, rifle stocks, and modular rifle stocks. Embodiments also relate to the fields of power sources and electrical interconnections.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Small arms design has moved past using fixed stock elements to using adjustable or modular components. Adjustable or modular components are used to configure a firearm for specific uses or missions. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,348,328 issued to Roy discloses an adjustable stock for use in conjunction with a CAR buffer tube. A buffer tube is a tube mounted to the back of a firearm receiver. In most applications, when the firearm is discharged, the bolt travels back and into the buffer tube while a spring, called the buffer spring, supplies a force for decelerating the bolt and returning it to a forward position. FIG. 1B of U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,005 illustrates a spring in a buffer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Roy, however, uses a specially formed CAR buffer tube for use with his adjustable stock. Many buffer tubes are simply cylinders that are appropriately sized for holding a buffer spring and decelerating the bolt. The CAR buffer tube is a buffer tube with an elongated rib and a groove. The CAR buffer tube is a standard part of certain military issue small arms. U.S. Pat. No. 3,348,328 contains illustrations of a CAR buffer tube, a stock element that slides onto the CAR buffer tube, and a locking mechanism that can lock the sliding stock in a variety of positions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Standard CAR buffer tubes, such as those used with the M4 and M16 carbines, have been attached to shotgun receivers. Some shotguns equipped with CAR buffer tubes do not use a buffer spring within the CAR buffer tube to achieve semiautomatic operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a side view of an idealized CAR buffer tube. A cylindrical tube <b>1101</b> has a threaded end <b>1102</b> for attachment to a receiver and an elongated rib <b>1103</b> extending radially.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a bottom view of an idealized CAR buffer tube. The groove <b>1201</b> in the elongated rib <b>1103</b> can be seen. Holes <b>1202</b> are positioned in the undercut groove <b>1201</b>. An adjustable stock can be locked into position by a pin pressing into a hole <b>1202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a cut view of an idealized CAR buffer tube. The cylindrical tube <b>1101</b> has a sidewall <b>1302</b> and an opening <b>1301</b> that can contain a buffer spring. The groove <b>1201</b> in the elongated rib <b>1103</b> can be seen.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other inventors have refined Roy's adjustable length butt stock. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,874,267, U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,371, disclose modular gunstock systems. Like Roy, these two inventions use a specially designed replacement buffer tube. An armorer trained to work on small arms replaces the original buffer tube with the replacement buffer tube. Users who are less specialized than the armorer can then configure the remainder of the modular gunstock system. Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,925,744 that refines Roy's adjustable length butt stock by adding compartment modules to the moveable butt stock element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a stylized toy replica <b>1401</b> firing a pellet <b>1402</b>. Many toy replicas, such as Airsoft toys, are pellet firing small arms replicas. Hobbyists enjoy engaging in mock non-lethal battles using toy replicas because they are realistic looking and fire non lethal, although often painful, pellets. Realistic toys are also used in small arms training because the toys can have the same weight, size, and accessories as firearms used in combat or police work. The toy replicas are often realistic enough that many after market accessories can be used with both small arms and with toy replicas. A toy replica of an AR16 or M4 carbine, however, uses an imitation CAR buffer tube <b>1403</b> and not a real CAR buffer tube. As such, a small arms accessory requiring replacement of the buffer tube is not suitable for use with a toy replica. The illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is stylized because, from a distance, a toy replica can be indistinguishable from an actual small arm. Those practiced in combat training and police training are familiar with toy replicas.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a firearm <b>1701</b>. More specifically, the firearm is an M16 rifle or its' civilian counterpart the AR15. The M16 <b>1701</b> buffer tube is a cylindrical buffer tube inside the stock <b>1702</b>. The buffer tube is threaded to the lower receiver <b>1703</b> on one end and has a threaded hole in the other end. A bolt threaded into the threaded hole bolts the stock <b>1702</b> to the buffer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, labeled as &#x201c;prior art&#x201d;, illustrates a firearm <b>1801</b> with an exposed buffer tube <b>1802</b>. The firearm is an M16 rifle as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The butt stock is removed so that the buffer tube <b>1802</b> can be seen. A bolt <b>1803</b> such as that for bolting on the stock, is threaded into the threaded hole at the end of the buffer tube <b>1802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Prior art systems, however, require trained armorers or lack a comfortable cheek weld for a marksman. As such, systems and methods are needed to address shortcomings in the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the embodiments and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Systems and methods providing an easily installable and configurable modular gunstock are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is therefore an aspect of the embodiments to provide a stock interface and at least one fastener. The stock interface is specifically designed to slide over a CAR buffer tube. A fastener can exploit the undercut groove to fasten the stock attachment to the CAR buffer tube. For example, a properly sized nut can be positioned in the CAR buffer tube's groove so that a bolt can be inserted through the stock interface and threaded into the nut. Tightening the bolt fastens the stock interface to the CAR buffer tube in a fixed position. The stock interface can be provisioned for mounting stock interface attachments such as ergonomic attachments, container attachments, and power attachments.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Stock interface attachments can be attached to a stock interface using dovetails, interlocking fingers, or threaded hard points. Captured dovetails and interlocking fingers allow the parts to be slid together or otherwise snapped into place. As such, most infantrymen have the requisite skill to configure or customize a firearm. A threaded hard point can also be used where a threaded part is inserted into the threaded hard point to fasten the stock interface attachment to the stock interface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An ergonomic attachment is designed to improve a marksman's or an infantryman's ability to use a firearm. Standard issue AR16 or M4 carbines have an adjustable stock on a CAR buffer tube. Accurate long distance shooting requires a comfortable and consistent cheek weld between the shooters face and the firearm. The CAR buffer tube, however, is positioned for producing a cheek weld but does not provide a comfortable or consistent cheek weld. A good cheek weld can be obtained by attaching a stock interface to the CAR buffer tube. A better one can be obtained by attaching an ergonomic attachment to the stock interface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A container attachment is a stock interface attachment containing a compartment that can hold items such as batteries, coins, rocks, or whatever else an infantryman can fit into the compartment. A container attachment can have multiple containers. Small container attachment can be attached side by side to the stock interface to provide multiple compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A power attachment is a stock interface attachment that provides electrical power through an electrical interconnect. The power source can be replaceable or a permanent part of the power attachment. For example, a power attachment can have a battery compartment for disposable batteries. Alternatively, a power attachment can permanently contain a fuel cell and, perhaps, a refillable fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An electrical interconnect provides a way to get electrical energy into or out of a stock interface attachment. Electrodes that produce an electrical contact when attached to the stock interface can be used. A plug and socket type electrical interconnect can be used such that power is supplied when the plug is connected to the socket. An inductive interconnect can be used where inductive coupling is used to transmit power while keeping the electrical components sealed away from harm.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A stock can be attached to a mounting rail on the underside of the stock interface. For example, a Picatinny (M-1913) type mounting rail can be used. Picatinny rails and mounting hardware are well known to those practiced in small arms. As such, a stock with a Picatinny mounting configuration can be reliably and repeatedly attached to a Picatinny type mounting rail. Other types of rail can be equivalently used although the Picatinny is prevalent in many applications and markets.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a stock interface <b>101</b> and stock interface attachments <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The stock interface <b>101</b> is designed to slip over a CAR buffer tube. An ergonomic attachment <b>102</b> and a container attachment <b>103</b> are designed to attach to the stock interface. Notice that symmetry allows the stock interface attachments <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> to be attached on either the left or right side. Dovetails <b>104</b> running longitudinally along the stock interface <b>101</b> are designed to mate with matching dovetails <b>105</b> on the stock interface attachments. A longitudinally running mounting rail <b>106</b> can be used for attaching a stock. Items can be stored in the container interior <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The particular shape of the illustrated dovetails <b>104</b> and matching dovetails <b>105</b> form what is known as a captured dovetail. Items using captured dovetails are connected by first aligning the dovetails and then sliding the items into position along the dovetails. Alternatively, a snapping dovetail allows the items to be aligned and pressed together such that the items flex and the dovetails snap together.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a stock interface <b>101</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The dovetails <b>104</b> and mounting rail <b>106</b> can be seen. The shape of the central opening <b>201</b> is seen to match the shape of a CAR buffer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a stock interface <b>101</b> and container attachments <b>103</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The dovetails <b>104</b> and matching dovetails <b>105</b> are designed such that the container attachments <b>103</b> snap onto the stock interface <b>101</b>. Adhesives or threaded fasteners are not necessary but can be used to ensure robust attachment. A threaded fastener can be passed through a hole in a stock interface attachment and into a threaded hard point on the stock interface <b>101</b>. The container attachments <b>103</b> can be sealed with a plug or a cork. The container attachments <b>103</b> can be produced with one end permanently sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a stock interface <b>101</b> and ergonomic attachments <b>102</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The dovetails <b>104</b> and matching dovetails <b>105</b> are designed such that the ergonomic attachments <b>102</b> snap onto the stock interface <b>101</b>. Adhesives or threaded fasteners are not necessary but can be used to ensure robust attachment. The ergonomic attachments <b>102</b> can produce, when attached to the stock interface <b>101</b>, a smooth profile suitable for a good cheek weld as required by most marksmen.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a stylized stock <b>501</b> attached to the stock interface <b>101</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The stock <b>501</b> illustrated is an under sliding butt stock that can be slid along the mounting rail <b>106</b> and be firmly attached in a desired position. A spring can press a pin <b>502</b> in the stock <b>501</b> against the rail <b>106</b> to fix the stock in place. A lever <b>503</b> can be used to pull the pin <b>502</b> away from the rail <b>106</b> to free the stock <b>501</b>. The under sliding butt stock <b>501</b> can be fixed in place even more firmly when the pin <b>502</b> slides into a hole on the under side of the mounting rail <b>106</b>. Alternatively, a fixed length stock can be attached to the mounting rail <b>106</b>. The fixed length stock can be slipped onto the mounting rail <b>106</b> and pressed fully forward. Pins, adhesives, fasteners, tape, hook-and-loop, or interlocking fingers, or other means can be used for securing either adjustable or permanent length stocks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates two container attachments <b>602</b> that can be mounted side by side in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. A stock interface <b>601</b> has a first and second container attachment <b>602</b> mounted side by side.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a power attachment <b>701</b> with an electrical power compartment <b>707</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The electrical power compartment <b>707</b> is illustrated as containing replaceable batteries <b>702</b>, a negative electrode <b>705</b>, a conductive spring <b>703</b>, and a positive electrode <b>704</b>. An electrical interconnect <b>706</b> is electrically attached to the positive electrode <b>704</b> and, by way of a wire <b>708</b>, to the negative electrode <b>705</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a high level block diagram of a power attachment <b>801</b> with a fuel cell <b>802</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. A fuel tank <b>803</b> provides fuel to the fuel cell. Those practiced in the art of fuel cells are familiar with fuel cells and the fuels that can be used to power them. An electrical interconnect <b>804</b> can be used for passing electrical energy into and out of the power attachment. Those skilled in electrical equipment or electronic systems are familiar with many types of electrical interconnects including electrodes, plug and socket, card edge connectors, inductive couplers, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a high level block diagram of a power attachment <b>901</b> with permanent batteries <b>902</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. Permanent batteries <b>902</b> are a permanent part of the power attachment <b>901</b>. As such, the entire power attachment <b>901</b> is replaced when the permanent batteries <b>902</b> are depleted. Permanent batteries, replaceable batteries, and fuel cells are different types of electrical power source.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a cut view of a stock interface <b>101</b> fixedly attached to a CAR buffer tube in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. Fixedly attached means that the stock interface is not adjustable or otherwise free to slide along the CAR buffer tube. The stock interface <b>101</b> has been slid into position on the CAR buffer tube. The CAR buffer tube's elongated rib <b>1103</b> has a groove <b>1201</b> into which an appropriately sized bolt <b>1006</b> is placed. A bolt is appropriately sized if it cannot rotate within the groove <b>1201</b>. A fastener <b>1005</b>, illustrated here as a bolt, extends through an interface hole <b>1004</b> in the stock interface <b>101</b> and is threaded into the appropriately sized nut <b>1006</b>. An interface hole <b>1004</b> with a countersunk portion <b>1003</b> is illustrated. Tightening the fastener <b>1005</b> causes the fastener <b>1005</b> to press into the bottom of the groove <b>1201</b> and thereby frictionally attach the stock interface <b>101</b> and the CAR buffer tube together. Aligning an interface hole <b>1004</b> with a buffer tube hole <b>1202</b> can produce a stronger binding between the stock interface <b>101</b> and the CAR buffer tube. Elongating the interface hole <b>1004</b> can ease alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Threading the interface hole <b>1004</b> with a tap can dispense with the need for an appropriately sized nut <b>1006</b> and allow use of a set screw instead of a bolt <b>1005</b>. A second set screw tightened into a threaded interface hole behind a first set screw can bind both set screws within the interface hole. Furthermore, a threaded interface hole adapts the stock interface for installation on either a CAR buffer tube or a cylindrical buffer tube. A bolt threaded through the interface hole <b>1004</b> presses against the side of the cylindrical buffer tube to cause a frictional attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates clamping a stock interface <b>1501</b> to a CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. The stock interface <b>1501</b> is placed over a CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b>. The buffer spring <b>1503</b> can be seen inside the CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b>. The stock interface <b>1501</b> has a bottom gap <b>1507</b> and a hole <b>1504</b>. The hole end <b>1505</b> is threaded so that a bolt <b>1506</b> can be inserted into the hole <b>1504</b> and tightened. Tightening the bolt <b>1506</b> causes the bottom gap <b>1507</b> to narrow which also causes the stock interface <b>1501</b> to clamp onto the CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b>. The clamping action frictionally attaches the stock interface <b>1501</b> to the CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b>. Multiple holes and bolts can be used along the length of the stock interface <b>1501</b> to increase the clamping action and thereby more fixedly clamp the stock interface <b>1501</b> onto the CAR buffer tube <b>1502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates clamping a stock interface <b>1601</b> to a cylindrical buffer tube <b>1602</b> in accordance with aspects of the embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> in that a stock interface <b>1601</b> is placed over a buffer tube and frictionally attached by clamping. A cylindrical buffer tube is illustrated to demonstrate that clamping can be used to frictionally attach stock interfaces to either cylindrical buffer tubes or to CAR buffer tubes. The stock interface <b>1601</b> has a second gap <b>1603</b> that can be narrowed by placing a top bolt <b>1604</b> through a top hole <b>1605</b> and threading it into the top hole bottom <b>1606</b>. Tightening the top bolt <b>1604</b> and the bottom bolt <b>1506</b> causes a clamping action that frictionally attaches the stock interface <b>1601</b> to clamp onto the buffer tube <b>1602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The top gap <b>1603</b> and the bottom gap <b>1507</b> can, but need not, run the full length of the stock interface <b>1601</b>. A stock interface <b>1601</b> with full length gaps can be separated into a threaded side <b>1607</b> and a through hole side <b>1608</b>. A complete stock interface can be formed from two through hole pieces by placing a nut into the hole <b>1504</b> of one through hole piece, placing a bolt into the hole <b>1504</b> of the other through hole side piece, and threading the bolt into the nut.</p>
