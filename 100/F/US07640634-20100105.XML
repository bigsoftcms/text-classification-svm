<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to fasteners characterized by structures which are suitable to be engaged reversibly in a slot of a rigid part, such as a metal sheet or the frame of a car for example. The structure is critical in a manner to provide easy insertion but difficult extraction of the fastener from the slot, without producing squeaking noises during end-use. The invention also pertains to an assembly of said rigid part and the fastener, an assembly connecting parts with the fastener of this invention, as well as vehicles comprising such assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of fasteners have been used in the past for securing one object on another object, as for example, securing an article such as for example a plastic sheet on a metal or other rigid plastic sheet. However, the fasteners of the type, which are improved by the advances of the present invention, and being used presently, have a rather low ratio of insertion force to removal force. In other words, they require considerable force to be inserted into a slot in order to provide adequate removal resistance in order to be removed from the slot. This is ergonomically inferior performance, and the operators may suffer miscellaneous ailments, while productivity is also considerably undermined. In other cases, disadvantages, such as unacceptable squeaking noises during their use in vehicles for example, make such fasteners undesirable and inferior.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of conventional fasteners are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,714 (Smith); U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,319 (Smith); U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,158 (Gronau et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,789 (Fisher et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,373,611 (Murata); U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,280 (Gagliardi); U.S. Pat. No. 5,095,592 (Doerfling); U.S. Pat. No. 4,792,475 (Bien); U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,622 (Ohelke); U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,170 (Schnabl); U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,652 (Kelly et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 3,864,789 (Leitner); U.S. Pat. No. 3,673,643 (Kindell); U.S. Pat. No. 3,525,129 (Holton); U.S. Pat. No. 2,825,948 (Parkin); U.S. Pat. No. 2,607,971 (Bedford, Jr.); U.S. Pat. No. 2,542,883 (Tinnerman); U.S. Pat. No. 2,329,688 (Bedford, Jr.); U.S. Pat. No. 2,322,656 (Murphy), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,019 (Fisher) provides fasteners which can only be permanently installed into a slot; they can only be inserted but not extracted without damage to parts of the fastener. The major engagement is performed by spring strips, while frictional portions of the fastener pass through the slot with at most slight compression, and immediately after the insertion of the fastener they are located in slightly spaced or barely contacting relation with the edges of the slot. They are only activated for engagement after the insertion of a bolt into a hole at the base plate. Thus, the profound effect of the increased removal to insertion ratio (explained in detail hereinbelow) is not recognized, mentioned, or implied. Thus, the intentionally provided distance of the frictional portions away from the edges of the slot by Fisher, during insertion and before use of the bolt, teaches actually away from the instant invention, which recognizes and takes full advantage of the increased removal to insertion ratio by an engagement region having a hindrance portion. According to one embodiment if the engagement surfaces of the instant invention were located in slightly spaced or barely contacting relation with the edges of the slot, no engagement at all would take place upon insertion of the fastener of this invention into the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,837 (Wisniewski) describes a spring fastener comprising bulbous and outwardly projecting portions, which assist in preventing withdrawal of the clip and associated molding from an aperture of a vehicle frame. However, &#x201c;bulbous projections&#x201d; are necessarily voluminous, take most of the space in the inwardly directed section which acts as an engagement region, and unless they are manufactured within tight tolerances with regard to the thickness of the frame, the &#x201c;base plates&#x201d; do not sit on the frame (see also the Figures), rendering the structure unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,240 B1 (Hironaka et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,129,768 (Hoyle et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,550 (Bettini), U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,310 (Belissaire), U.S. Pat. No. 4,712,341 (Harris, Jr. et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,595,325 (Moran et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,355 (Junemann), U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,246 (Small), and U.S. Pat. No. 2,424,757 (F. Klump, Jr.) are directed to plastic or metal fasteners which are designed to be just inserted into the slot of a panel, but not extracted without damage to the fastener (if such extraction would be attempted from the front side; the side from which the fastener is inserted into the panel, since the back part of the panel is not reachable in the cases, wherein such types of fasteners are used).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,380 (Vassiliou) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,745,440 (Vassiliou) disclose fasteners having bent teeth which, however, either produce squeaking noises if they are extending very little, or they prevent extraction of the fastener from a slot without distraction of the fastener, if the teeth extend too much.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In contrast, this invention is characterized by critical configurations providing superior fasteners lacking the above undesirable properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As aforementioned, this invention relates to fasteners characterized by structures which are suitable to be engaged reversibly in a slot of a rigid part, such as a metal sheet or the frame of a car for example.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As aforementioned, this invention relates to fasteners characterized by structures which are suitable to be engaged reversibly in a slot of rigid part, such as a metal sheet or the frame of a car for example. The structure provides easy insertion but difficult extraction of the fastener from the slot, without producing squeaking noises during end-use. The invention also pertains to an assembly of said rigid part and the fastener, an assembly connecting parts with the fastener of this invention, as well as vehicles comprising such assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, there is depicted an example of a fastener <b>10</b> according to the present invention, wherein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) the fastener has a U-shaped structure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fastener <b>10</b> comprises a main body <b>12</b> and a wing <b>14</b> connected to the main body <b>12</b> at a first bend <b>16</b>. The wing <b>14</b> comprises an outwardly directed section <b>18</b> springingly connected to the main body <b>12</b> at the first bend <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wing <b>14</b> further comprises an inwardly directed section <b>20</b> connected to the outwardly directed section <b>18</b> at a second bend <b>22</b> opposite the first bend <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inwardly directed section <b>20</b> has a free end <b>24</b>, a base segment <b>26</b>, and a twisted segment <b>28</b>. The twisted segment <b>28</b> has a front edge <b>30</b>, a back edge <b>32</b>, and a sliding edge <b>40</b>, which includes the back edge <b>32</b>. The front edge <b>30</b> has a low site <b>34</b> in the vicinity of the second bend <b>22</b>, and a high site <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The back edge <b>32</b> is curved from the high site <b>36</b> toward the base segment <b>26</b> of the inwardly directed section <b>20</b>. The inwardly directed section <b>20</b> may have a bent section in the vicinity of the free end <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is highly preferable that the back edge <b>32</b> has a curvature of a gradually decreasing slope. It is also preferable that at least a portion of the front edge <b>30</b> in the vicinity of the low site <b>34</b> of the twisted segment <b>28</b> is substantially on the same plane as the outwardly section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is preferable that the twisted segment <b>28</b> of the fastener <b>10</b> has a twist angle A with respect to the base segment <b>26</b> of the inwardly directed section <b>20</b> in the range of substantially 5 to 175 degrees, more preferably in the range of substantially 75 to 105 degrees, and even more preferably of substantially 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The height H of the twisted segment <b>28</b> in the vicinity of the free end <b>24</b> may be substantially zero or it may be increased, preferably gradually.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fastener <b>10</b> may comprise at least one barb <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which is preferably bent at its front end <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, the fastener <b>10</b> as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is inserted into a slot <b>42</b> of a rigid part <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The outwardly directed section <b>18</b>, which is springingly connected to the main body <b>12</b> of the fastener <b>10</b>, retracts and allows the fastener <b>10</b> to pass through the slot <b>42</b> in a manner that the corner <b>46</b> of the rigid part <b>44</b> finally is forced to reside on the sliding edge <b>40</b> of the twisted segment <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If and when the rigid part <b>44</b> is forced, being a portion of the frame of a vehicle for example, the corner <b>46</b> of the rigid part slides on the siding edge <b>40</b> smoothly. Even if it reaches the back edge <b>32</b> finds great resistance to overcome it, and at the same time it continues the smooth sliding, due to the gradual curvature of the back edge <b>32</b>, and thus it does not produce any grinding or squeaking noises. This is a great advantage, especially because in addition to the above advantages, the manufacturability and dimensional accuracy are excellent since they involve the steps of just cutting and bending.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the present invention, any embodiments of fasteners described above and their equivalents may be used in any assembly in which a part and another part are connected with the fastener, as well as in any vehicle comprising such an assembly or such a fastener or its equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should also be understood that the miscellaneous embodiments and features of the instant invention may be used in any combination or by themselves in other articles or devices, where they may be needed.</p>
