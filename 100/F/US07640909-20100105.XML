<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A vehicle, such as a motorcycle, includes an engine having at least one intake port. An air intake assembly introduces air into the intake port. In one arrangement, the air intake assembly includes a stationary funnel and a movable funnel positioned on the inlet side of the fixed funnel and selectively cooperates with the stationary funnel to deliver air to the intake port of the engine. A seal member creates at least a substantial seal between the fixed funnel and the movable funnel when the funnels are in cooperation with one another. A retention mechanism inhibits the seal member from disengaging with the funnel onto which the seal member is positioned. In one arrangement, the movable funnel is formed with one or more projections and the seal member is formed with one or more recesses that accommodate the projections. The projection may be a flange or a boss, among other possibilities, and the recess is configured to accommodate the specific projection.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a vehicle, and more particularly to a vehicle having a variable length air intake arrangement for introducing air to an intake port of an engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some vehicles incorporate a variable length air intake system. For example, a variable length air intake system shown in Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-182229 includes a stationary intake pipe for introducing air to an intake port of an engine, a movable pipe movably disposed on the air inlet side of the stationary pipe. A rotary arm is positioned on one side of the movable pipe and is attached to the movable pipe. A rotary shaft is positioned on the same side of the movable pipe and is coupled to the rotary arm. A motor is also positioned on the same side of the movable pipe as the rotary arm and shaft, and is configured to drive the rotary arm. In this intake system, the rotary arm is moved rotationally about the rotary shaft by the driving force of the motor, so that the movable pipe attached to the rotary arm can move relative to the stationary pipe to vary a length of the intake system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention involves the realization that, because the structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-182229 is not provided with a seal arrangement to seal the gap between the movable intake pipe and the stationary intake pipe, it is difficult to restrict air leakage through the gap between the movable intake pipe and the stationary intake pipe. Accordingly, it is difficult to supply a desired amount of air to the intake port.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide a vehicle in which air leakage through the gap between a movable intake pipe, or funnel, and a stationary intake pipe, or funnel, can be restricted. More generally, an aspect of one or more preferred embodiments is to provide a seal arrangement for an air intake arrangement having a stationary portion and a movable portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of a preferred embodiment involves a vehicle including an engine having at least one intake port. At least one stationary funnel introduces air to the intake port of the engine. A movable funnel selectively cooperates with the stationary funnel to introduce air to the intake port of the engine. A seal member creates at least a substantial seal between the stationary funnel and the movable funnel when the stationary funnel and the movable funnel cooperate with one another. A retention mechanism retains the seal member to one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel to inhibit disengagement of the seal member from the stationary funnel or the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the vehicle as described in the above paragraph, in which a seal member is disposed between the stationary funnel and the movable funnel, air leakage through the gap between the movable funnel and the stationary funnel can be inhibited or eliminated when the movable funnel is in cooperation with the stationary funnel. With such a construction, a desired amount of air can be supplied to the intake port. In addition, the retention mechanism for retaining the seal member with either one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel is also provided. Thus, the seal member can be prevented from disengaging from the stationary funnel or the movable funnel. With such a construction, it is possible to inhibit or prevent the seal member from falling off from the stationary funnel or the movable funnel and possibly entering the inside of the engine, thereby preventing damage to the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the retention mechanism includes a first engagement defined by one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel, and a second engagement surface defined by the seal member. The first engagement surface engages the second engagement surface to inhibit disengagement of the seal member from the one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel. With such a construction, it is not necessary to provide a separate member for preventing the seal member from falling off from the stationary funnel or the movable funnel, and accordingly the number of parts can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein, the first engagement surface of the one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel is defined by at least one projection. The seal member includes at least one recess that defines the second engagement surface. With such an arrangement, the first engagement surface and the second engagement surface can be easily engaged with one another, and hence the seal member can be easily prevented from falling off of the one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the retention mechanism includes a first engagement surface and a second engagement surface. The first engagement surface is defined by the movable funnel. With such a construction, the first engagement surface is not formed in the stationary funnel, and hence the surface of the stationary funnel can be formed to be smooth. Thus, the passage of air to be supplied to the stationary funnel can be made smooth when the movable funnel is spaced apart from the stationary funnel (when the engine is rotating at a high speed). As a result, the air supplied to the engine can be supplied smoothly, thereby avoiding a decrease in engine output.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the at least one projection comprises a flange extending from a side surface of the movable funnel. The at least one recess comprises an annular recess that accommodates the flange. With such an arrangement, the first engagement surface and the second engagement surface can be tightly engaged with one another by inserting the flange into the annular recess. Thus, the seal member can be more reliably prevented from falling off of the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the at least one projection comprises a boss extending from a side surface of the movable funnel. The at least one recess accommodates the boss. With such a construction, the first engagement surface and the second engagement surface can be tightly engaged with one another by inserting the boss into the recess. Thus, the seal member can be more reliably prevented from falling off from the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the stationary funnel, the movable funnel and the seal member are generally cylindrical in shape. The at least one recess is formed to extend at a predetermined angle with respect to a radial direction of the seal member and the boss extends in substantially the same direction as the at least one recess. With such an arrangement, even when the seal member expands radially, the expanding direction of the seal member is at the predetermined angle with respect to the extending direction of the boss and the recess, and hence the boss can be prevented from disengaging from the recess. In addition, since the boss extends in a direction at the predetermined angle with respect to the radial direction of the seal member, enlargement of the boss in the radial direction of the seal member can be avoided while the area of engagement between the boss and the recess can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the recess is a through hole that extends completely through a wall thickness of the seal member. With this construction, it is easy to check whether or not the second projection is inserted into the second recess by visual inspection of the outside of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the engine has a plurality of intake ports and each of the intake ports is provided with a stationary funnel and a movable funnel. A plurality of the movable funnels are formed integral with one another and the boss extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to a direction in which the plurality of the movable funnels are aligned relative to one another. With this construction, in the case where the plurality of the movable funnels are integrally molded using a split mold, the split line of the mold extends perpendicularly to the direction in which the plurality of the movable funnels are disposed adjacently. This allows the split line of the mold to extend in the same direction as the extending direction of the boss. Thus, the boss can be easily formed to extend in the desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the seal member is preferably secured to either one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel. With this construction, the seal member can be easily prevented from falling off from the stationary funnel or the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the seal member is elastically deformable and includes a first portion having a first axial length and a second portion having a second axial length that is less than the first axial length. With such an arrangement, the seal member can be easily stretched at the second portion. Thus, the seal member can be easily attached to either the stationary funnel or the movable funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Still another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the first engagement surface is defined by a projection and the second engagement surface is defined by a recess. Preferably, the seal member is elastically deformable and includes a first portion having a first axial length and a second portion having a second axial length that is less than the first axial length. The recess is formed in the first axial portion. With this construction, the recess can be easily formed in the seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein a plurality of the movable funnels are formed integrally via a shaft. The seal member is elastically deformable and includes a first portion and a second portion having an axial length that is less than the axial length of the first portion. The shaft of the movable funnels is radially aligned with the second portion of the seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the seal member comprises a seal portion for contact with one of the stationary funnel and the movable funnel in multiple directions. With this construction, air leakage through the gap between the movable funnel and the stationary funnel can be reduced or eliminated when the movable funnel cooperates with the stationary funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Still another aspect of a preferred embodiment involves the vehicle described above, wherein the seal portion includes a first seal portion extending in a direction perpendicular to an axial direction of the seal member and a second seal portion extending in the axial direction of the seal member. With this construction, the gap between the movable funnel and the stationary funnel can be sealed in two ways, that is, in the axial direction of the seal member and in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction.</p>

In addition, the movable funnel <b>27</b> is formed with projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>and a projection <b>27</b><i>g</i>, and the seal member <b>35</b> is formed with engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>and a recess <b>35</b><i>b </i>for engagement with the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>and <b>27</b><i>g</i>, respectively, to prevent the seal member <b>35</b> from falling off from the movable funnel <b>27</b>. Thus, the seal member <b>35</b> can be prevented from falling off from the movable funnel <b>27</b> without providing a separate member specifically for that purpose. With this construction, it is possible to prevent the seal member <b>35</b> and the member for preventing the seal member <b>35</b> from falling off from the movable funnel <b>27</b> from entering the inside of the engine <b>14</b>, thereby preventing damage to the engine <b>14</b>. It will be appreciated that, although referred to as a &#x201c;contacting position&#x201d; between the movable funnel <b>27</b> and the stationary funnel <b>26</b>; the funnels do not necessary come into direct contact with one another. For instance, in the illustrated arrangement, the seal member <b>35</b> provides contact between the stationary funnel <b>26</b> and the movable funnel <b>26</b>. Furthermore, alternative arrangements are possible wherein the funnels remain in contact with one another at all times, even while moving relative to one another to vary a length of the intake passage, such as by a sliding or telescoping arrangement, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the first embodiment, the movable funnel <b>27</b> is formed with a flange-like projection <b>27</b><i>g</i>. Therefore, the projection <b>27</b><i>g </i>and the recess <b>35</b><i>b </i>can be tightly engaged with each other by inserting the projection <b>27</b><i>g </i>into the recess <b>35</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the seal member <b>35</b> can be more reliably prevented from falling off from the movable funnel <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the first embodiment, the movable funnel <b>27</b> is formed with four cylindrical (boss-like) projections <b>27</b><i>f</i>, and the seal member <b>35</b> is formed with four engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>for receiving the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>therein. Therefore, the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>and the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>can be tightly engaged with each other by inserting the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>into the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the seal member <b>35</b> can be more reliably prevented from falling off from the movable funnel <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the first embodiment, the boss-like projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>of the movable funnel <b>27</b> are formed to extend at a predetermined angle (approximately 45&#xb0;) with respect to a radial direction of the seal member <b>35</b> (R direction indicated by the arrow), and the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the seal member <b>35</b> are also formed to extend at a predetermined angle (&#x3b1;&#xb0;=approximately 45&#xb0;) with respect to the radial direction of the seal member <b>35</b> (R direction indicated by the arrow) correspondingly to the projections <b>27</b><i>f</i>. Thus, even when the seal member <b>35</b> expands radially, the expanding direction of the seal member <b>35</b> is at the predetermined angle (&#x3b1;&#xb0;=approximately 45&#xb0;) with respect to the extending direction of the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>and the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a</i>, and hence the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>can be more reliably prevented from coming disengaged from the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a</i>. In addition, since the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>are formed to extend in a direction at the predetermined angle (approximately 45&#xb0;) with respect to the radial direction of the seal member <b>35</b> (R direction indicated by the arrow), enlargement of the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>in radial directions of the seal member <b>35</b> can be avoided while the area of engagement between the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>and the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the first embodiment, since the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>are formed as through holes, it is easy to check whether or not the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>are inserted into the engagement holes <b>35</b><i>a </i>by a visual inspection from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the first embodiment, two movable funnels <b>27</b> are integrated together, and the bosses, or boss-like projections <b>27</b><i>f</i>, are formed to extend in a direction perpendicular to a direction in which the two movable funnels <b>27</b> are disposed adjacently or aligned with one another. Thus, in the case where the two movable funnels <b>27</b> are integrally molded using a split mold, since the split line of the mold extends perpendicularly to the direction in which the two movable funnels <b>27</b> are disposed adjacently, the split line of the mold extends in the same direction as the extending direction of the projections <b>27</b><i>f</i>. With this construction, the projections <b>27</b><i>f </i>can be easily formed in a cylindrical shape (e.g., a boss-like shape).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the first embodiment, the seal member <b>35</b>, which is secured to the movable funnel <b>27</b>, can smooth the passage of air to be supplied to the stationary funnel <b>26</b> when the movable funnel <b>27</b> is spaced apart from the stationary funnel <b>26</b> (when the engine <b>14</b> is rotating at a high speed). Thus, air can be smoothly supplied to the engine <b>14</b>. With this construction, a decrease in engine <b>14</b> output can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the first embodiment, the seal member <b>35</b> is formed with a first seal portion <b>35</b><i>c </i>formed to extend in a radial direction relative to the seal member <b>35</b>, and a tubular second seal portion <b>35</b><i>d </i>extends in the axial direction of the seal member <b>35</b>. Thus, air leakage through the gap between the movable funnel <b>27</b> and the stationary funnel <b>26</b> can be reduced or eliminated when the movable funnel <b>27</b> is moved to the stationary funnel <b>26</b> side (in the contacting position).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 27</figref> illustrate the detailed structure of a seal member and a movable funnel of a motorcycle according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 27</figref>, the second embodiment is different from the first embodiment described above in that the seal part is formed with a portion, or portions, having a reduced axial length compared to other portions or the remainder of the seal part.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the second embodiment, as in the first embodiment, a rubber seal member <b>85</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) is mounted (secured) at the lower end of the movable funnel <b>77</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with four engagement holes <b>85</b><i>a </i>as through holes, as in the first embodiment. Four cylindrical projections <b>77</b><i>f </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) of the movable funnel <b>77</b> are in engagement with the engagement holes <b>85</b><i>a</i>. The engagement hole <b>85</b><i>a </i>is an example of a structure defining an &#x201c;engagement portion&#x201d; and a &#x201c;recess&#x201d; of the present invention. The projection <b>77</b><i>f </i>is an example of a structure defining an &#x201c;engagement portion&#x201d; and a &#x201c;projection&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with a recess <b>85</b><i>b </i>on its inner peripheral surface, as in the first embodiment. A flange-like projection <b>77</b><i>g </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) formed at the bottom of the movable funnel <b>77</b> is in engagement with the recess <b>85</b><i>b</i>. The recess <b>85</b><i>b </i>is an example of a structure defining an &#x201c;engagement portion&#x201d; and a &#x201c;recess&#x201d; of the present invention. The projection <b>77</b><i>g </i>is an example of a structure defining an &#x201c;engagement portion&#x201d; and a &#x201c;projection&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with a first seal portion <b>85</b><i>c </i>extending laterally (radially) and a tubular second seal portion <b>85</b><i>d </i>extending downward (axially).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with a thick portion, or a first portion <b>85</b><i>e </i>with a first axial length and a recessed thin portion, or second portion <b>85</b><i>f </i>with a second axial length that is less than the axial length of the first portion <b>85</b><i>e</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a lower part of the support shafts <b>77</b><i>b </i>and <b>77</b><i>e </i>of the movable funnel <b>77</b> is disposed in the recessed part of the second portion <b>85</b><i>f</i>. The support shaft <b>77</b><i>b </i>is an example of the &#x201c;shaft part&#x201d; of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, the movable funnel <b>77</b> is formed with a recess <b>77</b><i>h</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with a projection <b>85</b><i>g </i>for engagement with the recess <b>77</b><i>h</i>. With this construction, the seal member <b>85</b> can be more reliably prevented from coming off from the movable funnel <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The structure of the other part of the second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment. In the second embodiment, as described above, since the seal member <b>85</b> is formed with a second portion <b>85</b><i>f </i>that has a smaller axial length than the first portion <b>85</b><i>e</i>, the seal member <b>85</b> can be easily stretched at the second or thin portion <b>85</b><i>f</i>. Thus, the seal member <b>85</b> can be easily attached to the movable funnel <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The embodiment disclosed herein is intended to be illustrative in all respects, rather than restrictive. The scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description of the embodiment, and is intended to include all modifications that fall within the meaning and scope equivalent to the appended claims. For example, although the present invention is applied to a motorcycle in the first and second embodiments described above, it is not limited thereto and may also be applied to vehicles other than motorcycles. In the first and second embodiments described above, the seal member is secured to the movable funnel. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the seal member may be secured to the stationary funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the first and second embodiments described above, the movable funnel is formed with four boss-like (cylindrical) projections for securing the seal member to the movable funnel. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the movable funnels may be formed with three or less, or five or more projections for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the first and second embodiments described above, the seal member is provided with a first seal portion and a second seal portion. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the seal member may be formed with a single seal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the first and second embodiments described above, the present invention is applied to a vehicle incorporating a four-cylinder engine. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and may also be applied to vehicles incorporating a multi-cylinder engine other than a four-cylinder one, vehicles incorporating a single-cylinder engine, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the first and second embodiments described above, two movable funnels are integrated together. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and three or more movable funnels may be integrated together. Alternatively, a separate movable funnel may be provided for each cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the first and second embodiments described above, the boss-like projections of the movable funnel are formed to extend at approximately 45&#xb0; with respect to a radial direction of the seal member, and the engagement holes of the seal member are also formed to extend at approximately 45&#xb0; with respect to the radial direction of the seal member.

In this case, the boss-like projections of the movable funnel can be sufficiently prevented from coming off out of the engagement holes of the seal member, if the projections are formed to extend at approximately 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; with respect to a radial direction of the seal member and the engagement holes of the seal member are also formed to extend at approximately 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; with respect to the radial direction of the seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the first and second embodiments described above, the movable funnel is translatable using a parallel link. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the movable funnel may be not provided with a parallel link and hence not translatable, but movable throughout an arcuate path.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Although this invention has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof.
