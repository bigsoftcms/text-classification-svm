<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pneumatic assembly for a paintball gun preferably includes a bolt slidably arranged on a valve stem. The bolt is preferably moveable between an open and a closed position. The bolt preferably provides a firing mechanism for the paintball gun by permitting compressed gas from a compressed gas storage area to flow through the bolt to fire the paintball gun when the bolt is closed but preventing the transfer of compressed gas through the bolt when the bolt is open. An internal area of the valve stem can be arranged to communicate with the compressed gas storage area to increase the effective volume of the compressed gas storage area without increasing the size of the paintball gun. This can permit lower pressure operation of the paintball gun. A supply of compressed gas to the compressed gas storage area can be cut off during firing to improve gas efficiency.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to pneumatic paintball guns (&#x201c;markers&#x201d;) and their operating components. More particularly, this invention relates to pneumatic components used to load and fire paintball markers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the sport of paintball, it is generally desirable to have a marker that is as small and light as possible. Smaller and lighter markers increase a players' mobility. Players benefit from increased mobility by being able to move more quickly from bunker to bunker, making it easier to avoid being hit. Further, in the sport of paintball, the marker is treated as an extension of the body such that a hit to the marker counts as a hit to the player. It is desirable, therefore, to have a paintball gun with as small a profile as possible while substantially maintaining or improving performance characteristics of the marker, such as firing rate, accuracy, and gas efficiency. The size of the paintball gun is generally related to the size and number of operating components that must be housed within the paintball gun body.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment of the present invention, a pneumatic assembly for a paintball gun includes a compressed gas storage chamber and a bolt. The storage chamber can be configured to receive a regulated supply of compressed gas. The bolt is preferably configured to slide back and forth between an open (preferably rearward) and a closed (preferably forward) position to load a paintball into a breech of the paintball gun and to control the release of compressed gas from the compressed gas storage area into the bolt to launch the paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To reduce the size and complexity of the paintball gun, the bolt can be configured to provide the firing mechanism of the pneumatic assembly. More particularly, one or more ports are preferably disposed through a lateral wall of the bolt at a predetermined distance from an end of the bolt. The bolt port(s) are preferably arranged to selectively permit the transfer of compressed gas into the bolt from a compressed gas storage area. Most preferably, the bolt port(s) are configured to convey compressed gas into the bolt when the bolt is disposed in a closed position, but not when the bolt is in an open position. This can be accomplished in any number of different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, a sealing member can be arranged in communication with the bolt at a predetermined distance from a front portion of the assembly. The sealing member preferably keeps compressed gas from passing through the bolt port(s) into the bolt when the bolt is in an open position. In a closed position, however, compressed gas is allowed to pass through the port(s) into the bolt and then out bolt release ports on the front of the bolt to launch a paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one specific embodiment, for example, the bolt can be arranged on a valve stem. A sealing member is preferably arranged on a forward end of the valve stem in communication with an internal surface of the bolt. In another embodiment, a sealing member could be arranged in communication with an external surface of the bolt at a predetermined distance from the front of the assembly. As the bolt travels toward its closed position, the bolt port(s) preferably slide past the sealing member and permit compressed gas to flow from the compressed gas storage area into the bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present invention, a paintball gun preferably includes a body having a breech. A pneumatic assembly is arranged in the body and preferably includes a compressed gas storage chamber and a bolt. The bolt is preferably configured to move to a closed position in the breech to move a paintball into a firing position and to cause compressed gas to be released through the bolt into the breech.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Interchangeable compressed gas storage chambers can be provided having varying internal volumes. These chambers can be color-coded and/or provided with other visual indicia that correspond to their volumes. A viewing aperture can be provided through a lateral wall of the paintball gun body to permit viewing of the storage chamber or other internal components.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The paintball gun may also include a control valve, such as an electronic solenoid valve or a mechanical valve configured to initiate forward movement of the bolt in response to a trigger pull. The control valve can also be used to control rearward movement of the bolt. An electronic eye can also be arranged in the paintball gun in a manner such that no external wiring is required.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to still another aspect of the present invention, a pneumatic assembly for a paintball gun can use a controlled volume of compressed gas to launch a paintball. This can be accomplished, for instance, by supplying the compressed gas to the compressed gas storage chamber through a gas supply port arranged in an internal bolt guide. When the bolt is in a rearward position, bolt apertures communicate compressed gas from the supply port to the compressed gas storage chamber. At the same time, one or more sealing members prevent compressed gas from escaping from the bolt. When the bolt is in a forward position, one or more sealing members preferably substantially cut off the supply of compressed gas from the supply port to the compressed gas storage chamber. At the same time, the compressed gas in the storage chamber is released through the bolt apertures to launch a paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other embodiments can also provide a controlled quantity of compressed gas to launch a paintball. For example, compressed gas can be supplied to a compressed gas storage chamber of a pneumatic assembly through a gas supply port in the pneumatic assembly when a bolt is in a rearward position. A sealing member can be provided to substantially cut off the supply of compressed gas to the storage chamber when the bolt is in its forward position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one such embodiment, the sealing member can be arranged around the bolt, with the gas input port arranged near a forward portion of the pneumatic assembly. When the bolt is closed, gas is prevented or restricted from entering the compressed gas storage chamber. When the bolt is open, gas from the supply port is free to enter the compressed gas storage area. As an added benefit of this configuration, gas from the supply port can assist in opening the bolt for a loading operation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Bolt ports for communicating compressed gas from the compressed gas storage chamber during a firing operation can be configured to permit an internal bolt area to function as part of the compressed gas storage area. Elongated bolt ports and/or additional bolt ports, for instance, can be configured to permit communication between an intermediate area, located between the bolt and the bolt guide, and the compressed gas storage chamber during a firing operation. The elongated bolt ports could, for example, extend beyond opposite sides of a sealing member. An increased volume of gas can thereby be made available to fire the paintball gun, enabling operation at lower pressure, without an increase in the overall size of the pneumatic assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another embodiment illustrating additional inventive principles, a three-way solenoid valve can be used to operate the pneumatic assembly by controlling the supply and release of compressed gas to an end of the pneumatic cylinder. For instance, a constant supply of compressed gas can be supplied to a forward end of the pneumatic cylinder and applied to a smaller piston surface area to drive the bolt rearward. The three-way solenoid valve can be used to selectively supply compressed gas to a larger, rearward surface area during a firing operation to drive the bolt forward by overcoming the force applied to the forward surface area. Use of a three-way solenoid valve can improve the gas efficiency of the pneumatic cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Compressed gas can further be conserved by sealing off the supply of compressed gas to the compressed gas storage area during the firing operation in this embodiment. Channels can be formed, for instance, to permit an input port for the pneumatic cylinder to also supply compressed gas to the compressed gas storage chamber when the bolt is in a rearward position. When the bolt is moved forward, the channel can be closed to prevent or restrict the supply of compressed gas into the compressed gas storage area. The size of the pneumatic assembly can also be reduced as compared to other embodiments by utilizing the same port to supply compressed gas to the piston and to the compressed gas storage chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various other aspects, embodiments, and configurations of this invention are also possible without departing from the principles disclosed herein. This invention is therefore not limited to any of the particular aspects, embodiments, or configurations described herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The accompanying drawings show the construction of various preferred embodiments incorporating principles of the present invention. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b> for a paintball gun is preferably configured to be housed within a single chamber or bore of a paintball gun body <b>110</b>. The pneumatic assembly <b>10</b> preferably includes a compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> configured to store compressed gas for a firing operation, and a pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>. A bolt <b>20</b> preferably extends longitudinally through at least a portion of the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can be coupled to, or formed integrally with, a piston <b>24</b> that is slidably arranged in the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can be slidably mounted on a bolt guide (or valve stem) <b>16</b> and preferably comprises one or more ports <b>22</b> arranged through a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>. The valve stem <b>16</b> can comprise a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on a forward end <b>16</b><i>a </i>thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, when the bolt <b>20</b> is open (e.g., rearward), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref>, the sealing member <b>18</b> prevents compressed gas from flowing through the bolt ports <b>22</b> into the bolt <b>20</b>. When the bolt <b>20</b> is closed (e.g., in a forward position), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>, however, compressed gas from the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> is permitted to flow through the bolt ports <b>22</b> into a forward area <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the bolt <b>20</b>. Movement of the pneumatic piston <b>24</b>, and hence movement of the bolt <b>20</b>, can be controlled by directing compressed gas to, and venting compressed gas from, alternating sides of the pneumatic piston <b>24</b> through cylinder ports <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>. A vent <b>16</b><i>d </i>can be provided through a rearward end of the valve stem <b>16</b> (or other location) to prevent pressure build-up behind the bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, operation of a paintball gun <b>100</b> employing the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 2B</figref> is as follows. When the bolt <b>20</b> is rearward, a paintball (not shown) is permitted to drop into the breech area <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the paintball gun body <b>110</b>. A mechanical or electrical pneumatic valve <b>30</b> (e.g., an electronic solenoid valve) preferably initiates a firing operation in response to a pull on the trigger <b>42</b>. During the firing operation, the pneumatic piston <b>24</b> moves forward under control of the pneumatic valve <b>30</b> by directing compressed gas to a rearward cylinder port <b>14</b><i>b </i>while venting compressed gas from a forward cylinder port <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The bolt <b>20</b> is carried forward by the forward movement of the pneumatic piston <b>24</b>. As the bolt <b>20</b> moves forward, the paintball is loaded into a firing position in a barrel <b>120</b>, which communicates with the breech area <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the paintball gun body <b>110</b>. At the same time, the bolt ports <b>22</b> slide past the sealing member <b>18</b> and an internal chamber <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the bolt <b>20</b> is exposed to the compressed gas in the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. Compressed gas thereby flows through the bolt ports <b>22</b>, into the bolt <b>20</b>, and through gas release ports <b>25</b> to launch the paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to this embodiment, the bolt <b>20</b> of the pneumatic paintball gun <b>100</b> preferably provides the firing mechanism. More specifically, the bolt ports <b>22</b>, formed through the bolt wall <b>21</b> at a predetermined position along the bolt <b>20</b>, are preferably configured to selectively permit and prevent compressed gas from entering the forward bolt area <b>20</b><i>a</i>. This is preferably accomplished by positioning the ports <b>22</b> in a desired relation with respect to the sealing member <b>18</b>. When the bolt <b>20</b> is open, a sealing engagement between the bolt <b>20</b> and the sealing member <b>18</b> preferably prevents compressed gas from entering the ports <b>22</b>. When the bolt <b>20</b> closes, however, the ports <b>22</b> preferably slide past the sealing member <b>18</b> and transmit compressed gas from the compressed gas storage area <b>12</b> into the forward bolt chamber <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The compressed gas then flows out the release ports <b>25</b> to launch a paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In embodiments in which the bolt <b>20</b> is slidably mounted on a valve stem <b>16</b>, a sealing member <b>18</b> (such as an O-ring, plug, or any other sealing structure) is preferably arranged at a forward end <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the valve stem <b>16</b>. The sealing member <b>18</b> thereby preferably prevents compressed gas from entering the bolt <b>20</b> from the compressed gas storage area <b>12</b> until the bolt <b>20</b> reaches a predetermined forward position. As the bolt <b>20</b> approaches its predetermined forward position, the bolt ports <b>22</b> slide past the sealing member <b>18</b> and expose an internal bolt chamber <b>20</b><i>a </i>to compressed gas from the storage chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted, however, that many alternative embodiments are possible without departing from the inventive principles disclosed herein. In one alternative embodiment, for example, a sealing member can be arranged in communication with an external surface <b>21</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the bolt <b>20</b>. As in the earlier embodiment, the sealing member (not shown) could be configured to prevent compressed gas from entering the bolt <b>20</b> from a compressed gas storage area <b>12</b> until the bolt <b>20</b> reaches a closed position. As the bolt closes, the gas entry ports <b>22</b> preferably slide past the sealing member to permit compressed gas to enter the bolt <b>20</b> to launch the paintball from the marker.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-3B</figref>, movement of the bolt <b>20</b> is preferably accomplished using an electronic solenoid valve <b>30</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can, for instance, include two, oppositely arranged piston surface areas <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B formed on a rearward portion of the bolt <b>20</b>. The solenoid valve <b>30</b> can then be configured to alternately supply compressed gas to and vent compressed gas from communication with the two surface areas <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B. More particularly, compressed gas is preferably supplied from the solenoid valve <b>30</b> to a forward surface area <b>24</b>A through a forward port <b>14</b><i>a </i>and vented from a rearward surface area <b>24</b>B through a rearward port <b>14</b><i>b </i>to move the bolt <b>20</b> to a rearward position. Compressed gas is preferably supplied to the rearward surface area <b>24</b>B through the rearward port <b>14</b><i>b </i>and vented from the forward surface area <b>24</b>A through a forward port <b>14</b><i>a </i>to move the bolt <b>20</b> to a forward position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although this configuration preferably uses a single, four-way solenoid valve, various types, numbers, and configurations of solenoid valves can be used to shuttle the bolt between a forward and rearward position. In one alternative embodiment, for instance, pressure from a constant supply of compressed gas (or a spring or other biasing member applying a known force) can be provided to a first piston surface area, with compressed gas being selectively supplied through a three-way solenoid valve to an opposite surface having a sufficient area to operate the bolt. Furthermore, the bolt could be connected to a separate pneumatic piston rather than having piston surface areas formed directly thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref>, a paintball gun body <b>110</b>, can embody various additional inventive principles. In particular, the paintball gun body <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> preferably includes a viewing aperture <b>112</b> arranged through a lateral wall <b>111</b> of the paintball gun body <b>110</b>. A detent aperture <b>114</b> can be provided for placement of a ball detent to prevent paintballs from double feeding. An eye aperture <b>116</b> can also be provided through the body wall <b>111</b> for the positioning of an electronic eye (not shown). The electronic eye preferably senses the presence or absence of a paintball in the breech area <b>110</b><i>a </i>(or the transition of a paintball into the breech area <b>110</b><i>a</i>) of the paintball gun body <b>110</b> to prevent misfiring or breaking a paintball in the breech. An internal wiring aperture <b>116</b><i>a </i>can also be provided from the breech area <b>110</b><i>a </i>to a grip <b>111</b> of the paintball gun <b>100</b> to permit attachment of the electronic eye to a circuit board <b>50</b> of the paintball gun <b>100</b> without any external wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to yet another aspect of this invention, a plurality of compressed gas storage chambers <b>12</b> can be provided, with each of the compressed gas storage chambers <b>12</b> having a different internal volume from the others. Different internal volumes may be desirable to permit firing of a paintball at a desired velocity using a different gas pressure. Selecting an appropriate chamber volume can also improve gas efficiency. In one embodiment, each of the plurality of compressed gas storage chambers <b>12</b> can be provided having a different color, an externally visible sticker or markings, or other size indicator(s) <b>12</b><i>a </i>to represent an internal volume of the chamber <b>12</b>. When the chamber <b>12</b> is arranged in the paintball gun body <b>110</b>, this indicator <b>12</b><i>a </i>can preferably be viewed through the viewing aperture <b>112</b> to permit quick visual determination of the internal volume of the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. The indicators <b>12</b><i>a </i>can, for instance, indicate an actual volume, a relative volume (as compared to other chambers or some independent reference value), or both.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>A for a paintball gun <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) constructed according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>A according to this embodiment preferably provides a fixed-volume firing chamber <b>12</b> to reduce gas consumption and increase the overall efficiency of the paintball gun <b>100</b>. As in the embodiments described previously, the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>A preferably includes a compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and a pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> having a piston <b>24</b> slidably arranged therein. A bolt <b>20</b> is preferably disposed through the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and coupled to (or formed integrally with) the piston <b>24</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can be slidably mounted on a valve stem (or bolt guide) <b>16</b>. The valve stem <b>16</b> preferably comprises a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on a forward end <b>16</b><i>a </i>thereof. The bolt <b>20</b> preferably comprises one or more ports <b>22</b> arranged through a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Unlike the previous described embodiments, however, compressed gas is preferably supplied to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> through the valve stem <b>16</b>. The valve stem <b>16</b> of this embodiment preferably receives compressed gas into an internal passageway <b>16</b><i>c </i>from a compressed gas source (such as a regulator) through an input port <b>15</b>. The input port <b>15</b> can be arranged in the rearward end of the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>A. The compressed gas travels down the passageway <b>16</b><i>c </i>and through output ports <b>16</b><i>b </i>into an intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a </i>located between the bolt <b>20</b> and the valve stem <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the bolt <b>20</b> is in a rearward position, compressed gas is allowed to travel from the intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a </i>into the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> through the bolt ports <b>22</b>. When the bolt transitions to its forward position, however, the supply of compressed gas to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> is preferably cut off (or restricted) as the bolt ports <b>22</b> slide past the sealing member <b>18</b>. At this same time, the compressed gas in the storage chamber <b>12</b> is released through the bolt ports <b>22</b> into and through the bolt <b>20</b>. In this manner, a controlled amount of compressed gas can be used to launch a paintball from the paintball gun <b>100</b> and gas efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B for a paintball gun <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B according to this embodiment also preferably includes a compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and a pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> having a piston <b>24</b> slidably arranged therein. A bolt <b>20</b> is preferably disposed through the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and coupled to (or formed integrally with) the piston <b>24</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can be slidably mounted on a valve stem (or bolt guide) <b>16</b>. The valve stem <b>16</b> preferably comprises a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on a forward end <b>16</b><i>a </i>thereof. The bolt <b>20</b> preferably comprises one or more ports <b>22</b> arranged through a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>. With the bolt <b>20</b> in a rearward position, compressed gas is preferably supplied to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> through an input port <b>15</b> located near a forward end of the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B. A vent <b>16</b><i>d </i>can be provided to release pressure behind the bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, showing the bolt <b>20</b> in a forward position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the bolt <b>20</b> approaches its forward position, a sealing member <b>23</b> arranged around a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> preferably seals off the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> from the gas input <b>15</b> (or restricts a flow of compressed gas into the storage chamber <b>12</b>). At the same time, at least a portion of the bolt ports <b>22</b>A slide past the sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on the valve stem <b>16</b>, thereby releasing compressed gas through the bolt <b>20</b> and out of the bolt ports <b>25</b> to launch a paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Compressed gas supplied through the gas input <b>15</b> can also be used to assist in opening the bolt <b>20</b> following a firing operation to provide a faster loading operation. For example, in the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, differential pressures are applied to the sealing member <b>23</b> after the compressed gas is evacuated from the storage area <b>12</b>. The differential pressures create a rearward force on the sealing member <b>23</b> that assists in opening the bolt <b>20</b> during a loading operation. This results in a faster loading operation and can thereby enable an increased firing rate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to still other principles of this invention, an increased area can be provided for supplying the compressed gas for the firing operation without increasing the external dimensions of the firing chamber <b>12</b>. In the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>B of this embodiment, for example, the bolt ports <b>22</b>A are preferably formed so as to enable an intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a </i>located between the internal bolt surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the valve stem <b>16</b> to supply a portion of the compressed gas for the launching operation. More particularly, with the bolt <b>20</b> arranged in its forward position, the bolt ports <b>22</b>A are preferably formed as slots, holes, or other shapes that extend from one side of the sealing member <b>18</b> to the other, thereby enabling communication between the intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, and the bolt release ports <b>25</b>. Alternatively, additional, separate bolt ports can be provided to permit communication between the intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. In this manner, the size of the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> can be effectively enlarged without changing its external dimensions. By increasing the volume of the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, a lower chamber pressure is required to fire the paintball at the desired velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Yet another embodiment having additional inventive principles is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>C for a paintball gun according to this embodiment preferably includes a compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and a pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>. The pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> preferably houses a piston <b>24</b> slidably arranged therein. A bolt <b>20</b> is preferably disposed through the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and coupled to (or formed integrally with) the piston <b>24</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> can be slidably mounted on a valve stem (or bolt guide) <b>16</b>. The valve stem <b>16</b> preferably comprises a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on a forward end <b>16</b><i>a </i>thereof. The bolt <b>20</b> preferably comprises one or more ports <b>22</b><i>a </i>arranged through a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the bolt <b>20</b> in a rearward position, compressed gas is preferably supplied to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> from the forward port <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>. More specifically, when the bolt <b>20</b> is arranged in an open (e.g., rearward) position, the port <b>14</b><i>a </i>preferably supplies compressed gas to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> via channels <b>21</b><i>b </i>arranged along an external sidewall of the bolt <b>20</b>. The port <b>14</b><i>a </i>also preferably supplies compressed gas to the pneumatic piston <b>24</b> to hold the bolt <b>20</b> open.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, showing the bolt <b>20</b> in a forward position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a rearward surface area <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the piston <b>24</b> is preferably larger than a forward surface area <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the piston <b>24</b>. Accordingly, when compressed gas is supplied to a rearward end of the piston <b>24</b> through the rearward pneumatic cylinder port <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the bolt <b>20</b> is driven forward. A sealing member <b>23</b><i>a </i>is preferably arranged in an inner wall of the pneumatic assembly surrounding a lateral sidewall <b>21</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>. As the bolt <b>20</b> approaches its forward position, the sealing member <b>23</b><i>a </i>preferably engages the rearward portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>of the lateral sidewall <b>21</b> to seal off, or substantially restrict, the flow of compressed gas into the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> from the gas input <b>14</b><i>a </i>through the channels <b>21</b><i>b</i>. At the same time, a portion of the bolt ports <b>22</b><i>a </i>preferably slide past the sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on the valve stem <b>16</b>, thereby releasing compressed gas from the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> and extended chamber area <b>12</b><i>a </i>into the forward area of the bolt <b>20</b> and out of the bolt ports <b>25</b> to launch a paintball.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When a firing operation is completed, compressed gas supplied to the rearward area of the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> is preferably vented away through port <b>14</b><i>b</i>, thereby relieving the pressure applied to the rearward surface area <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the piston <b>24</b>. Port <b>14</b><i>a </i>preferably receives a constant supply of compressed gas from a compressed gas source and therefore preferably applies a constant force to the forward surface area <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the piston <b>24</b>. Accordingly, as the pressure is relieved from the rearward surface area <b>24</b><i>b</i>, the bolt <b>20</b> is driven rearward, thus opening the channels <b>21</b><i>b </i>to receive compressed gas and to thereby supply compressed gas to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. The bolt ports <b>22</b><i>a </i>are also drawn back across the sealing member <b>18</b> to prevent compressed gas from the compressed gas storage area <b>12</b> from escaping through the forward area of the bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this manner, a three-way solenoid valve (not shown) can be employed to operate the pneumatic assembly by controlling the supply and release of compressed gas to the rearward pneumatic cylinder port <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Use of a three-way solenoid valve can improve the gas efficiency of the pneumatic assembly. Compressed gas can further be conserved by sealing off the supply of compressed gas to the compressed gas storage area during the firing operation. The size of the pneumatic assembly can also be reduced as compared to other embodiments by utilizing the same port <b>14</b><i>a </i>to supply compressed gas to the piston <b>24</b> and to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>. Of course, alternative embodiments may also be employed to accomplish the primary inventive objects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additional inventive principles are shown in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are cross-sectional side views of a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>D for a paintball gun constructed according to yet another embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, as in the previous embodiments, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>D for a paintball gun according to this embodiment preferably includes a bolt <b>20</b>D slidably arranged on a valve stem <b>160</b>. In this embodiment, however, the valve stem <b>160</b> preferably includes a hollow internal chamber <b>162</b> that communicates with the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, to provide an increased volume of compressed gas storage without increasing the size of the paintball gun.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, the valve stem <b>160</b> preferably includes an internal chamber <b>162</b> that communicates with an interior of the bolt <b>20</b>D through a plurality of ports <b>164</b>. The internal chamber <b>162</b> can, for instance, comprise a hollowed-out area inside the valve stem <b>160</b> that extends through a substantial portion of the valve stem <b>160</b>. A plug <b>166</b> can be arranged in a rearward portion of the internal chamber <b>162</b>. Alternatively, the internal chamber <b>162</b> can be sized as desired to provide an appropriate storage volume.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the bolt <b>20</b>D is in a rearward position, the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, the intermediate chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>(located between an inside of the bolt <b>20</b>D and the valve stem <b>160</b>), and the internal chamber <b>162</b> are all filled with compressed gas from a compressed gas inlet port <b>15</b>. Together, these chambers provide a storage volume for containing a quantity of compressed gas for the firing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when the bolt is in a forward position, a sealing member <b>23</b> preferably closes off the inlet port <b>15</b> to prevent compressed gas from entering the chambers. In this position, the bolt ports <b>22</b>A are preferably transitioned so as to extend across both sides of a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on the forward end of the valve stem <b>160</b>. Compressed gas from the internal chamber <b>162</b>, from the intermediate chamber <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and from the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> is thereby permitted to enter into a forward passageway of the bolt <b>20</b>D to launch a paintball from the paintball gun. According to this embodiment, therefore, an increased volume of compressed gas can be used to launch a paintball from the paintball gun without increasing the size of the paintball gun.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a pneumatic assembly for a paintball gun, according to a still further embodiment showing other inventive principles. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a pneumatic assembly <b>10</b>E for a paintball gun can be constructed with a valve stem <b>160</b> similar to that of the previous embodiment. In this embodiment, however, a supply of compressed gas for the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b> is provided through the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>, similar to the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, compressed gas is supplied to the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, the intermediate storage area <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and the internal chamber <b>162</b> from the forward end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> while the bolt is in a rearward position. The forward end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b> can, for instance, receive a constant supply of compressed gas from a compressed gas source. When compressed gas is selectively supplied to a rearward end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>, the bolt <b>20</b>E is preferably driven forward such that an external portion of the bolt engages a sealing ring <b>23</b>A, sealing of the compressed gas storage area from receiving compressed gas from the pneumatic cylinder <b>14</b>. Meanwhile, the bolt ports <b>22</b>A are preferably transitioned across a sealing member <b>18</b> arranged on the front of the valve stem <b>160</b> to enable the release of compressed gas from the compressed gas storage chamber <b>12</b>, the intermediate area <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and the internal bolt chamber <b>162</b> through a forward passageway in the bolt. A bumper <b>24</b>A can be provided to absorb impact from the forward bolt movement and reduce wear on the paintball gun components. In this embodiment, therefore, the effective storage volume of the compressed gas storage area can be increased without increasing the size of the paintball gun. An increased compressed gas storage volume permits lower pressure operation of the paintball gun.</p>
