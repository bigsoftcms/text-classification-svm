<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-379693 filed on Dec. 28, 2005, including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a vehicular torque converter. More particularly, the invention relates to an improvement that makes it easier to check assembly of a thrust bearing during manufacturing and the like of the vehicular torque converter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A torque converter is a fluid power-transmitting device that is provided in a power transmission path between a power source and an automatic transmission of a vehicle and multiplies torque generated by that power source and transmits it to the automatic transmission. The torque converter is provided with a thrust bearing that is assembled onto a turbine hub and rotatably supports a one-way clutch in the circumferential direction with respect to the turbine hub (see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2004-132526). Recently, there is a trend to make the thrust bearing thinner in order to make the torque converter as thin as possible due to a demand to make devices smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the related art, in order to prevent the thrust bearing from being left out or assembled backwards or the like, the torque converter is provided with a structure in which the height of the assembled turbine when it is assembled properly differs from that when the thrust bearing is missing or has been assembled backwards or the like. In order to make the torque converter as thin as possible, however, it is necessary to eliminate this structure which provided for the sole purpose of checking assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The purpose of this invention is to provide a vehicular torque converter in which assembly of a thrust bearing can be easily checked, and a method for checking assembly of the thrust bearing of the vehicular torque converter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to a vehicular torque converter which includes a turbine hub which fixes a turbine runner to an output shaft such that the turbine runner does not rotate relative to the output shaft in a circumferential direction; a one-way clutch arranged on an inner peripheral side of a stator; and a thrust bearing that is assembled onto the turbine hub and supports the one-way clutch with respect to the turbine hub such that the one-way clutch is able to rotate relative to the turbine hub in the circumferential direction. The turbine hub has a through-hole that extends through the turbine hub in an axial direction, and the through-hole is such that a portion of the thrust bearing covers part of the through-hole when the thrust bearing is properly assembled onto the turbine hub.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This structure enables assembly of the thrust bearing to be checked from the relative positional relationship of the through-hole and the thrust bearing. If a portion of the thrust bearing does not cover part of the through-hole, then it can be determined that either the thrust bearing is not assembled or it has been assembled improperly. That is, a vehicular torque converter in which assembly of the thrust bearing can easily be checked can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The through-hole may also be an oil hole for transferring hydraulic fluid. According to this structure, an oil hole provided in the turbine hub can be used as the through-hole for checking assembly. Therefore, assembly of the thrust bearing can easily be checked using the oil hole, so another through-hole does not need to be provided to check assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, the thrust bearing may include a plurality of rollers aligned in the radial direction and separated by predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction and a pair of disc-shaped thrust bearing races that sandwich the plurality of rollers, and an inner peripheral edge portion of one of the thrust bearing races that contacts the turbine hub, from among the pair of disc-shaped thrust bearing races, may be shaped to cover part of the through-hole. This enables assembly of the thrust bearing to be easily checked using a practical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A second aspect of the invention relates to a method for checking assembly of a thrust bearing of a vehicular torque converter. This method is characterised by including the step of checking assembly of the thrust bearing based on whether a pin having radial dimensions that enable it to be inserted through the through-hole is able to be inserted at least a predetermined amount through the through-hole when the turbine hub has been assembled onto the vehicular torque converter according to the first aspect described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this second aspect, the pin is able to be inserted through the through-hole when a portion of the thrust bearing is not covering part of the through-hole, which means that if the pin is able to be inserted through the through-hole, it can be determined that either the thrust bearing is not assembled or that it was not assembled properly. That is, it is possible to provide a method for checking assembly of the thrust bearing of the torque converter in which assembly of the thrust bearing can easily be checked</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following description and the accompanying drawings, the present invention will be described in more detail in terms of exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a skeleton view of the structure of a power-transmitting device <b>10</b> provided with a vehicular torque converter <b>14</b> (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;torque converter <b>14</b>&#x201d;) according to a first example embodiment of the invention. This power-transmitting device <b>10</b> is used, for example, in a FF (i.e., front engine-front drive) type vehicle having a transverse mounted automatic transmission <b>16</b>. An engine <b>12</b>, which is an internal combustion engine, for example, is provided as the power source for running. Output from the engine <b>12</b> is transmitted to left and right driven wheels via the torque converter <b>14</b>, which is the first example embodiment of the invention, the automatic transmission <b>16</b>, a differential gear unit, not shown, and a pair of axles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The torque converter <b>14</b> is a fluid power-transmitting device that multiplies torque generated by the engine <b>12</b> and transmits it to the automatic transmission <b>16</b>. The torque converter <b>14</b> includes a pump impeller <b>20</b>, which is connected to a crankshaft <b>18</b> of the engine <b>12</b>, that serves as an input shaft; a turbine runner (i.e., turbine impeller) <b>24</b>, which is connected to an input shaft <b>22</b> of the automatic transmission <b>16</b>, that serves as an output shaft; and a stator (i.e., a fixed impeller) <b>30</b>, which is connected to a transmission case <b>36</b> (i.e., a housing) via a one-way clutch (i.e., a one-way engaging element) <b>28</b>, and the like. Also, a lock-up clutch <b>26</b> is provided between the pump impeller <b>20</b> and the turbine runner <b>24</b>. The lock-up clutch <b>26</b> is a hydraulic friction clutch that applies friction according to differential pressure &#x394;P between the hydraulic pressure inside an apply side oil chamber <b>32</b> and a release side oil chamber <b>34</b>. When the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> is fully applied, the pump impeller <b>20</b> and the turbine runner <b>24</b> rotate together as a single unit. Also, by feedback controlling the differential pressure &#x394;P, i.e., the apply torque, so that the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> is applied in a predetermined slip state, the turbine runner <b>24</b> follows the rotation of the pump impeller <b>20</b> with a predetermined slip amount of approximately 50 rpm, for example, when the vehicle is being driven (i.e., power on); on the other hand, when the vehicle is not being driven (i.e., power off) the pump impeller <b>20</b> may follow the rotation of the turbine runner <b>24</b> with a predetermined slip amount of approximately &#x2212;50 rpm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The automatic transmission <b>16</b> has a first transmitting portion <b>41</b> which includes a single pinion type first planetary gear set <b>40</b> as its main component, and a second transmitting portion <b>43</b> which includes a single pinion type second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and a double pinion type third planetary gear set <b>44</b> as its main components, both of which are on the same axis. The first transmitting portion <b>41</b> and the second transmitting portion <b>43</b> are used to appropriately change the rate and/or direction of rotation that is input from the input shaft <b>22</b> and outputs the changed rotation to an output gear <b>46</b>. The input shaft <b>22</b> corresponds to an input member and is for example a turbine shaft of the torque converter that is rotatably driven by a driving power source such as, for example, an engine. The output gear <b>46</b> corresponds to an output member that is in mesh either directly or via a counter shaft with the differential gear unit and drives the left and right driven wheels. The automatic transmission <b>16</b> has a generally symmetrical structure with respect to its center line so the half below the center line is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The same also applies to the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first planetary gear set <b>40</b> which constitutes the first transmitting portion <b>41</b> includes three rotating elements, a sun gear S<b>1</b>, a carrier CA<b>1</b>, and a ring gear R<b>1</b>. The carrier CA<b>1</b> as an intermediate output member rotates slower than the input shaft <b>22</b> by rotating the sun gear S<b>1</b>, which is connected to the input shaft <b>22</b>, and holding the ring gear R<b>1</b> stationary by a third brake B<b>3</b> that locks it to the transmission case <b>36</b>. Further, four rotating elements RM<b>1</b> to RM<b>4</b> are formed by portions of the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and the third planetary gear set <b>44</b>, which together constitute the second transmitting portion <b>43</b>, that are connected together. More specifically, a sun gear S<b>3</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>44</b> forms the first rotating element RM<b>1</b>. A ring gear R<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and a ring gear R<b>3</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>44</b> are connected together and form the second rotating element RM<b>2</b>. A carrier CA<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and a carrier CA<b>3</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>44</b> are connected together and form the third rotating element RM<b>3</b>, and a sun gear S<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> forms the fourth rotating element RM<b>4</b>. The second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and the third planetary gear set <b>44</b> are structured such that the carrier CA<b>2</b> also serves as the carrier CA<b>3</b>, and the ring gear R<b>2</b> also serves as the ring gear R<b>3</b>. Also, the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> and the third planetary gear set <b>44</b> together form a Ravigneaux type planetary gear train in which the pinion gear of the second planetary gear set <b>42</b> also serves as a second pinion gear of the third planetary gear set <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first rotating element RM<b>1</b> (sun gear S<b>3</b>) is selectively connected to the transmission case <b>36</b> by a first brake B<b>1</b> to prevent the first rotating element RM<b>1</b> from rotating. Similarly, the second rotating element RM<b>2</b> (ring gears R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>) is selectively connected to the transmission case <b>36</b> by a second brake B<b>2</b> to prevent the second rotating element RM<b>2</b> from rotating. Further, the fourth rotating element RM<b>4</b> (sun gear S<b>2</b>) is selectively connected to the input shaft <b>22</b> via a first clutch C<b>1</b>, while the second rotating element RM<b>2</b> (the ring gears R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>) are selectively connected to the input shaft <b>22</b> via a second clutch C<b>2</b>. The first rotating element RM<b>1</b> (sun gear S<b>3</b>) is integrally connected to the carrier CA<b>1</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>40</b>, which serves as the intermediate output member. The third rotating element RM<b>3</b> (carriers CA<b>2</b> and CA<b>3</b>) is integrally connected with the output gear <b>46</b> and outputs rotation. The first brake B<b>1</b> to the third brake B<b>3</b> and the first clutch C<b>1</b> and the second clutch C<b>2</b> (hereinafter simply referred to as clutches C and brakes B when there in no need to specify the specific clutch or brake) are all hydraulic friction application devices, such as multiple-disc clutches and brakes, which are controlled to apply friction using hydraulic actuators. The hydraulic circuits of the clutches C and brakes B are switched by energizing and de-energizing linear solenoid valves SL<b>1</b> and SL<b>2</b> and solenoid valves Sol<b>1</b> to Sol<b>5</b> provided in a hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or by a manual valve (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clutch and brake application chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the relationship between the application state of the clutches and brakes and the various speeds, with a circle indicating application.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block line diagram illustrating a control system provided in a vehicle, for controlling operation of the automatic transmission <b>16</b> and the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> of the torque converter <b>14</b>, and the like. An electronic control unit (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;ECU&#x201d;) <b>48</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a so-called microcomputer provided with a CPU, RAM, ROM, and an input/output interface and the like. The CPU of the ECU <b>48</b> executes basic controls such as output control of the engine <b>12</b>, shift control of the automatic transmission <b>16</b>, and lock-up clutch control of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> and the like by processing signals according to programs stored beforehand in the ROM while using the RAM to temporarily store data. When necessary, the CPU may be structured such that the portion for engine control is separate from the portion for hydraulic control.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the control system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an accelerator operation amount sensor <b>51</b> detects the accelerator operation amount Acc, which is the amount by which the accelerator pedal <b>50</b> is depressed. The accelerator pedal <b>50</b> is depressed according to the amount of output required by a driver. The accelerator operation amount Acc indicates the required output amount. In addition, various other sensors and switches are provided, some of which include an engine speed sensor <b>58</b> for detecting the speed N<sub>E </sub>of the engine <b>12</b>; an intake air quantity sensor <b>60</b> for detecting the intake air quantity Q of the engine <b>12</b>; an intake air temperature sensor <b>62</b> for detecting the temperature T<sub>A </sub>of the intake air; a throttle sensor <b>64</b>, with an idling switch, for detecting when an electronic throttle valve, not shown, is fully closed (i.e., when the engine <b>12</b> is idling) as well as detecting the opening amount &#x3b8;<sub>TH </sub>of the electronic throttle valve; a vehicle speed sensor <b>66</b> for detecting the vehicle speed V, which corresponds to a rotation speed N<sub>OUT </sub>of the output gear <b>46</b>; a coolant temperature sensor <b>68</b> for detecting the coolant temperature T<sub>W </sub>of the engine <b>12</b>; a brake switch <b>70</b> for detecting operation of the foot brake, i.e., the service brake; a shift lever position sensor <b>74</b> for detecting a position (i.e., operating position) P<sub>SH </sub>of the shift lever <b>72</b>; a turbine rotation speed sensor <b>76</b> for detecting the turbine rotation speed N<sub>T</sub>, which corresponds to a rotation speed N<sub>IN </sub>of the input shaft <b>22</b>; an automatic transmission (AT) oil temperature sensor <b>78</b> for detecting the AT oil temperature T<sub>OIL</sub>, i.e., the temperature of the hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b>; an upshift switch <b>80</b>, and a downshift switch <b>82</b>. These sensors and switches send various signals to the ECU <b>48</b> that indicate, for example, the engine speed N<sub>E</sub>, the intake air quantity Q, the intake air temperature T<sub>A</sub>, the throttle valve opening amount &#x3b8;<sub>TH</sub>, the vehicle speed V, the engine coolant temperature T<sub>W</sub>, brake operation, the position P<sub>SH </sub>of the shift lever <b>72</b>, the turbine rotation speed N<sub>T</sub>, the AT oil temperature T<sub>OIL</sub>, an upshift command R<sub>UP </sub>of the shift range, and a downshift command R<sub>DN </sub>of the shift range, and the like. Further, the ECU <b>48</b> is also connected to an ABS (anti-lock braking system) <b>84</b> that controls the braking force in the wheels so that the wheels will not lock up (i.e., slip) when the foot brake is operated. The ECU <b>48</b> thus also receives information regarding the brake hydraulic pressure corresponding to the braking force, and the like. In addition, the ECU <b>48</b> also receives a signal from an air conditioner <b>86</b> indicative of its operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes, in addition to the solenoid valves Sol<b>1</b> to Sol<b>5</b> and the linear solenoid valves SL<b>1</b> and SL<b>2</b> for shifting described above, a linear solenoid valve SLU that mainly controls the lockup hydraulic pressure, i.e., the differential pressure &#x394;P between the hydraulic pressure in the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b> and the hydraulic pressure in the release side oil chamber <b>34</b>, and a linear solenoid valve SLT that mainly controls the line hydraulic pressure, and the like. The hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b> is also used to lubricate various parts in the automatic transmission <b>16</b> and the like as well as supplied to the lock-up clutch <b>26</b>. Also, the hydraulic pressure friction application devices of the automatic transmission <b>16</b> and the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> are controlled by the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b> using as the base pressure the hydraulic pressure generated by a mechanical oil pump <b>90</b>, which is mechanically connected to the engine <b>12</b>. The mechanical oil pump <b>90</b> is directly driven by the engine and rotates in sync with the engine speed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The ECU <b>48</b> performs shift control of the automatic transmission <b>16</b> and lock-up clutch control of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b>, and the like. The shift control of the automatic transmission <b>16</b> determines the gear speed into which the automatic transmission <b>16</b> should be shifted, i.e., selects the gear speed to shift into from the current gear speed, based on the actual throttle opening amount &#x3b8;<sub>TH </sub>and the vehicle speed V from a shift map (shift line diagram) such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, which is stored in advance, according to the shift lever position P<sub>SH </sub>of the shift lever <b>72</b>. The shift control then executes a shift output that starts an operation to shift the automatic transmission <b>16</b> into the selected gear speed. The solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an upshift line and the broken line is a downshift line. The automatic transmission <b>16</b> switches into a lower gear speed having a larger speed ratio (=input rotation speed N<sub>IN</sub>/output rotation speed N<sub>OUT</sub>) as the vehicle speed V decreases or the throttle valve opening amount &#x3b8;<sub>TH </sub>increases. Numerals &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;6&#x201d; in the drawing refer to a first gear speed &#x201c;1st&#x201d; to a sixth gear speed &#x201c;6th&#x201d;, respectively. Also, the lock-up clutch control of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> continuously controls the apply torque, i.e., the apply force, of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b>. For example, the lock-up clutch control controls the apply state of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> according to a map of a release region, a slip control region, and an apply region, which is stored beforehand with the throttle valve opening amount &#x3b8;<sub>TH </sub>and the vehicle speed V as parameters, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The lock-up clutch control outputs a drive duty ratio D<sub>SLU </sub>which is a drive signal for the solenoid valve SLU that controls the differential pressure &#x394;P of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> in order to control a rotation speed difference (i.e., slip amount) N<sub>SLP </sub>between the turbine rotation speed N<sub>T </sub>and the engine speed N<sub>E </sub>(i.e., N<sub>SLP</sub>=N<sub>E</sub>&#x2212;N<sub>T</sub>) to a target rotation speed N<sub>SLP</sub>*. In the slip control, the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> is maintained in a slip state in order to suppress power transmission loss of the torque converter <b>14</b> as much as possible while absorbing rotational fluctuations in the engine <b>12</b> with the aim of improving fuel efficiency as much as possible without adversely affecting drivability.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a detailed sectional view of the structure of the torque converter <b>14</b>. The torque converter <b>14</b> includes the pump impeller <b>20</b>, the turbine runner <b>24</b>, the lock-up clutch <b>26</b>, the one-way clutch <b>28</b>, and the stator <b>30</b> and the like described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pump impeller <b>20</b> is connected both to a rear case <b>112</b> and a front case <b>98</b>, which are connected to the crankshaft <b>18</b> that transmits output of the engine <b>12</b>, and rotate at the same speed and around the same axis as the crankshaft <b>18</b>. When the front case <b>98</b> rotates due to the engine <b>12</b> being driven, the pump impeller <b>20</b> rotates together with the front case <b>98</b>. As the pump impeller <b>20</b> rotates, hydraulic fluid filled in the pump impeller <b>20</b> is pushed against vanes inside the pump impeller <b>20</b> and rotated, and as it does so, it is driven outward in the circumferential direction by the centrifugal force generated by that rotation. The hydraulic fluid then strikes the vanes of the turbine runner <b>24</b>, which is arranged facing the pump impeller <b>20</b>. The force of the hydraulic fluid striking the vanes of the turbine runner <b>24</b> causes the turbine runner <b>24</b> to rotate, after which the hydraulic fluid flows along the curve of the vanes of the turbine runner <b>24</b> and back to the pump impeller <b>20</b> through the stator <b>30</b>, thus circulating through the torque converter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, when the relative rotation speed difference between the pump impeller <b>20</b> and the turbine runner <b>24</b> is relatively large, such as when the pump impeller <b>20</b> starts to rotate, the hydraulic fluid flows out from the turbine runner <b>24</b> in a direction that impedes rotation of the pump impeller <b>20</b>. By providing the stator <b>30</b> between the pump impeller <b>20</b> and the turbine runner <b>24</b> via the one-way clutch <b>28</b> that is splined to a tube-like fixed shaft <b>23</b>, which is a non-rotating member provided integrally with the transmission case <b>36</b>, however, the hydraulic fluid is redirected by vanes on the stator <b>30</b> in a direction that assists with the rotation of the pump impeller <b>20</b>. When the rotation speed of the turbine runner <b>24</b> increases or the relative rotation speed difference between the pump impeller <b>20</b> and the turbine runner <b>24</b> decreases, on the other hand, the stator <b>30</b> impedes the flow of hydraulic fluid. However, the stator <b>30</b> freewheels via the one-way clutch <b>26</b> and thus does not impede the flow of hydraulic fluid as it otherwise would. The turbine runner <b>24</b> is connected by a rivet <b>102</b> to a turbine hub <b>100</b>, which is splined to the input shaft <b>22</b> of the automatic transmission <b>16</b>, which corresponds to the output shaft. With this structure, when the turbine runner <b>24</b> rotates, that rotation is transmitted from the input shaft <b>22</b> to the automatic transmission <b>16</b> via the turbine hub <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged sectional view detailing a portion of the structure near the one-way clutch <b>28</b> of the torque converter <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the one-way clutch <b>28</b> includes an outer race <b>104</b> arranged on the inner peripheral side of the stator <b>30</b>, an inner race <b>106</b> arranged on the outer peripheral side of the fixed shaft <b>23</b>, which is a non-rotating member, and a sprag <b>107</b> and a pair of end bearings <b>108</b> arranged in the space between the outer race <b>104</b> and the inner race <b>106</b>. Also, a thrust bearing <b>110</b> is arranged in the space between the outer race <b>104</b> and the turbine hub <b>100</b> so that the outer race <b>104</b> can rotate in the circumferential direction with respect to the turbine hub <b>100</b> while being supported in the axial direction. Similarly, a thrust bearing <b>114</b> is arranged in the space between the outer race <b>104</b> and the rear case <b>112</b>, which is integrally formed with the front case <b>98</b> and thus rotates together with the front case <b>98</b>. As a result, the outer race <b>104</b> can rotate in the circumferential direction with respect to the rear case <b>112</b> while being supported in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thrust bearing <b>110</b> includes a plurality of rollers (i.e., rolling bodies) <b>111</b> aligned in the radial direction and separated from one another in the circumferential direction by predetermined intervals, and a pair of disc-shaped thrust-bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> which sandwich the plurality of rollers <b>111</b>. The thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> is arranged between the rollers <b>111</b> and the outer race <b>104</b>, and the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b> is arranged between the rollers <b>111</b> and the turbine hub <b>100</b>. Similarly, the thrust bearing <b>114</b> includes a plurality of rollers (i.e., rolling bodies) <b>115</b> aligned in the radial direction and separated from one another in the circumferential direction by predetermined intervals, and a pair of disc-shaped thrust-bearing races <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> which sandwich the plurality of rollers <b>115</b>. The thrust-bearing race <b>118</b> is arranged between the rollers <b>115</b> and the outer race <b>104</b>, and the thrust-bearing race <b>118</b> is arranged between the roller <b>115</b> and the rear case <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outer race <b>104</b> is a stepped structure (i.e., has different dimensions in the radial direction) with at least one step in the axial direction, having a large diameter portion with relatively large dimensions in the radial direction and a small diameter portion with relatively small dimensions in the radial direction. Also, at least one groove <b>104</b><i>f </i>is formed extending all the way through in the axial direction in the outer peripheral surface of the outer race <b>104</b>. A protruding portion <b>30</b><i>f</i>, which protrudes toward the inner peripheral side and fits into that groove <b>104</b><i>f</i>, is formed on the inner peripheral side of the stator <b>30</b>. When the torque converter <b>14</b> is assembled, the protruding portion <b>30</b><i>f </i>formed on the inner peripheral surface of the stator <b>30</b> fits into the groove <b>104</b><i>f </i>formed in the outer peripheral surface of the outer race <b>104</b>, thus preventing the stator <b>30</b> from rotating relative to the outer race <b>104</b> in the circumferential direction, i.e., the stator <b>30</b> and the outer race <b>104</b> rotate together as a single unit around a common axis. Also, an edge portion <b>116</b><i>e </i>which extends in the axial direction of the stator <b>30</b> so as to cover the outer periphery of the small diameter portion of the outer race <b>104</b>, as well as a hook-shaped pawl portion <b>116</b><i>f </i>that extends (offset) in the axial direction from an end portion in the axial direction of that edge portion <b>116</b><i>e</i>, are formed on an outer peripheral portion of the thrust bearing race <b>116</b> on the turbine hub <b>100</b> side of the thrust bearing <b>110</b>. A plurality (the number being equal to the number of grooves <b>104</b>) of these pawl portions <b>116</b><i>f </i>may also be provided so as to be able to fit into the grooves <b>104</b><i>f </i>of the outer race <b>104</b>. That is, when the torque converter <b>14</b> is in an assembled state, the pawl portions <b>116</b><i>f </i>formed on the outer peripheral portion of the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> fit into the grooves <b>104</b><i>f </i>formed in the outer peripheral surface of the outer race <b>104</b> in a bell-and-spigot configuration in which the edge portion <b>116</b><i>e </i>covers the end portion of the small diameter portion of the outer race <b>104</b> and the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> contacts one end surface of the outer race <b>104</b> in the axial direction. According to this structure, the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> is prevented from rotating relative to the outer race <b>104</b> in the circumferential direction, i.e., the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> and the outer race <b>104</b> rotate together as a single unit around a common axis.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, the pawl portion <b>116</b><i>f </i>also functions as an engaging portion that engages with a snap ring <b>120</b>. When the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> is in a state assembled onto the torque converter <b>14</b>, the snap ring <b>120</b> is provided on the inner peripheral side of the stator <b>30</b> so as to overlap with the pawl portion <b>116</b><i>f </i>of the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b> in the radial direction of the stator <b>30</b> while a snap ring <b>122</b> is provided on the inner peripheral side of the stator <b>30</b> so as to overlap with the outer peripheral portion of the thrust-bearing race <b>118</b> in order to prevent the outer race <b>104</b>, the thrust-bearing race <b>116</b>, and the thrust-bearing race <b>118</b> from moving relative to the stator <b>30</b> in the axial direction. The thrust-bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are arranged adjacent to one end surface in the axial direction of the outer race <b>104</b>, the inner race <b>106</b>, and the end bearing <b>108</b>, and function as support members to inhibit the end bearing <b>108</b> from moving relative to the outer race <b>104</b> and the inner race <b>106</b> in the axial direction. According to this structure, the stator <b>30</b> is allowed to rotate in one direction but prevented from rotating in the reverse direction with respect to the fixed shaft <b>23</b> so that the torque converter <b>14</b> operates as described above. Torque generated from the engine <b>12</b>, which is the power source, is then appropriately multiplied and transmitted to the automatic transmission <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also, a plurality of oil holes are provided in the torque converter <b>14</b> for transferring hydraulic fluid controlled by the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b>. As described above, the application state of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> provided in the torque converter <b>14</b> is controlled by hydraulic fluid supplied from the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b>, and hydraulic fluid transferred through the plurality of oil holes (i.e., oil paths) described below is related to the control of the application state of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b>. That is, the torque converter <b>14</b> is provided with a first oil path (an apply oil path) <b>124</b> for introducing hydraulic fluid that has been pressure-regulated by the hydraulic fluid control circuit <b>88</b> into the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b>, a second oil path (a release oil path) <b>126</b> for introducing hydraulic fluid that has been pressure-regulated by the hydraulic fluid control circuit <b>88</b> into the release side oil chamber <b>34</b>, and a third oil path <b>128</b> for discharging hydraulic fluid from the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b>. The differential pressure &#x394;P between the hydraulic pressure in the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b> and the hydraulic pressure in the release side oil chamber <b>34</b> is controlled by the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b> by transferring hydraulic fluid between the hydraulic pressure control circuit <b>88</b>, the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b> and the release side oil chamber <b>34</b> via these oil paths. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the turbine hub <b>100</b> has a through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>that extends through the turbine hub <b>100</b> in the axial direction (that is, in the direction of the rotational axis, i.e., in the axial direction of the input shaft <b>22</b>). In this example embodiment, the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>functions as an oil hole for transferring hydraulic fluid and forms a portion of the third oil path <b>128</b> for discharging hydraulic fluid from the apply side oil chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a further enlarged sectional view detailing the structure of a portion near the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>in the torque converter <b>14</b> (i.e., portion VIII which is outlined by a thin broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As shown in the drawing, the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is such that, when the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is properly assembled onto the turbine hub <b>100</b>, an inner peripheral edge portion of the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b> that contacts the turbine hub <b>100</b>, from among the pair of thrust-bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> of the thrust bearing <b>110</b>, covers a portion of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>. In other words, the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>and the thrust bearing <b>110</b> are provided so that a portion of a member forming the thrust bearing <b>110</b> overlaps with the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>. An overlap length &#x394;l (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b> with respect to the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is appropriately determined in a range that enables assembly to be checked, as described in detail below, but which does not impede the function of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>as an oil hole.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of the torque converter <b>14</b> as it appears during assembly in the manufacturing process and the like. The torque converter <b>14</b> may be assembled according to the following steps, for example. That is, the pump side thrust bearing <b>114</b> (the portion excluding the thrust bearing race <b>118</b>) is first assembled in the first step using a pump sub-assembly <b>130</b> in which the pump impeller <b>20</b> is assembled inside the rear case <b>112</b> as a base. Next in the second step, a stator sub-assembly <b>132</b> in which the one-way clutch <b>28</b> is arranged on the inner peripheral side of the stator <b>30</b> and the thrust-bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are retained at both ends of the one-way clutch <b>28</b> by the snap rings <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> is assembled. Then in the third step, the turbine side thrust bearing <b>110</b> (the portion excluding the thrust bearing race <b>116</b>) is assembled. Next, in the fourth step, a turbine sub-assembly <b>134</b> in which the turbine runner <b>24</b> and a damper <b>26</b><i>d </i>of the lock-up clutch <b>26</b> are connected to the turbine hub <b>100</b> via a rivet <b>102</b> is assembled. Next in the fifth step, assembly of the turbine side thrust bearing <b>110</b> is checked. Then in the sixth step and thereafter, the front case <b>98</b> and the like are assembled. In this way, the torque converter <b>14</b> such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a partial sectional view illustrating a method for checking assembly of the turbine side thrust bearing <b>110</b> according to this example embodiment of the invention (this drawing corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the fifth step in this example embodiment, assembly of the turbine side thrust bearing <b>110</b> is checked by checking whether a pin <b>136</b>, which has radial dimensions that enable it to be inserted through the <b>100</b><i>h </i>formed in the turbine hub <b>100</b>, can be inserted through that through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>when the turbine sub-assembly <b>134</b> including the turbine hub <b>100</b> has been assembled. The radial dimensions of the pin <b>136</b> used for this check must at least enable the pin <b>136</b> to just fit through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>when the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is not in an assembled state, but not enable the pin <b>136</b> to be inserted through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>when the thrust bearing <b>110</b> (i.e., the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b>) has been assembled. With this combination of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>and the pin <b>136</b>, when a portion of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is covered by the inner peripheral edge portion of the thrust bearing race <b>117</b>, the pin <b>136</b> is stopped by that thrust bearing race <b>117</b> and unable to protrude through to the thrust bearing race <b>117</b> side. On the other hand, if a portion of the through hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is not covered by the inner peripheral edge portion of the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b>, the pin <b>136</b> is able to protrude through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>to the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b> side. Therefore, if, upon insertion of the pin <b>136</b> into the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>in the fifth step, the pin <b>136</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>but unable to protrude through to the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b> side, the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is determined to be assembled properly. On the other hand, if, upon insertion of the pin <b>136</b> into the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>in the fifth step, the pin <b>136</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>and is able to protrude through to the thrust bearing race <b>117</b> side, it is determined that either the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is not assembled or that it was assembled improperly. This check using the pin <b>136</b> may be performed manually (i.e., by a person) or mechanically (automatically) by a checking machine that includes the pin <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this way, the turbine hub <b>100</b> of this example embodiment has a through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>that protrudes through the turbine hub <b>100</b> in the axial direction.

Therefore, assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> can be checked by the relative positional relationship of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>and the thrust bearing <b>110</b>. That is, when a portion of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is not covered by a portion of the thrust bearing <b>110</b>, it can be determined that either the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is not assembled or that it was assembled improperly. That is, a torque converter <b>14</b> in which assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> can be easily checked can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also, the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>may be an oil hole for transferring hydraulic fluid. Therefore, assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> can be easily checked using an oil hole formed in the turbine hub <b>100</b> as part of the third oil path <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the thrust bearing <b>110</b> includes the plurality of rollers <b>111</b>, which are aligned in the radial direction and separated by predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction, and the pair of disc-shaped thrust bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> that sandwich the plurality of rollers <b>111</b>. Assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> can be easily checked using a practical structure because the inner peripheral edge portion of the thrust bearing race <b>117</b>, which contacts the turbine <b>100</b>, from among the pair of thrust bearing races <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>, is shaped to cover a portion of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, when the turbine hub <b>100</b> is assembled onto the torque converter <b>14</b>, assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is checked by checking whether the pin <b>136</b>, having radial dimensions enabling it to be inserted through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>, can be inserted at least a predetermined amount through that through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>. If a portion of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is not covering a portion of the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>, the pin <b>136</b> is able to protrude through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>. Thus, if the pin <b>136</b> protrudes through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>, it means that either the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is not assembled or that it was not assembled properly. That is, a method for easily checking the assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> of the torque converter <b>14</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While example embodiments of the invention have been described in detail with reference to the drawings, the invention is not limited to these example embodiments. To the contrary, the invention may be carried out in other modes as well.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in the foregoing example embodiment, the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>functions as an oil hole for transferring hydraulic fluid. The invention is not limited to this, however. That is, a through-hole that does not particularly serve as an oil hole and that is formed in the turbine hub <b>100</b> may also be used to check assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, in the foregoing example embodiments, an example was given in which assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> is checked by checking whether the pin <b>136</b> having radial dimensions enabling it to be inserted through the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>is able to be inserted through that through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>while the turbine hub <b>100</b> is assembled onto the torque converter <b>14</b>. Alternatively, however, the overlapping portion of the thrust-bearing race <b>117</b>, with respect to the through-hole <b>100</b><i>h</i>, may be checked visually or optically and assembly of the thrust bearing <b>110</b> may be checked visually by a person or optically by a machine.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, although not particularly mentioned in the foregoing example embodiments, it is sufficient that at least one through-hole <b>100</b><i>h </i>be provided, i.e., it is not absolutely necessary that a plurality of the through-holes <b>100</b><i>h </i>be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The invention is also intended to cover various other modifications and equivalent arrangements. In addition, while the various elements of the exemplary embodiments are shown in various combinations and configurations, which are exemplary, other combinations and configurations, including more, less or only a single element, are also within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
