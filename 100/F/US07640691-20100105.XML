<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to issues associated with urban combat where acquisition and engagement of potential targets often requires close-in viewing and aiming in building interiors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, a weapon, such as a rifle, may have a scope that enables a user to scan an objective area or target area and engage targets while viewing the target through the scope. Unfortunately, these scopes or gun sights required the user to look through the scope by placing the user's eye at or near the end of the scope and looking through the scope at the target. While doing so, the user exposed himself to direct adversary fire when he was using the scope to view, locate and engage a target.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of optical systems have been used as sighting systems on weapons. Examples of such optical systems can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,202 Mladjan et al. and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,749,271 by Nagler. Other U.S. references of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,346,995; 5,189,555; 6,490,060; and 6,643,969.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is an improved sighting system which enables an alignment and aim the weapon for firing at the target while concealed and protected from such return fire by, for example, a wall of a building.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention positions an optical beam splitting element, which can be rotated around a centerline of a pointing axis of the weapon. The beamsplitter is sealed in an optical housing containing other optical elements in which part or all of the elements can rotate with the beamsplitter. The beamsplitter splits the incoming optical path, giving the viewer dual sighting capabilities and allowing him to aim from either the rear of the weapon or from an adjustable side position of the weapon. The side aiming position can be adjusted by pivoting or rotating the beamsplitter assembly around a pointing axis of the device so that the user can aim at a variety of side, overhead or underneath positions. In a rifle or gun scope application, the beamsplitter is positioned behind the targeting reticle and therefore, the aim point of impact is not compromised by small misalignments of the rotating beamsplitting element. In addition, when the dual sight is coupled or situated adjacent to a conventional gun sight, any unlimited eye relief inherent in the sight affords greater flexibility in accommodating the position of the gunner's eye relative to the rear and side viewing ports or positions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sight device, when mounted on small caliber weapons, will allow a gunner to scan an objective or target area and engage targets around corners or over obstacles, quickly and accurately. The intended result is that the user of the sight can see the target and its surroundings in a line or aim point such as a red dot or similar reticle, for firing at a target while concealed and protected from return fire. The sight may be provided with a quick release mount that is compatible with standard gun mounting rails and can be interfaced with red dot, holographic and other types of sighting devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved sighting device that enables viewing a target from rear and side positions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object is to provide a penta prism beamsplitter that enables viewing a target from multiple positions associated with a weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to provide a sight that enables side and rear views of a target wherein the image of the target is not inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the invention is to provide a sight that can be situated in a detached, but proximate relation to, a scope on a weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the invention is to provide a sight system and method that enables a user to obtain a view of a target from a position other than the rear of the weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another object of the invention is to provide an adjustable optical element whose position may be adjusted to enable a viewing axis or position to be adjusted such that a user can view the target, from positions other than the rear of the sight.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect this invention comprises a sight comprising a connector for mounting the sight to a weapon, a housing coupled to the connector, the housing having a plurality of windows through which a target may be viewed, and an optical element situated in the housing for receiving a beam in one of the plurality of windows and for splitting the beam into a plurality of optical paths associated with the plurality of windows, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect this invention comprises a sight for use on a weapon having a scope, the sight comprising a housing comprising a first window, a second window generally opposed to the first window, and at least one third window, an optical element situated in the housing in operative relationship with the first, second and third windows, the optical element comprising at least one beamsplitter, and a connector for detachably coupling the housing in operative relationship with the scope, the first window being generally opposed to the second window for permitting a direct line of sight of a target through the optical element, and the optical element permitting at least one third window to cooperate with at least one of the first window or the second window to permit a side or right angle view of the target from a position displaced from the direct line of sight of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still another aspect, this invention comprises sight for use on a weapon, the sight comprising an optical element comprising a beamsplitter for mounting on the weapon, the optical element permitting a first view of a target along a first axis and frame, a first viewing area and a second view of the target along a second axis and frame a second viewing area, the second axis being situated at an angle relative to the first axis and a connector for coupling the optical element to the weapon, the connector permitting the optical element to rotate to permit a position of the second view to be changed, while the sight pointing direction remaining substantially the same</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another aspect, this invention comprises weapon sight prism for use on a weapon comprising a body comprising a plurality of sides, a beamsplitter integrally formed in the body, a mirror surface formed on the body, the beamsplitter and the mirror surface cooperating to provide a plurality of viewing areas for viewing a non-inverted image of a target.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In still another aspect, this invention comprises a sight for use on a weapon or sighting device having a scope, the sight comprising: a housing comprising a plurality of viewing areas, an optical element situated in the housing in operative relationship with the plurality of viewing areas, the optical element comprising at least one beamsplitter, and a connector for detachably coupling the housing to the weapon and in operative relationship with the scope, the plurality of viewing areas and the optical element permitting a view of the target from a rear position of the weapon and a side view of the target from a side position of the weapon.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a first embodiment of the invention is shown. In this embodiment, a weapon <b>10</b> is held by a user and has a sight <b>12</b> that enables a user to view a target from a plurality of different positions, such as a right side position of the weapon <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a left side position of the weapon <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or numerous other positions therebetween. The sight <b>12</b> has a rear window or port, described later herein, located at an end <b>12</b><i>a </i>to enable the user to look through the sight <b>12</b> in a traditional rear-view position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sight <b>12</b> is mounted on the weapon <b>16</b> with a connector <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3A</figref>) adjacent scope <b>14</b>. It should be understood that the sight <b>12</b> may be used either with or without the scope <b>14</b>. In the embodiment being illustrated, the sight <b>12</b> has an axis that is generally coaxial with an axis of the scope <b>14</b>. The sight <b>12</b> comprises a housing <b>13</b> that houses an optical element or assembly <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref>). In this embodiment, the optical element or assembly <b>18</b> comprises an elliptical plate beamsplitter <b>19</b> having a first side <b>19</b><i>a</i>, a second side <b>19</b><i>b </i>and a plurality of ports or windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The beamsplitter <b>19</b> which has a 50/50 splitting ratio. Of course, it should be understood that different split ratios may be used to optimize different wave length ranges depending upon the imaging requirements of the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The plurality of ports or windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are received in areas <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively, in a housing wall <b>28</b>. A plurality of locking-ring seals <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are threadably received in mating threads <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3) and 28</figref><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) in a housing wall <b>28</b> that defines the generally T-shaped housing <b>13</b>, retain windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in housing <b>13</b> and seal an interior area <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) within a housing wall <b>28</b> of housing <b>13</b> from moisture, dust and dirt of the type typically encountered in a tactical environment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sight <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be incorporated directly into a riflescope, such as scope <b>14</b>, as one complete unit or constructed separately and added or retrofitted to a weapon using, for example, a detachable mount (not shown), such as a standard machined Picantinny Rail 1913 Mount or similar mount.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the embodiment being described, the windows <b>20</b>-<b>24</b> may be polished glass flats that have anti-scratch and anti-reflection coating on them to avoid unwanted light reflections, and they do not magnify the image. However, the windows <b>20</b>-<b>24</b> could be provided with magnification power if desired. The optical element <b>18</b> is mounted in housing <b>13</b>, and the beamsplitter side <b>19</b><i>a </i>is situated against surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>which orients the beamsplitter <b>19</b> at an approximate 45 degree angle relative to the objective optical path (labeled A<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This arrangement causes incoming light to be split and directed to window <b>24</b>, while some light passes through to window <b>20</b>. The tubular member <b>30</b> has a seat <b>30</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) for receiving and supporting window <b>22</b>. A locking ring <b>37</b> is threadably received in housing <b>13</b> and has an optical seat <b>37</b><i>a </i>is provided for receiving and supporting the window <b>20</b>. The housing wall <b>28</b> has a machined seat <b>28</b><i>e </i>for receiving window <b>24</b>. As mentioned earlier, notice that the windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are secured to housing wall <b>28</b> within housing <b>13</b> using the threaded locking rings <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, which are threadably mounted in the internal mating threads <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>28</b><i>c </i>respectively, in housing wall <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the housing <b>13</b> is rotatable in the direction of double arrow C and about the axis or center line A<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), which allows the user to adjust the non-rear or side aiming position to accommodate viewing a target T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) from different positions or angles relative to axis A<b>1</b> and around different objects, such as a wall. The rotational adjustment of the sight <b>12</b> is accomplished using a connector or connector assembly <b>16</b> which will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref>, the connector <b>16</b> comprises a circular wall member <b>21</b> that receives an integral plug <b>44</b> that has a threaded end <b>44</b><i>a </i>that is threaded into mating threads <b>28</b><i>d </i>at end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of housing <b>28</b>. A bearing <b>46</b>, which may be a plastic ring, is placed over end <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the internal plug <b>44</b> and between a wall <b>44</b><i>b </i>of a flange <b>44</b><i>c </i>and a flange or wall <b>21</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of circular wall member <b>21</b> whereupon plug <b>44</b> may be screwed into housing <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A bearing <b>48</b> is received on a seat <b>44</b><i>d </i>of plug <b>44</b> and the assemblage is rotatably mounted in circular wall member <b>21</b> and held in place by a locking ring <b>50</b>. The bearings <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> allow the plug <b>44</b> to rotate inside the circular wall member <b>21</b> of the connector <b>16</b>. The plug <b>44</b> and housing <b>13</b> to pivot or rotate together about axis A<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) while the circular wall member <b>21</b> of the connector <b>16</b> remains fixed. Although not shown, note that the internal plug <b>44</b> may be fastened or locked to housing <b>13</b> using a set screw (not shown) after plug <b>44</b> is threadably received in housing wall <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned earlier, the connector <b>16</b> may be detachably mounted to the weapon <b>10</b> using a machined mount, such as the Picatinny Rail 1913 mount or similar mount mentioned. Alternatively, the connector <b>16</b> may be mounted on or adjacent to scope <b>14</b>, which may have a similar type of mount and may share the same track or rail on the weapon <b>12</b>. Thus, the optical element <b>18</b> can be separate from scope <b>14</b> and provided as an add-on or retrofit unit that can be situated adjacent to and optically coupled to the scope <b>14</b>, as shown. Alternatively, it could be incorporated into the scope <b>14</b> as one complete unit or constructed separately in the housing <b>13</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The scope <b>14</b> is mounted toward the front of the weapon, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the circular wall member <b>21</b> receiving and covering a portion of the end <b>14</b><i>a </i>of scope <b>14</b> to keep dust and dirt away from the interface between the sight <b>12</b> and scope <b>14</b>. The scope <b>14</b> and sight <b>12</b> may be separated so that there is a gap or distance between the front of the optical housing and the rear of the scope, as will be illustrated later herein relative to another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagrammatic view with various parts and the housing <b>13</b> removed for ease of illustration. Note that two optical axes or pathways, pathways D and E, are created by the 50/50 beamsplitter <b>19</b> to the objective environment <b>54</b> as shown. Note that the beamsplitter <b>19</b> splits an incoming light beam D<b>1</b> into the pathways or axes D and E, thereby enabling viewing or the target T from either a non-rear position, such as a side position <b>56</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>) or a rear view position <b>58</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>), which is similar to a traditional rear-view position. Note that the optical element <b>18</b>, such as beamsplitter <b>19</b> and supporting optical elements <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, are generally positioned behind a targeting or aiming reticle (not shown) within the scope <b>14</b> so that an aim point of impact is not compromised due to small optical element misalignments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As mentioned earlier, the beamsplitter <b>19</b> split ratio is typically designed to be 50/50 so the light transmission is evenly divided between the two optical axes or paths D and E. However, other split ratios can be accommodated by selecting a different type of beamsplitter <b>19</b> or by having, for example, an aluminized or similar coating deposition applied to the optical glass of the beamsplitter <b>19</b> during manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During use, the user may adjust the position of window <b>24</b> by pivoting or rotating it about axis A<b>1</b>, in the direction of double arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to enable the user to view the target from the non-rear position, such as the side positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b> or any position where the user is observing the target T through window <b>24</b> and from a direction that is, for example, generally radial to axis A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be understood that an electronic imaging device may be substituted for the eye in either position <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) and <b>58</b> (i.e., when viewed from the side or rear, respectively of the weapon <b>10</b>). For example, a digital camera may be coupled or operatively associated with the windows <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> if desired. Also, the embodiment may incorporate or be used with night vision, infrared, windage and elevation options of the type previously known</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that the optical path D generally lies in an axis or line that is a direct path or axis through the scope <b>14</b> and toward a target T. In contrast, optical path E is situated at a predetermined angle &#x3b8; relative to the path D and is generally transverse and not co-axial with the optical path D, allowing for multiple viewing positions with a single sight. In the illustration being shown, the predetermined angle is approximately 90 degrees, but it should be appreciated that beamsplitter <b>19</b> may be arranged or positioned within housing <b>13</b> so that the angle &#x3b8; is larger or smaller if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The optical element assembly <b>18</b>, including beamsplitter <b>19</b> and windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, do not magnify the image of target T in the embodiment being described. It should be understood, however, that the optical element <b>18</b> may be provided with magnification capabilities if desired by providing one or more magnifying lenses separate from or integrated into the windows <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and/or beamsplitter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 19</figref>, another embodiment of the invention is shown. In this embodiment, a sight system <b>100</b> is shown comprising a housing <b>102</b> having a wall <b>103</b> having a plurality of threaded openings <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> and <b>109</b> that receive locking rings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, respectively, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>19</b>. The locking rings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> define or are associated with windows W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b>, respectively. The locking rings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are threaded and have O-rings <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>a </i>that are received in channels <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>108</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The purpose and function of the O-ring will be described later herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The housing wall <b>103</b> is made of high strength aluminum and is configured to define a generally polygonal or pentagonal-shaped receiving area <b>122</b> for receiving an optical assembly or element <b>110</b>. The optical assembly or element <b>110</b> comprises a penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> and an optional wedge cap <b>113</b> integrally formed therein in the illustration being described. In the embodiment being described, the optical assembly <b>110</b> is comprised of an optional wedge cap <b>113</b> and a penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> comprising a mirror surface <b>111</b><i>a </i>and beamsplitter surface <b>112</b>. The beamsplitter surface <b>112</b> can be created on a surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>of penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) or on a wedge cap surface <b>113</b><i>b</i>, depending on the construction technique used to make the optical assembly <b>110</b>. However, for purposes of discussion herein, it is assumed that the beamsplitter <b>112</b> is created or provided on surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In the final optical assembly, components <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> are typically bonded together using optical cement.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be understood, however, that the optical assembly <b>110</b> may be provided in separate components and assembled or situated in a similar arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Thus, the optical element <b>110</b> may be provided in a single integral construction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, or the optical sub-components of mirror <b>111</b><i>a</i>, beamsplitter <b>112</b> and wedge cap <b>113</b> can be design to be mounted into the housing <b>102</b> as separate optical components that are placed into area <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). In such an alternate embodiment the beamsplitter <b>112</b> can be created on the wedge cap surface <b>113</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The mirror <b>111</b> a can be a separate optical component that is secured in the housing. Separate optical window elements at surfaces <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> can also be used to seal the interior housing and optics in such an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The complete optical element <b>110</b> functions as a non-inverting optical beamsplitter that simultaneously provides non-inverted images of a target T to windows <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, as will be described in more detail later herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The housing <b>102</b> is an aluminum housing using a kinematic optical mounting technique. The optical element <b>110</b> is received in the area <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and engages mounting pads or areas <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> that are machined into the housing <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, note that each locking ring <b>104</b>-<b>106</b> has the O-rings <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>a </i>that engage surfaces <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>c</i>, and <b>111</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The locking rings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> force penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> against mounting pads <b>121</b> to retain optical element <b>110</b> in a firm and secure position within the housing <b>102</b>. The O-rings <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>a </i>engage and conform to the surfaces <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>c </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>to provide a seal so moisture, dirt or unwanted debris will not enter housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After the optical element <b>110</b> is secured within the housing <b>102</b>, an elastimeric compound or sheet <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), such as a neoprene rubber sheet, is situated on surface <b>111</b><i>d </i>and a lid <b>130</b> is secured to housing <b>102</b>. The compound or sheet <b>124</b> is used to provide a watertight seal of the lid <b>130</b>. The lid <b>130</b> is secured to the housing <b>102</b> with a plurality of screws <b>132</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> for ease of illustration).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 19</figref>, optical element <b>110</b> provides paths J and I that are visible to the user at positions <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, respectively, and that generally correspond to positions associated with the windows W<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and W<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) as shown. Note that the incoming light or optical path Y is received in window W<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and is split by beamsplitter <b>112</b> at the surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>of penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Thus, one component of the light along path Y passes through the prism <b>111</b>, through beamsplitter <b>112</b> and along path or axis J to the user who is situated in proximity to area <b>116</b> and near the window W<b>1</b> associated with locking ring <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). This area <b>116</b> is generally associated with a rear <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The other component of split beam Y, labeled as I in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, is reflected first off of the beamsplitter <b>112</b> on surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>of penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> and then off a mirrored surface <b>111</b><i>a </i>of the penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b>. The reflected light along path I passes through window W<b>2</b> associated with the circular locking ring <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and to the user at area <b>118</b>, which generally corresponds to a side or angled position, such as the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. In the angled or side positions, the user may be situated, for example, adjacent to, on a side, above or below the sight <b>100</b> so that the user's view is generally transverse or radial relative to the path Y.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As mentioned earlier, the beamsplitter <b>112</b> and wedge cap <b>113</b> are integrally formed in the penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> to provide a single, integral optical element <b>110</b>. It should be understood, however, that the optical element <b>110</b> may be constructed or assembled from multiple separate, non-integral components, such as by using one or more of the individual beamsplitter <b>112</b>, penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b>, an individual penta prism (not shown) without a beamsplitter, the wedge <b>113</b>, windows (not shown), and/or one or more separate mirrors (not shown) situated in the general configuration illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although not shown, various surfaces of the components, such as surfaces <b>111</b><i>b </i>and <b>111</b><i>c </i>of penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> and surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>of wedge cap <b>113</b>, may be optically coated with an anti-reflection or anti-scratch deposition or coating to enhance the performance or protection of the optical element <b>110</b>. Notice that the user is viewing the target T through either window W<b>1</b> or W<b>2</b> and that these are the surfaces <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>and <b>111</b><i>c </i>of penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b>, respectively. Thus, separate lens covers are not necessary, although they may be used if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, note that the penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> and beamsplitter <b>112</b> cooperate to receive light along path Y and provide the two optical pathways J and I. Path I is generally transverse to paths Y and J and is situated at a predetermined angle &#x3a6; relative to paths Y and J as shown. In the embodiment shown, the predetermined angle &#x3a6; is on the order of about 90 degrees, but it should be understood that the optical element <b>110</b> incorporating penta prism beamsplitter <b>111</b> may be dimensioned and configured so that the relative angle &#x3a6; between the optical pathways or axes J and I, for example, is any desired angle. Note that the optical pathway J exits through the window W<b>1</b> associated with locking ring <b>104</b> to the area <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 19</figref>) generally associated with the area <b>116</b> or a rear <b>102</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 19</figref>) of the sight <b>100</b>. The optical pathway I exits through window W<b>2</b> defined by locking ring <b>106</b> and is generally associated with the area <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 19</figref>), which generally corresponds to a position where a user is situated other than at the rear of the device, such as the side or adjacent positions and above positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-17</figref>. Viewing from a rear position of the sight <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As with the embodiment described earlier herein, the optical element <b>110</b> enables target viewing from either the side position <b>118</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>) or the rear position <b>116</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The beamsplitter <b>112</b> split ratio in the embodiment being described is approximately 50/50 so that light is substantially evenly divided between the two optical paths I and J (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). It should be understood, however, that other split ratios can be used. Also, coatings, such as mirror and beamsplitter coatings, may be applied to the optical surfaces <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>113</b><i>b</i>, respectively, during manufacturing. Note that axis J is a generally a direct line of sight or view to the target T, whereas the line of sight or axis I is a non-direct line of sight to the target T, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the example being described, the wedge cap <b>113</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) may be provided to support and protect the beamsplitter <b>112</b>. The wedge cap <b>113</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) also provides an air to glass surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) that is generally normal to the axes or line of sight J and Y illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As mentioned earlier, one or more component surfaces, such as the surfaces <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>111</b><i>c</i>, <b>111</b><i>e </i>of prism <b>111</b>, and/or surfaces <b>113</b><i>b</i>,<b>113</b><i>a </i>of wedge <b>113</b>, may comprise an anti-reflection coating or filter to reduce unwanted light reflections or light (such as UV light).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>19</b>, the sight <b>100</b> further includes a connector assembly or connector <b>134</b> that is coupled to the housing <b>102</b> and permits the housing <b>102</b>, optical element <b>110</b>, and windows W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> to rotate or pivot about an axis A<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). This enables, for example, the position of window W<b>2</b> to be changed relative to axis A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The connector assembly <b>134</b> comprises a circular portion <b>136</b> that is mounted on a conventional quick-release mount <b>138</b>. In the embodiment being described, the quick-release mount <b>138</b> comprises a lever <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that may be manually actuated to quickly and detachably release the connector <b>134</b> from a rail or track, such as the track <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), on which a scope <b>164</b> is mounted. The housing <b>102</b> is rotatably mounted to the connector <b>134</b> in a manner that will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The connector <b>134</b> comprises an internal circular sleeve or plug <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). A plastic bearing <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref>) is received on plug <b>144</b> and is situated between a wall <b>136</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) of circular portion <b>136</b> and a flange wall <b>144</b><i>b </i>of a flange <b>144</b><i>c </i>of plug <b>144</b>. Another bearing <b>148</b> is situated on a seat <b>144</b><i>e </i>and engages surface <b>144</b><i>d </i>of flange <b>144</b><i>c</i>. A washer <b>150</b> is situated between the bearing <b>148</b> and a locking ring <b>152</b> as shown. The locking ring <b>152</b> is threadably received in the threaded aperture <b>136</b><i>b </i>of circular portion <b>136</b> to rotatably retain the plug <b>144</b> and the various components, such as the plug <b>144</b>, bearings <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and washer <b>150</b> within the connector <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>, the threaded portion <b>144</b><i>f </i>of plug <b>144</b> projects through the opening <b>136</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) of circular portion <b>136</b>. Note that the plug <b>144</b> is free to rotate between the bearings <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> within connector <b>134</b> and about the axis A<b>2</b>. The threaded portion <b>144</b><i>f </i>threadably receives the threads <b>109</b> of housing <b>102</b>, thereby connecting the housing <b>102</b> to the rotatable plug <b>144</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Because the plug <b>144</b> is not fixed and is free to rotate within circular portion <b>136</b> about the axis A<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref>), the housing <b>102</b> is also free to rotate. An set screw, such as set screw <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), is mounted through housing <b>102</b> and into the threaded aperture <b>162</b> in order to lock or fix the housing <b>102</b> relative to the rotatable plug <b>134</b>. Thus, the plug <b>144</b> is coupled to and permits or enables the housing <b>102</b> to rotate about the axis A<b>2</b>, which generally corresponds to an axis or direct line of sight to the target T. This means that the position of the optical element <b>110</b> and the position of the window W<b>2</b> associated with locking ring <b>106</b> is also capable of pivoting or rotating about the axis A<b>2</b>, which generally corresponds to the direct line of sight to the target T when viewed through the window W<b>1</b> associated with locking ring <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">After the system <b>100</b> is assembled and the housing <b>102</b> is coupled to the connector <b>134</b>, the sight <b>100</b> may be detachably mounted to the track <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) using the quick-release disconnect mount <b>138</b>. The quick-release disconnect mount <b>138</b> may be any conventional mount, such as the Picatinny Rail 1913 mount or any equivalent thereof. In the embodiment being described, the sight <b>100</b> is not mounted directly to the scope <b>164</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), but rather, is situated a predetermined distance GD behind the scope as desired by the user to optimizing viewing geometry and satisfy mounting constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the embodiment being described, the optical element <b>110</b> has zero optical power and an unlimited eye relief and does not magnify the target scene (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). This is desirable when the sight <b>100</b> is mounted on the weapon and interfaced to a unity optical power scope, such as a 1&#xd7; rifle scope, with a similar unlimited eye relief. The embodiment is designed to work efficiently in combination with various unity magnification rifle scopes with red dot or holographic reticles. Representative examples of such rifle scopes are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,346,995; 5,189,555; and 6,490,060, all of which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the embodiment being described, the system <b>100</b> can be used and interfaced with-riflescopes or to a conventional rear peep sight (not shown) to provide a reticle (not shown) or it may be provided with its own reticle (not shown), such as a laser or red dot or holographic reticle. One advantage of the invention is that there is no need to adjust eye relief using additional lenses in the embodiment because unity optical devices allows for unlimited eye relief. However, to support magnified viewing of target scene T from the rear and/or side ports or windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, respectively, optical lenses or mirrors could be incorporated or used to correctly position the eye pupil to a fixed user eye point location in each optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Also, additional imaging objects incorporating a reticle, magnification, night vision, windage and elevation adjustment units and/or an electronic imaging device <b>200</b>, such as the digital camera referred to earlier herein relative to the first example, may be used to provide for precise imaging and aiming at the target T. As with the embodiment being described earlier herein relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, this embodiment is also designed to work efficiently in combination with unity magnification scopes having, for example, laser, red dot or holographic reticle. Also, electronic imaging devices (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), such as a digital camera, may be substituted for the eye and associated with one or more of the windows <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> if desired. The invention may be used or incorporate night vision and/or laser sighting system capabilities as well. It should be understood, that additional lenses and optics can be incorporated into the optical housing <b>102</b>, the windows <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> to support magnified viewing of the target scene T and to properly adjust exit pupil and focal distances. Also, additional imaging objects such as a reticle, magnification, laser sighting, range finding, night vision, windage and elevation adjustment units and/or an electronic imaging device may be integrated directly into the invention to provide a multifunctional device with extended capability.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>18</b>, rotational adjustment of the optical element <b>110</b> is accomplished by a user simply adjusting the position of the housing <b>102</b> in the direction of double arrow H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Thus, the user can position the window W<b>2</b> to the desired viewing position, such as the side position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or the above-sight position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In this regard, as the user rotates the housing <b>102</b>, the plug <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 11</figref>) to which it is coupled rotates within the circular portion <b>136</b> of connector <b>134</b>. While the bearings <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> permit this rotational movement, the locking ring <b>152</b> is tightened to a predetermined torque such that the housing <b>102</b> is retained in the position selected by the user. Although not shown, a lock may also be provided to lock the housing <b>102</b> relative to the connector <b>134</b> after the user has adjusted it to the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">During operation, the user views the target T through either the window W<b>1</b> or window W<b>2</b>. Light passes along path Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), through the window W<b>3</b>, and the optical path Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is split into the axes or paths J and I at the surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>as described earlier. The component J of the light passes through the window W<b>1</b> and to the area <b>116</b> if, for example, the user is viewing the target T from the rear of the sight <b>100</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. As secondary reflection of the incoming light is reflected off surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and off mirror surface <b>111</b><i>a </i>before passing through the window W<b>2</b> and to the area <b>118</b> generally associated with a side or non-rear position of the weapon <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. Note that the secondary reflection off of mirrored surface <b>111</b><i>a </i>eliminates the inversion that occurs when the incoming light is reflected off surface <b>111</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Thus, the sight <b>100</b> provides non-inverted images of the target T when viewed through the windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As alluded to earlier herein, the locking rings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> have no additional lenses, optical features or windows. However, it should be understood that these openings or windows <b>104</b>-<b>108</b> may also contain other optics or lenses depending upon the specific imaging requirements of the sight <b>100</b> and the environment in which it is being used. Also, the sight may be detachably mounted to weapon <b>10</b> or provided in a storage pouch (not shown) for quick retrieval and mounting when desired. Also, in view of the various positions that may be achieved using the sight <b>100</b>, a sling <b>165</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>) may be provided and used to stabilize the weapon <b>10</b> and sight <b>100</b> during shooting. The sling <b>165</b> facilitates minimizing the need for the user to support and stabilize the weapon <b>10</b> and helps to absorb the recoil energy during firing.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Advantageously, the position of housing <b>102</b> is adjustable and the position of the window W<b>2</b> can be adjusted, pivoted or rotated about the center line or axis A<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) or the pointing axis of the sight <b>100</b> so that the target T can be viewed through the window <b>106</b> at a plurality of non-rear positions, side positions, off-axis positions, above or below sight positions or any position in the direction of double arrow H (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), while approximately maintaining angle &#x3a6; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Note that the user maintains the ability to see the target T through the rear window W<b>1</b> associated with locking ring <b>104</b> at any time. Thus, it should be appreciated that when the sight <b>100</b> is mounted on the weapon <b>10</b>, the user can view target T down the target line, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, or from a non-rear, side, above or below weapon <b>10</b> position which are forward of the rear position, such as when the user is pointing the weapon at the target T while the user himself is positioned above or below a protective barrier, such as a wall of a building.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">While the invention has been described with reference to certain specific embodiments, this description is merely illustrative, and is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Various other modifications and changes may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
