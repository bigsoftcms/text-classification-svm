<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional air nozzle for an automatically inflatable air cushion in accordance with the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> comprises a mounting seat <b>30</b> mounted on an automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b> containing a packing <b>311</b>, a connecting pipe <b>10</b> having a first end mounted on the mounting seat <b>30</b> by ratchet teeth <b>16</b> and limit bosses <b>15</b>, a mediate portion formed with an outer thread <b>14</b> and a second end formed with a mounting portion <b>12</b> having an inside formed with an annular passage <b>13</b> connected to the mounting seat <b>30</b>, a control cap <b>20</b> rotatably mounted on the connecting pipe <b>10</b> and having an inside formed with an inner thread <b>24</b> screwed onto the outer thread <b>14</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> and an end face <b>21</b> provided with a protruding seal portion <b>23</b> that is movable to seal the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, and a gasket <b>11</b> mounted in the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> to press the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> when the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is inserted into the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>. The connecting pipe <b>10</b> has an inside formed with an air chamber <b>101</b> connected between the mounting seat <b>30</b> and the passage <b>13</b>. The control cap <b>20</b> has an inside formed with an air channel <b>25</b> connected to the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> when the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is detached from the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>. The end face <b>21</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> has a peripheral wall formed with a plurality of air vents <b>22</b> connected to the air channel <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In practice, the inner thread <b>24</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is screwed onto the outer thread <b>14</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, so that when the control cap <b>20</b> is rotated relative to the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is movable relative to the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>. Thus, the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is movable to detach from the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> to open a connection between the air channel <b>25</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> and the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, so that an air from the ambient environment is in turn introduced through the air vents <b>22</b> of the control cap <b>20</b>, the air channel <b>25</b> of the control cap <b>20</b>, the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, the air chamber <b>101</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> and the mounting seat <b>30</b> into the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b> so as to inflate the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b> automatically. On the contrary, the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> is movable to seal the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> to interrupt the connection between the air channel <b>25</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> and the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, so as to stop the air flow into the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the user needs to rotate the control cap <b>20</b> successively to move the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> to detach from the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> so as to open the air flow or to move the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> to seal the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> so as to close the air flow, thereby causing inconvenience to the user when operating the air nozzle. In addition, after inflation of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b>, the user needs to rotate the control cap <b>20</b> successively to move the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> to seal the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b> to close the air flow, so that the air easily leaks from the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>31</b> before the seal portion <b>23</b> of the control cap <b>20</b> reaches and seals the passage <b>13</b> of the connecting pipe <b>10</b>, thereby decreasing the inflating effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a oneway valve, comprising a valve body having a first end formed with an air inlet port and a second end formed with an air outlet port, a valve seat mounted in the valve body to separate the air inlet port from the air outlet port of the valve body and formed with a plurality of conducting holes each connected to the air inlet port and the air outlet port of the valve body to connect the air inlet port to the air outlet port of the valve body, and a valve stem movably mounted in the air inlet port of the valve body and movable to seal the conducting holes of the valve seat to interrupt a connection between the air inlet port and the air outlet port of the valve body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a oneway valve that prevents the air from leaking from the automatically inflatable air cushion during the inflation process and prevents the air from entering the automatically inflatable air cushion during the deflation process, so that the automatically inflatable air cushion is inflated and deflated completely and exactly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a oneway valve that is locked and unlocked exactly by a pressure differential to prevent the air from flowing back during the inflation and deflation processes, thereby enhancing the inflation and deflation efficiency of the automatically inflatable air cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a careful reading of the detailed description with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to the drawings and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a oneway valve <b>40</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a valve body <b>41</b> having a first end formed with an air inlet port <b>411</b> and a second end formed with an air outlet port <b>412</b>, a valve seat <b>413</b> mounted in the valve body <b>41</b> to separate the air inlet port <b>411</b> from the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> and formed with a plurality of conducting holes <b>4132</b> each connected to the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> to connect the air inlet port <b>411</b> to the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, and a valve stem <b>42</b> movably mounted in the air inlet port <b>411</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> and movable to seal the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to interrupt a connection between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The valve body <b>41</b> is a hollow body and has a substantially cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The valve seat <b>413</b> is integrally combined with the valve body <b>41</b>. The valve seat <b>413</b> is mounted in a mediate portion of the valve body <b>41</b> and located between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>. The valve seat <b>413</b> is formed with a through hole <b>4131</b> which is located at a central portion of the valve seat <b>413</b>. The through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> has a substantially circular shape. The conducting holes <b>4132</b> are formed in a peripheral wall of the valve seat <b>413</b> and are enclosed around the through hole <b>4131</b>. The conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> are arranged in an annular manner and are equally spaced from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A piston rod <b>421</b> is movably mounted in the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> and has a first end secured to the valve stem <b>42</b> and a second end formed with a radially and outwardly extending limit boss <b>422</b> movable in the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>. The limit boss <b>422</b> of the piston rod <b>421</b> is movable to rest on the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to prevent the piston rod <b>421</b> from being detached from the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b>. The limit boss <b>422</b> of the piston rod <b>421</b> has a substantially spherical shape and has a diameter greater than that of the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b>. The piston rod <b>421</b> is made of a resilient and flexible material, such as a silicone, plastic or rubber material, so that the limit boss <b>422</b> of the piston rod <b>421</b> is compressed radially and inwardly to pass through the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The valve stem <b>42</b> has a substantially disk shape and has a diameter greater than that of the through hole <b>4131</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b>. The valve stem <b>42</b> is integrally combined with the first end of the piston rod <b>421</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The oneway valve <b>40</b> further comprises a connecting strap <b>43</b> made of a flexible material having a first end attached to the valve body <b>41</b> and a second end attached to a mounting ring <b>44</b>. The first end of the connecting strap <b>43</b> is attached to the mediate portion of the valve body <b>41</b> and located between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>. The mounting ring <b>44</b> is mounted on an air nozzle <b>51</b> of an automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b> to attach the oneway valve <b>40</b> to the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the air inlet port <b>411</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> is mounted on and connected to the air nozzle <b>51</b> of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b>. Thus, when an air flow is blown through the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> and toward the valve seat <b>413</b> (or the piston rod <b>421</b> is pressed toward the valve seat <b>413</b>), the valve stem <b>42</b> is pushed outwardly relative to the valve seat <b>413</b> by the push force of the air flow to detach from the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to open the connection between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, so that the air from the ambient environment is in turn introduced through the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b>, the air inlet port <b>411</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> and the air nozzle <b>51</b> into the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so as to inflate the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the pressure in the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> is greater than that of the ambient environment after a full inflation of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>, the valve stem <b>42</b> is pushed toward the valve seat <b>413</b> by the push force of the air pressure of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> to seal the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to interrupt the connection between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> so as to lock the oneway valve, thereby preventing the air from leaking from the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>, so that the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> is inflated completely and exactly.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> is mounted on and connected to the air nozzle <b>51</b> of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b>. Thus, when the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b> is compressed, the valve stem <b>42</b> is pushed outwardly relative to the valve seat <b>413</b> by the push force of the air in the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b> to detach from the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to open the connection between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, so that the air in the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>50</b> is in turn introduced through the air nozzle <b>51</b>, the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> and the air inlet port <b>411</b> of the valve body <b>41</b>, and is drained outwardly from the air inlet port <b>411</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> so as to deflate the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the pressure in the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> is smaller than that of the ambient environment after a full deflation of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>, the valve stem <b>42</b> is pushed toward the valve seat <b>413</b> by the push force of the air pressure of the ambient environment to seal the conducting holes <b>4132</b> of the valve seat <b>413</b> to interrupt the connection between the air inlet port <b>411</b> and the air outlet port <b>412</b> of the valve body <b>41</b> so as to lock the oneway valve, thereby preventing the air from entering the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>, so that the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> is deflated completely and exactly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the oneway valve prevents the air from leaking from the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> during the inflation process and prevents the air from entering the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> during the deflation process, so that the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b> is inflated and deflated completely and exactly. In addition, the oneway valve is locked and unlocked exactly by a pressure differential to prevent the air from flowing back during the inflation and deflation processes, thereby enhancing the inflation and deflation efficiency of the automatically inflatable air cushion <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment(s) as mentioned above, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is, therefore, contemplated that the appended claim or claims will cover such modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the invention.</p>
