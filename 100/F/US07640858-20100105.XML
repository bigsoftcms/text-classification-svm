<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a flare pellet assembly for generating visual and/or infrared energy output, and to methods of making and using the same. The flare pellet assembly generally includes a stack of flare pellets, the individual pellets of which may exhibit an at least generally tapering geometry. These flare pellets may be stacked in a manner that substantially prevents motion of one flare pellet relative to another flare pellet. This stacked arrangement of the flare pellets, along with one or more grooves that may be defined in and/or between adjacent flare pellets, may be said to at least generally enable the resultant flare pellet assembly to provide one or both infrared and visual energy output that reaches desired countermeasure energy output specifications without sacrificing structural integrity of the flare pellet assembly.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to decoy flares and, more particularly to a new pellet design and arrangement for countermeasure flares and other pyrotechnic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flare assemblies have been and continue to be utilized in various manners as defensive countermeasures. For instance, what may be characterized as &#x201c;visual&#x201d; flash flares have been utilized to at least generally distract, startle, and/or &#x201c;throw off&#x201d; a person responsible for guiding and/or aiming a missile, such as a laser guided missile, at an object, such as a tank or an airplane. A general premise behind these visual flash flares is that enough light in the visual wavelengths will be emitted via ignition of the associated payload that a person responsible for guiding and/or aiming a missile cannot help but be distracted by the magnitude of light produced. As one might expect from the magnitude of the desired output intensity, these visual flash flares typically exhibit a burn time of no more than about a couple seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional visual flash flares have typically included an ejectable payload made up of a loose or loosely packed, ignitable, granular composition. This granular payload composition has become undesirable for numerous reasons. For instance, low packing density exhibited by the granular compositions, inherent in some conventional visual flash flares, may result in to low energy density of the flare. As another detriment, transportation and storage of these types of flares may be expensive and has provided undesired detonation problems. These drawbacks, as well as others, seem to have made military units reluctant to employ these types of visual flash flare devices on board their aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other prior art flare assemblies may be utilized to distract or &#x201c;confuse&#x201d; an infrared guided missile's guidance system into locking in on the infrared light from the flare assembly rather than the exhaust/plume of an aircraft. In this manner, flare assemblies have been utilized to decoy infrared guided missiles at least generally away from an aircraft. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref> illustrate an example of a prior art flare pellet <b>20</b> utilized in infrared flare assemblies. These flare assemblies typically include one, and only one, flare pellet <b>20</b> that is generally press-formed to exhibit slightly smaller dimensions than the fully assembled flare. That is, the pellet <b>20</b> generally has a length <b>21</b>, width <b>22</b>, and depth (or thickness) <b>24</b> that is slightly smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the fully assembled flare. Eight longitudinal grooves <b>26</b> are defined in the outer surface <b>28</b> of the pellet <b>20</b> and run at least generally parallel to a longitudinal reference axis <b>23</b> of the pellet <b>20</b>. These grooves <b>26</b> are generally included to increase an initial surface area of the flare pellet <b>20</b> for ease of igniting and to generally control the energy output of the flare pellet <b>20</b> upon ignition. However, the design of this flare pellet <b>20</b> has not provided desired output energy versus burn time performance when used in conjunction with certain spectrally balanced infrared flare formulations. That is, the flare pellet <b>20</b> has provided burn times that are longer than desired and energy outputs that are less than desired. This due, at least in significant part, to the flare pellet exhibiting a greater web than desired. Herein, &#x201c;web&#x201d; generally refers to a distance between the outer surface <b>28</b> of the pellet <b>20</b> and a portion of the pellet <b>20</b> which is generally found to be the last portion to burn. For example, a web of the pellet <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref> may refer to a distance <b>25</b> between a trough of the groove <b>26</b><i>a </i>and a lateral reference axis <b>27</b>. To provide an idea of the web magnitude of the pellet <b>20</b>, this distance <b>25</b> has generally been about 0.25 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Past attempts to modify the design of the flare pellet <b>20</b> to increase its initial surface area and/or to decrease the magnitude of the web, with the goal of increasing its peak output energy level and reducing its burn time, have resulted in flare pellets having insufficient structural integrity resulting in fragmenting and/or breaking of the pellet <b>20</b> during normal launch, flight movement/vibration. For instance, holes have been drilled in various flare pellets to increase their surface area and, thus, the peak energy output of the flare pellets. However, these designs have broken apart or collapsed upon having an appropriate ejection force imposed thereon and/or have jammed in the flare launcher. Accordingly, these past attempts have provided insufficient and inconsistent results.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Developments in infrared guided missile technology have enabled guidance systems of missiles to discriminate and reject spectral signatures of some conventional flare assemblies utilized in defensive countermeasures. Any detected spectral signal in which the band intensities and/or band ratios do not conform to a particular target aircraft's distinctive signature would be &#x201c;ignored&#x201d; by the missile's guidance system. Accordingly, it is beneficial to provide countermeasure flares capable of providing a spectral signature similar to that of aircraft desired to be defended. To date, certain energetic compositions of spectrally balanced flare assemblies do not burn fast enough to give the desired results. Conventional approaches have not successfully reformulated the compositions to be faster burning without sacrificing spectral balance, structural integrity, safe storage, and/or safe transport.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example of a conventional flare is what may be referred to as a standard illumination flare assembly that includes a single cast or pressed flare pellet that has and outside circumference and one end inhibited from burning. These flare pellets are generally ignited on one end and burn from end-to-end. These types of standard illumination flare assemblies typically have burn times that are an order of magnitude higher than decoy flares, typically ranging from tens of seconds to one or more minutes. However, in exchange for the length of the burn time, these flares typically do not exhibit sufficient magnitudes of visual light output to distract weapons operators.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a flare pellet geometry that will safely, with good physical integrity, yield faster (e.g., shorter) burn times and higher peak output levels with any given flare composition in any given form factor than any prior art pressed, extruded, or cast flare pellet. These attributes are achieved without the negative attributes (e.g., hazards) associated with the use of granular or powdered compositions, which are known to have been used in lieu of pressed, cast, or extruded flare pellets. These attributes are achievable with a variety of pyrotechnic flare compositions such as visual flare compositions, conventional magnesium/polytetrafluoroethylene infrared flare compositions, spectrally balanced infrared flare compositions, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Herein, the term &#x201c;flare pellet geometry&#x201d; generally refers to a stacked arrangement of the pellets that make up the entire flare pellet as well as the individual pellets that make up the pellet stack assembly. Accordingly, &#x201c;flare pellet geometry,&#x201d; as applied to prior art flare pellets, includes the entire pressed, cast or extruded flare pellet including all of its surface features. &#x201c;Flare pellet geometry&#x201d; may refer to the dimensional features of the unit load pyrotechnic and especially those features that make up the initial combustible surfaces of the unit load pyrotechnic.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide a flare pellet assembly that does not degrade desired spectral signatures. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a flare pellet assembly that is capable of maintaining structural integrity throughout normal flight movement and/or vibrations as well as normal ejection forces. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a flare pellet assembly that is capable of being tailored to replicate an exhaust plume of any of a number of appropriate aircraft. These objectives, as well as others, may be met by the countermeasure system and related methods herein described.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a flare pellet assembly for use in a defensive countermeasure. This flare pellet assembly generally includes at a plurality of ignitable flare pellets that are arranged in a stack. This stacked arrangement of the flare pellets, along with one or more grooves that may be defined in and/or between adjacent flare pellets, at least generally enable the resultant flare pellet assembly to provide one or both infrared and visual output that reach desired countermeasure specifications. Moreover, this stacking of the individual flare pellets enables the resultant flare pellet assembly to structurally withstand normal in flight vibration as well as ejection forces such as those forces imposed on the flare pellet assembly when ejected from a flare launcher system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These flare pellets of the invention may exhibit any appropriate geometric shape. For instance, one or more of the flare pellets may be substantially disk shaped. Further, the flare pellets may exhibit any appropriate design/configuration. As another example, one or more of the flare pellets may exhibit a frustum of a cone or pyramid as well as other appropriate configurations. Yet further, the flare pellets may have any appropriate dimensions. For instance, one or more of the flare pellets may include a thickness of about 0.225 inch, a length of about 1.88 inch, and/or a width of about 0.845 inch. In the case that at least one of the flare pellets is substantially disk shaped, the flare pellet(s) may have a thickness of about 0.30 inch and/or a diameter of about 1.98 inch. While numerous designs, shapes, and dimensions of the flare pellets of the flare pellet assembly may be appropriate, it is preferred that the individual flare pellets are substantially identical in size and general design. Moreover, while some embodiments of the flare pellet may be compatible with a number of appropriate form factors, preferred embodiments of the flare pellet assembly are compatible with at least one of a 1&#xd7;1&#xd7;8 inch form factor, a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 inch form factor, a 2&#xd7;2.5&#xd7;8 inch form factor, a 55 mm diameter form factor, and a 36 mm form factor. Incidentally, a &#x201c;form factor&#x201d; is a term of art generally referring to a compatibility between flare pellet assemblies and flare casings or flare assemblies and dispensing systems. For example, a flare pellet assembly and a flare casing having the same form factor can be used together.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One family of embodiments of the flare pellet assembly may be characterized by having first and second flare pellets that are substantially immobilized relative to each other. For instance, in one embodiment, the first and second flare pellets may be at least generally affixed to each other using an appropriate adhesive and/or mechanical fastener(s). In another embodiment, the first and second flare pellets may be at least generally keyed to each other. In other words, the flare pellets may have at least generally complimentarily surfaces including lands and/or grooves configured to engage each other. This keyed design of the flare pellets at least generally fosters an immobilization of the flare pellets relative to each other in at least one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The flare pellet assembly, at least in one family of embodiments, may be said to include a rod or beam that extends through a plurality of the flare pellets. In this family of embodiments, rotation of one or more of the flare pellets relative to the rod may be restricted, and preferably, substantially prevented. For instance, the flare pellet(s) of one embodiment may be affixed to the rod in any of a number of appropriate manners, such as by employing an appropriate adhesive. Another embodiment may have at least one protrusion associated with either the rod or the flare pellet(s) and a recess, complimentarily configured to accommodate the protrusion, associated with the other of the rod and the flare pellet(s). Incidentally, it should be noted that other embodiments may have a rod that includes both a protrusion and a recess, and the flare pellet(s) may also have a protrusion and a recess complimentarily configured to engage and/or be engaged by the protrusion and recess associated with the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some flare pellet assemblies including a rod may be equipped with a stop of sorts, such as a head, at one end and threading at the other end thereof. The flare pellet assembly may also include a threaded fastener engaged with the threading of the second end of the rod. In this arrangement, it may be said that a plurality of the flare pellets are at least generally disposed between the stop of the rod and the threaded fastener. This arrangement at least generally facilitates a maintenance of the stacked configuration of the flare pellets of the flare pellet assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a flare pellet assembly that includes a flare pellet having a longitudinal reference axis and made of at least one ignitable material. Moreover, at least one tapered groove is defined in the flare pellet and at least generally tapers toward the longitudinal reference axis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The tapered groove(s) of the flare pellet may include an interior angle of between about 5&#xb0; and about 35&#xb0;. So, for instance, the tapered groove(s) may have an interior angle of about 10&#xb0; in one embodiment and about 20&#xb0; in another embodiment. The tapered groove(s) may have any of a variety of appropriate arrangements. For example, the tapered groove(s) may be annularly disposed about the longitudinal reference axis. In at least one embodiment, the flare pellet may be said to include first and second flare pellets. In such an embodiment, the tapered groove may be defined between the first and second flare pellets.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of using a flare assembly, such as a visual flash flare assembly. In this method, a pellet assembly is ejected from a flare assembly. This pellet assembly generally is made up of an ignitable material that includes between about 40% and about 70% magnesium, between about 20% and about 50% sodium nitrate, and may optionally include plastic binder material such as Laminac&#x2122;. In addition to ejection of the pellet assembly, the pellet assembly is ignited, and a visual light output reaching at least about 5.0 million candela is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An infrared output of the pellet assembly may reach at least about 14,000 w/ster (watts per steradian) in the short infrared band (e.g., an infrared band between about 1.811 and about 0.3&#x3bc;), and/or at least about 22,000 w/ster in the mid infrared band (e.g., an infrared band between about 3.0&#x3bc; and about 5.5&#x3bc;). Incidentally, &#x201c;reach&#x201d; or the like herein generally means to meet or exceed a value or magnitude. In one embodiment, the pellet assembly may have a first infrared output that reaches at least about 10,000 w/ster in the short infrared band and a second infrared output in the mid infrared band.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of using a flare assembly, such as an infrared flash flare assembly. In this method, a pellet assembly made from an ignitable material that includes magnesium, polytetrafluoroethylene, and a fluoroelastomer, is ejected from a flare assembly and ignited.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, an infrared output is generally provided that is at least about 90,000 w/ster in the short infrared band. In another embodiment, an infrared output of at least about 130,000 w/ster in the mid infrared band is generally provided. Still another embodiment may include a step of providing a first infrared output in the short infrared band and a second infrared output in the mid infrared band as a result of igniting the pellet assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of using a flare assembly, such as what may be characterized as a spectrally-balanced flare assembly. In this method, a pellet assembly is ejected from a flare assembly and ignited. As a result of igniting the pellet assembly, first infrared output associated with the pellet assembly is at least about 6,000 w/ster in the mid infrared band for a duration of at least about 2.0 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first infrared output may reach a peak infrared output of at least about 7,000 w/ster in one embodiment, at least about 7,500 w/ster in another embodiment, and at least about 8,000 w/ster in yet another embodiment. In one embodiment, a second infrared output of at least about 2,000 w/ster may be reached in the short infrared band during the above-mentioned duration of time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various refinements may exist of the features noted in relation to the above-disclosed aspects of the present invention. Further features may also be incorporated in these aspects of the present invention as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination. Moreover, each of the various features discussed herein in relation to one or more of the disclosed aspects of the present invention may generally be utilized by any other aspect(s) of the present invention as well, alone or in any combination.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention will now be described in relation to the accompanying drawings, which at least assist in illustrating the various pertinent features thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> for use in a pyrotechnic device such as a defensive countermeasure. This flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> is shown as including at a plurality of flare pellets <b>32</b> that are arranged in a stack at least generally along a longitudinal reference axis <b>34</b>. While the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> is illustrated as including twenty-three flare pellets <b>32</b>, it should be noted that other numbers of flare pellets <b>32</b> may be incorporated in other embodiments of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>. Moreover, the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> may exhibit any appropriate length <b>38</b> depending on such things as, for example, the desired overall length of the completed flare assembly the desired energy output of the assembly <b>30</b>, the dimensions of the individual flare pellets <b>32</b>, and the number of flare pellets <b>32</b> included in the assembly <b>30</b>. In any event, the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> is shown as having an aperture <b>36</b> that extends through each of the pellets <b>32</b> and that is defined along the reference axis <b>34</b>. This aperture <b>36</b> may extend up to a substantial entirety of the length <b>38</b> of the assembly <b>30</b> or may only extend along a portion of the length <b>38</b> of the assembly <b>30</b>. The aperture <b>36</b> may be utilized, as shown in subsequent embodiments, to accommodate an appropriate mechanical fastener that at least generally assists in holding the flare pellets <b>32</b> of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> in the illustrated stacked arrangement. It should be noted, however, that other embodiments may exist which do not have an aperture <b>36</b>, while other embodiments may include a plurality of apertures disposed in any of a number of appropriate locations and/or orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each of these flare pellets <b>32</b> of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> is made of an appropriate ignitable material. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the flare pellets <b>32</b> are made of an ignitable material including between about 40% and about 70% magnesium, between about 20% and about 50% sodium nitrate, and about 10% Laminac&#x2122; or the like. To enhance the structural integrity of each of the flare pellets <b>32</b>, it is preferred that the same are manufactured by pressing, casting, molding, and/or extruding the ignitable material into the desired shape/design of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary flare pellet <b>32</b> that is what may be characterized as substantially disk shaped, biconvex, or at least pseudo-biconvex, and that includes a top <b>40</b>, a bottom <b>42</b>, and a side <b>44</b>. While the flare pellet <b>32</b> is shown as having a width, or in this case, a diameter, <b>46</b> measured substantially perpendicular to the reference axis <b>34</b>, and a length <b>48</b> measured substantially parallel to the reference axis <b>34</b> that generally coincides with a distance between the top <b>40</b> and the bottom <b>42</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. This width <b>46</b> and length <b>48</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> may be any appropriate distances. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the width <b>46</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> may be about 1.277 inches, and the length <b>48</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> may be about 0.216 inch. Due to the design of the flare pellet <b>32</b>, a web of the same is generally equal to about half of the length <b>48</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in addition to the top <b>40</b>, bottom <b>42</b>, and side <b>44</b>, the flare pellet <b>32</b> also includes first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> (respectively). The first outer surface <b>50</b> at least generally spans between the top <b>40</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> and the side <b>44</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. Likewise, the second outer surface <b>52</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> at least generally spans between the bottom <b>42</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b> and the side <b>44</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. These first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are oriented such that it may be said that the flare pellet <b>32</b> at least generally tapers from its width <b>46</b> (measured at opposing portions of the side <b>44</b> and intersecting the reference axis <b>34</b>) toward a central width <b>54</b> associated with each of the top <b>40</b> and bottom <b>42</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. Moreover, these first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are oriented such that it may be said that the flare pellet <b>32</b> at least generally tapers from its length <b>48</b> (measured from the top <b>40</b> to the bottom <b>42</b> and parallel to the reference axis <b>34</b>) toward a peripheral length <b>56</b> associated with side <b>44</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>. Incidentally, a surface length <b>58</b> of each of the first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may be any appropriate length. For example, one preferred embodiment may have first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> both having a surface length <b>58</b> of about 0.411 inch. Incidentally, while the first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> have been described as having the same surface length <b>58</b>, other embodiments may exhibit first and second outer surfaces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> having differing outer surface lengths <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a flare pellet assembly of the invention, and as such, a &#x201c;single prime&#x201d; designation is used to distinguish the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;, as well as various features thereof, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> from the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Like the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is shown as including at a plurality of flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; that are arranged in a stack at least generally aligned with the longitudinal reference axis <b>34</b>. While the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; is illustrated as including at least twelve flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032;, it should be noted that other quantities of flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; may be incorporated in other embodiments of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates that the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; has an aperture <b>36</b> that extends through each of the pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; and that is defined along the reference axis <b>34</b>. Disposed at least generally within this aperture <b>36</b> is a rod <b>62</b> having a stop <b>64</b>, such as a head or other appropriate stop feature, at a first end <b>65</b> thereof and threading (not shown) disposed at a second opposing end <b>67</b> thereof. The threading associated with the second end <b>67</b> of the rod <b>62</b> is preferably threadingly engaged with a threaded nut <b>68</b>. In this arrangement, it may be said that the stack of flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; are positioned at least generally between the stop <b>64</b> of the rod <b>62</b> and the nut <b>68</b>. A length <b>38</b>&#x2032; of this flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; generally refers to a distance between the first end <b>65</b> of the rod <b>62</b> and most remote portion of one of the second end <b>67</b> of the rod <b>62</b> and the nut <b>68</b>. As with the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; may exhibit any appropriate length <b>38</b>&#x2032; depending on such things as, for example, the desired energy output of the assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;, the dimensions of the individual flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032;, and the number of flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; included in the assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;. One beneficial feature of this embodiment, is that the rod <b>62</b> is preferably designed so that the desired quantity of flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; associated with the assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; are substantially prevented from any significant movement in a direction parallel to the reference axis <b>34</b>. In other words, employment of this rod <b>62</b> and the nut <b>68</b> may be said to at least generally assist in longitudinally immobilizing the flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; relative to the rod <b>62</b>. Moreover, this rod <b>62</b> tends to provide structural support for the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;, and accordingly, at least generally reduces a tendency for structural damage during ejection of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; from a flare launcher.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;, an appropriate base <b>66</b> may be disposed at least generally between the stop <b>64</b> of the rod <b>62</b> and the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2032; nearest the stop <b>64</b>. This base may be made of any appropriate material such as aluminum or filled plastic, and may be utilized for any appropriate purpose. For example, the base <b>66</b> may be made of an appropriate shock absorbing material and may be employed to dampen at least some of the vibration associated with aircraft flight to at least generally hinder and/or prevent structural damage to the flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032;. Moreover, an appropriate washer <b>72</b> may also be disposed about the rod <b>62</b> toward the second end <b>67</b> of the rod <b>62</b>. Particularly, this washer <b>72</b> may be positioned at least generally between the nut <b>68</b> and the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2032; nearest the nut <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates that an appropriate adhesive or potting compound <b>70</b> such as, for example, epoxy or RTV (room-temperature-vulcanizing) adhesives/sealants may be employed in the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; to at least generally assist in immobilizing various parts of the assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;. More particularly, this adhesive <b>70</b> is shown as being disposed between each flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2032; and the rod <b>62</b>. This at least generally hinders movement of the flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; relative to the rod <b>62</b>. In addition, the adhesive <b>70</b> is disposed between the base <b>66</b> and the rod <b>64</b>. Further, the adhesive <b>70</b> may also be disposed between adjacent flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) to at least generally hinder movement of the flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032; relative to each other. It should be noted that any number of adhesives may be employed in this flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032;. For instance, a first adhesive may be disposed between the rod <b>62</b> and the flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032;, a second adhesive may be disposed between the rod <b>62</b> and the base <b>66</b>, and a third adhesive may be utilized between adjacent flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2032;.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a graph <b>82</b> demonstrating first and second outputs <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> (respectively) achieved using the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The first output <b>84</b> is indicative of energy output within the mid infrared band (e.g., a band between about 3.0&#x3bc; and about 5.5&#x3bc;), and the second output <b>86</b> is indicative of energy output within the short infrared band (e.g., a band between about 1.8&#x3bc; and about 3.0&#x3bc;). As shown, ignition of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; achieved a magnitude of at least about 6000 w/ster throughout a range of time spanning from about 0.7 second after ignition to about 3.6 seconds after ignition indicated by the first output <b>84</b>. Moreover, ignition of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; achieved a magnitude of about 2000 w/ster or more throughout that same time period indicated by the second output <b>86</b>. In addition, ignition of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; also provided a peak magnitude of about 8000 w/ster for the first output and a peak magnitude of about 2700 w/ster for the second output.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a spreadsheet comparing output of prior art infrared flares utilizing the pellet geometry illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref> (tests <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) with output achieved utilizing the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; (tests <b>5</b>-<b>9</b>). Incidentally, the form factors refer to the particular sizes of the flare assemblies and are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Referring to tests <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>, the design of the flare pellet assemblies of the invention has enabled these visual flares to achieve peak light outputs of more than 8.7 million candela and still be compatible with a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 inch form factor. Moreover, tests <b>5</b>-<b>7</b> indicate that those visual flash flares of the invention are also capable of providing peak infrared outputs of at least 14,615 w/ster in the short infrared band and at least 22,874 w/ster in the mid infrared band.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> show data indicative of the output that was produced from a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 inch form factor-compatible, infrared flash flare of the invention. This data of tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> may be compared to the data of test <b>3</b>, which is indicative of the output that was produced from a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 inch form factor-compatible, infrared flash flare having a prior art flare geometry like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref>. Tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> indicate that the infrared flash flares of the invention provided peak infrared outputs of at least about 106,004 w/ster in the short infrared band, as compared to only 27,192 w/ster provided by the prior art flare of test <b>3</b>. Moreover, tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> indicate that the infrared flash flares of the invention provided peak infrared outputs of at least about 145,281 w/ster in the mid infrared band, in comparison to only 40,896 w/ster provided by the prior art flare of test <b>3</b>. In addition to providing these peak infrared outputs, the infrared flash flares of tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b> also produced peak light outputs of at least about 1,668,127 candela, in comparison to only 641,587 candela from the prior art flare of test <b>3</b>. The differences in output and burn time are due, significantly in part, to the flare pellet assemblies of the invention having surface areas that are much greater than the surface areas of the prior art pellets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for corresponding form factors. For example, for a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 form factor, the surface area of a flare pellet assembly of the invention may be about 3.0 to about 4.5 times greater than the surface area of flare pellet <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it should be noted that the flare pellet geometry of test <b>4</b>, like that of test <b>3</b>, is like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref>. However, the flare pellet utilized generate the output shown in test <b>4</b> is compatible with a 2&#xd7;2.5&#xd7;8 inch form factor, and therefore includes a significant amount more ignitable flare material than the 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 form factor pellets utilized to produce the output indicated in tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b>. Even though the conventional infrared flare of test <b>4</b> is substantially larger in size than the infrared flash flares of tests <b>8</b>-<b>9</b>, which utilize the design of the present invention, the prior art infrared flare of test <b>4</b> failed to provide the peak outputs attained utilizing the flare pellet assembly design of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9B</figref>, toward the second end <b>104</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b> is a cap <b>110</b>.

The cap <b>110</b> may be at least temporarily held in place in any of a number of appropriate manners. For example, the cap <b>110</b> may be adhesively interconnected with the outer casing <b>108</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b> using an appropriate adhesive <b>112</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, disposed toward the first end <b>102</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b> is a number of components utilized to at least generally assist in launching/ejecting the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033; from a remainder of the flare assembly <b>100</b>. Defined in the case <b>108</b> is an impulse cartridge port <b>113</b> having a shipping plug <b>109</b> disposed therein. Further, a piston <b>107</b> is disposed adjacent the impulse cartridge port <b>113</b>. Also found between the first end <b>102</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b> and the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033; is a sequencing igniter <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In operation, the flare assembly <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be said to function in the following manner. Prior to use, the flare assembly <b>100</b> may be inserted into a magazine (not shown) of a flare dispenser (not shown). The shipping plug <b>109</b> may be removed from the impulse cartridge port <b>113</b> of the case <b>108</b>, and an appropriate impulse cartridge (not shown), such as an electro-explosive device, is inserted into the impulse cartridge port <b>113</b> of the case <b>108</b>. This procedure may be repeated until a desired number of flare assemblies <b>100</b> is installed in the magazine. The magazine, with any other appropriate ancillary components (not shown), may then be engaged or associated with a flare dispenser (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">To utilize the flare assembly <b>100</b>, an electrical firing current is applied to electrical contacts of the impulse cartridge (not shown) which generally causes a resistance element internal to the impulse cartridge to heat and ignite its pyrotechnic compositions. A propellant charge in the impulse cartridge burns, and the resulting hot gasses and hot particles rupture a closure of the impulse cartridge pressurizing the free volume between the first end <b>102</b> of the flare case <b>108</b> and the piston <b>107</b>. The hot gasses and hot particles from the impulse cartridge simultaneously flow through a spit hole <b>115</b> in the piston <b>107</b> and ignite a pyrotechnic pellet (not shown) that is internal to the pyrotechnic sequencing igniter <b>111</b>. The pressure of the hot gasses in the free volume between the first end <b>102</b> of the case <b>100</b> and the piston <b>107</b> biases the piston toward the pyrotechnic sequencing igniter <b>115</b>, which, in turn, is biased toward the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033;, which then pushes against the closure <b>110</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b>. The forces exerted against the closure <b>110</b> are preferably great enough to override or overcome the retention of the closure <b>110</b> within the case <b>108</b>. The pressure of the hot gasses behind the piston <b>107</b> continues to push against the above-mentioned components of the flare assembly <b>100</b>, thus causing the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033; to be ejected from the case <b>108</b> of the flare assembly <b>100</b>. Once clear of the case <b>108</b>, bore rider portions of the pyrotechnic sequencing igniter <b>111</b> move outward (e.g., away from the reference axis <b>34</b>) allowing a flame from the pyrotechnic pellet portion of the igniter <b>111</b> to impinge on an ignition material that the pellets <b>32</b>&#x2033; are coated with, thus igniting the stack of pellets <b>32</b>&#x2033; of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033;. In addition, pressure from the burning flare pellets <b>32</b>&#x2033; ruptures the protective wrap <b>72</b> of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033; completing ignition/activation of the assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033;. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates one appropriate design of a flare assembly <b>100</b> in which flare pellet assemblies of the invention (e.g., <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;, <b>30</b>&#x2033;) may be utilized, it should be noted that the flare pellet assemblies herein described may be employed in any appropriate flare launcher and/or flare assembly.</p>

These first and second widths <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>may be any appropriate widths. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the first width <b>46</b> is about 0.845 inch and the second width is about 1.880 inches. In addition to these widths <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b</i>, the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033; also has a length <b>48</b> measured substantially parallel to the reference axis <b>34</b> that generally coincides with a distance between the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and the bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;. This length <b>48</b> may be any appropriate length and, in one preferred embodiment, is about 0.225 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-C</figref>, in addition to the top <b>40</b>, bottom <b>42</b>, and sides <b>44</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033; also includes first, second, third, and fourth upper outer surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>c</i>, and <b>50</b><i>d </i>(respectively), and first, second, third, and fourth lower outer surfaces <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, <b>52</b><i>c</i>, and <b>52</b><i>d </i>(respectively). The first upper outer surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>at least generally extends between the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and the first side <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;. Likewise, the second upper outer surface <b>50</b><i>b </i>at least generally extends between the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and the second side <b>44</b><i>b </i>of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;, the third upper outer surface <b>50</b><i>c </i>at least generally extends between the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and the third side <b>44</b><i>c</i>, and the fourth upper outer surface <b>50</b><i>d </i>at least generally extends between the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and the fourth side <b>44</b><i>d</i>. Moreover, the first lower outer surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>at least generally extends between the bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; and the first side <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;, the second lower outer surface <b>52</b><i>b </i>at least generally extends between the bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; and the second side <b>44</b><i>b</i>, the third lower outer surface <b>52</b><i>c </i>at least generally extends between the bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; and the third side <b>44</b><i>c</i>, and the fourth lower outer surface <b>52</b><i>d </i>at least generally extends between the bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; and the fourth side <b>44</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The above-described upper and lower outer surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-C</figref> are configured such that it may be said that the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033; at least generally tapers from a first central portion <b>51</b> of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033; toward the sides <b>44</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;. Incidentally a width <b>46</b><i>c </i>of this central portion <b>51</b>, which also coincides with a width of the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033;, may be any of a number of appropriate distances, and, in one preferred embodiment, is about 0.400 inch. It may be said that flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033; at least generally narrows from it length <b>48</b>, found at the central portion <b>51</b>, to a side length <b>57</b> measured at any of the sides <b>44</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;. As another way of stating this, and as a more particular statement, the upper and lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are oriented at angles greater than 0&#xb0; and less than 90&#xb0; relative to a plane parallel with one or both the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033;. For instance, the first and third upper and lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>c</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>c </i>may be oriented at an angle &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d; of about 5&#xb0;. As another example, the second and fourth lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>d</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, <b>52</b><i>d </i>may be oriented at an angle &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x201d; of about 16.3&#xb0;. In some embodiments, one or more of the upper and lower outer surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be oriented at differing angles compared to the others. So, for instance, in one embodiment, all of the upper and lower outer surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may exhibit differing angles relative to a plane parallel with one or both the top <b>40</b>&#x2033; and bottom <b>42</b>&#x2033; of the flare pellet <b>32</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph showing first and second outputs <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> (respectively) of a spectrally balanced prior art flare having a geometry like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref> and having a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 form factor. By comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph showing third and fourth outputs <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> (respectively) of an embodiment of the flare pellet assembly <b>30</b>&#x2033; having a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;8 form factor and including the same ignitable composition as the flare pellet that was utilized to generate the output of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The output shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates that the corresponding flare's burn lasted for about 8 10 seconds, as opposed to the about 5 second burn time shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. This is due to the increased surface area of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> flare pellet (e.g., <b>32</b>&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) relative to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> flare pellet (e.g., <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Another way of stating this is that the shorter burn time illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is due to a smaller flare pellet web than the flare pellet web affecting the burn time shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Since the burn time of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is shorter than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the third output <b>124</b> is significantly greater than the first output <b>120</b> in the mid infrared band between about 0.8 seconds after ignition and about 2.8 seconds after ignition. Moreover, the fourth output <b>126</b> is, in most cases, generally equal to or greater than the second output <b>122</b> in the short infrared band and roughly in about the same time frame. Since infrared guided missiles may be appropriately decoyed away with a burn of only about 2-3 seconds, this greater output of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may more closely resemble an exhaust plume of an aircraft and may be more effective than the flare of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This shorter burn time and greater output has previously been unattainable as prior attempts at providing a flare pellet with such output have resulted in flare pellets with degraded spectral ratios (e.g., attempting to formulate faster burning compositions) and/or structural instability (e.g., could not withstand flight vibration without chipping, cracking, and/or breaking).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates one example of a device <b>150</b> that may be utilized in making the individual flare pellets (e.g., <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>&#x2032;, <b>32</b>&#x2033;). This device <b>150</b> may be characterized as having a punch <b>152</b> and anvil <b>164</b>. The punch <b>152</b> of the device <b>150</b> is generally a solid structure, except for a core rod receptacle <b>156</b> defined therein. The anvil <b>164</b> of the device <b>150</b> includes a sleeve <b>158</b> to at least generally assist in keeping a pellet precursor material <b>160</b> from leaking out from sides of the device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To make a flare pellet assembly, such as any of the flare pellet assemblies described herein, the removable sleeve <b>158</b> is associated with the device <b>150</b>. Then, a pre-measured charge of one or more ignitable materials, or flare pellet precursor material <b>160</b>, is loaded at least generally into the sleeve <b>158</b>. At or before this point, it is desirable to have the anvil <b>164</b> and core rod <b>166</b> preassembled together with the sleeve <b>158</b>. The punch <b>152</b> is assembled to the tooling with the core rod <b>166</b> nesting up into the receptacle <b>156</b> defined in the punch <b>152</b>. The charged tooling is then placed on a press <b>162</b> (usually a hydraulic press). The press <b>162</b> is energized, and the press biases at least one of the punch <b>152</b> and the anvil <b>164</b> toward the other at least generally in one of the directions indicated by arrow <b>168</b>, thus forming the flare pellet precursor material <b>160</b> into a pellet. The press <b>162</b> is then retracted, and the tooling removed. The punch <b>152</b> and the anvil/core rod <b>166</b> are then removed from the tooling leaving the flare composition pellet in the sleeve <b>158</b>. The sleeve <b>158</b> is then again placed on a push out sleeve <b>154</b> of the device <b>150</b>, and the punch <b>152</b> is again directed into the sleeve <b>158</b>. The tooling is then placed back into the press <b>162</b>, and the action of the press <b>162</b> is used to push the flare pellet out of the sleeve <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates one device for making flare pellets, other appropriate manners including, but not limited to, extrusion, molding, and/or casting of flare pellets may also be utilized to form a plurality of flare pellets. In any event, once these individual flare pellets are fabricated, the same are stacked to form a pellet assembly (e.g., <b>30</b>), and an appropriate casing (e.g., <b>72</b>) is disposed about at least a portion of the pellet assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Various manners of forming usable pellets may depend on the pyrotechnic or even potentially pyrophoric compositions being utilized. For instance, some compositions can be formed into pellets by pressing and typically not by extruding or casting. Other compositions may be formed into pellets by casting only, while others may be suitable for extruding, and still others by pressing and extruding. As a more particular example, the spectrally balanced flare compositions and the visible light flare compositions described herein may be pressed to form a pellet, while the MTV composition used for infrared flash flares may be pressed or extruded. It should be noted, however, that any appropriate manner of forming any appropriate composition(s) into flare pellets is included within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Again, one of the objects of the invention is to provide a flare pellet geometry that provides a thinner web (e.g., distance between peripheral surfaces of the flare pellet and a geometric center of the same) than can be obtained using conventional fabrication methods. The thin web design of the flare pellets, with their attendant high initial surface areas, at least generally promote a rapid, high-intensity burn that may be tailored or controlled to mimic a spectral signature of an aircraft exhaust plume. Accordingly, the web thickness may be no more than about 0.20 inch in one embodiment, no more than about 0.17 inch in another embodiment, no more than about 0.15 inch in still another embodiment, and no more than about 0.12 inch in yet another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The flare pellets (e.g., <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>&#x2032;, <b>32</b>&#x2033;) of the invention are typically thinner at the outer edges than in the center. When assembled in a stack as a flare pellet assembly (e.g., <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;, <b>30</b>&#x2033;), this difference in thickness from the central portion to the outer edges defines grooves between adjacent flare pellets to which ignition materials may be applied and, upon ignition of the flare pellet assembly, allows relief for rapid escape of hot gasses. In other words, the stacked pellet configuration provides a significantly larger surface area available for combustion than conventional designs. For example, the prior art flare pellet <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a surface area per gram of flare composition of only about 0.283 sq in./g. By contrast, the flare pellet assemblies of the invention exhibit surface areas per gram of flare composition of about 0.76 sq in./g in one embodiment and about 0.85 sq in./g in another embodiment. This larger than normal surface area promotes the rapid burning of the flare pellet assembly yielding increased mass flow and resultant higher than normal energy output for a shorter overall period of time. A shape of the time versus intensity energy output curve can be modified to suit the intended application by varying, among other things, any of the geometric features, some of which are:</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">1) the thickness of one or more of the pellets in the stack;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">2) the number of pellets in a given form factor;</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">3) the radii of the bi-convex pellet surfaces;</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">4) the angle(s) of the various surfaces (e.g., <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032;, <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>52</b>, <b>52</b>&#x2032;, <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>); and</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">5) the dimensions of the central portions of one or more pellets.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When assembled, the stack of pellets provide a rapid burning substitute for a conventional flare pellet. The assembly can then be prepared and assembled into any standard form factor flare case, along with any appropriate ancillary flare hardware, to yield a completed flare that can be fired using any appropriate flare launcher system.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Those skilled in the art will now see that certain modifications can be made to the assembly and related methods herein disclosed with respect to the illustrated embodiments, without departing from the spirit of the instant invention. And while the invention has been described above with respect to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is adapted to numerous rearrangements, modifications, and alterations, and all such arrangements, modifications, and alterations are intended to be within the scope of the appended claims. For instance, while the invention has been disclosed in regard to aircraft defensive countermeasures, the invention may have application in pyrotechnic devices at least generally associated with naval and/or land vehicles.</p>
