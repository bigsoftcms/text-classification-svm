<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A flow responsive valve for a flow metering system comprising a fluid meter having a minimum measuring flow threshold. The valve is shiftable between an open position at flow rates above the minimum measuring flow threshold, and a pressure pulsating position depending on pressure differential over an inlet port and an outlet port of the valve. The pressure pulsating position alters between a closed position essentially prohibiting fluid flow therethrough at flow rates below the minimum measuring flow threshold, and an open position admitting fluid flow into the supply line at a measurable flow rate above the minimum measuring flow threshold.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a method, a system and a device for metering fluid flow. More particularly the invention is concerned with a method rendering a conventional fluid meter suitable for metering also significantly low flow rates, even below the measurable flow rate of the metering device. The invention is further concerned with a fluid flow measuring system and a device useful for carrying out the method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The measurement and monitoring of low volume fluid flows has various applications including applications in industrial and residential settings. For example, in the chemical industry the accurate and precise knowledge of inlet and outlet flows for a myriad of processes (e.g. chemical reactions) can be critical to the optimal production and processing of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the like. Precise monitoring of flows can also be used to discover and prevent leaks which can be costly and be a safety issue.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Additionally, the lack of low-flow monitoring can result in losses to the suppliers of such flow. For example, water companies are compensated for water usage as measured by their flow monitors (water meters). If their flow monitors do not measure trickle or drip flow, they are not reimbursed for such usage. The loss of revenue can be considerable. Additionally, the location of the loss is not detected thereby allowing a large amount of water to be wasted. This is particularly an issue in the many countries with limited water supplies. Furthermore the knowledge of this monitoring limitation can be used to steal water, for example by slowly dripping water into a holding tank, at a rate not measurable by the associated flow meter, and consuming the water directly from the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Turbine flow meters, which are the conventional magnetic flow meters in general use today have long been used to measure fluid flow by means of a turbine immersed in the fluid. A magnet connected to the turbine turns a second magnet, which is placed in a dry area. The second magnet drives a cog system that turns a mechanical counter. These flow meters are unable to detect low flows e.g. below about 10 l/h when considering a typical water meter of the type installed by water supply companies and municipalities world wide. Positive displacement metering devices are also commonly used to measure flow rate and they have deficiencies in particular where water is of poor quality i.e. has a high calcium content or contains dirt such as sand.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other types of flow meters are also known, some of which are devices for measuring low volumetric fluid flow. However such meters are typically costly, require servicing and are difficult to retrofit, thus are usually not used for domestic water metering.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Droplet counter devices are also known, wherein a sensor is provided for droplet count. However, such devices usually service for laboratories and are not cost-effective in massive installation, e.g. for use by a water supply company, certainly not for urban use. Even more so, such systems are not easily retrofitted and they require some considerable space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,346 to Meixler is a low volume flow meter for determining if a fluid flow meets a minimum threshold level of flow. The monitor includes an externally located electrical portion, which operates with a minimum of intrusion to the flow and allows for repairs. The electronics provide for the adjustment of the threshold level and can be modified to provide for a parallel electronic circuit for a bracketing of the desired flow rate. However, the system is not simple or inexpensive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another type of flow rate device that has the capacity to measure or monitor a low flow rate is a compound meter. In this case, the device comprises a high flow metering device together with a secondary flow meter that is typically located in a by-pass conduit. There is typically some means for diverting flow (e.g. by using a &#x201c;change-over&#x201d; valve set to activate at a pre-determined pressure) based on a pre-determined flow rate or pressure in order to direct the flow to the appropriate meter. These meters typically suffer from at least some of the above-mentioned drawbacks and in particular are expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A problem which may occur with flow metering devices is so-called &#x2018;over-efficient&#x2019;, where the flow meter may read excessive amounts of fluid, which in fact have not flown through the system. This may result for example, owing to inertial revolutions of the measuring impeller of the metering device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention there is provided a fluid supply system comprising a supply line and flow metering device and a flow responsive valve; said flow metering device admitting flow through the system for only measurable fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The arrangement is such that when flow rate exceeds a minimal measurable flow rate threshold the valve is open owing to a pressure differential over its inlet port and outlet port; and when the flow rate drops below said minimal measurable flow rate threshold, the valve enters a pulsating position having a closed state thereby substantially restricting flow through the system, and an open state allowing fluid flow into the system; said open state having a flow rate exceeding the minimal measurable flow rate threshold; where portions of the supply line downstream of the flow meter and devices fitted thereon function as a fluid accumulator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, an average fluid flow through the system remains constant over time, whereby a consumer downstream of said metering device does not acknowledge flow rate fluctuations imparted by the system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, there is a fluid metering system comprising a fluid supply line and a meter for measuring fluid flow therethrough, said meter having a minimum measuring flow threshold; the system further comprising a flow responsive valve imparting the system with a flow pattern having a pulsating character so as to substantially prohibit flow at a flow rate below the minimum measuring threshold, and resume flow of only measurable quantities of fluid. The flow responsive valve is in fact responsive to flow rate and to pressure differential extending between an inlet and an outlet of the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect the present invention is concerned with a method for metering fluid flow through a fluid supply line comprising a flow meter having a minimum measurable threshold and a flow responsive valve imparting a flow pattern therethrough with a pulsating character so as to substantially restrict flow at a flow rate below the minimum measuring threshold, and resume flow of only measurable quantities of fluid. The arrangement is such that the fluid supply line and any devices fitted thereon function as an accumulator, whereby at an open state of the flow responsive valve, during its open phase, fluid accumulates in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is also directed to a valve comprising an inlet port connectable to an upstream side of a fluid supply line, and an outlet port connectable to an downstream side of the fluid supply line; a control chamber extending between the inlet port and the outlet port and a sealing member disposed within said control chamber, said sealing member having an inlet sealing surface having a sealing surface area and a control portion having a control surface area; and a bleed aperture determining a minimal flow threshold through the control chamber; wherein the sealing member displaces between an open position and a closed position depending on a pressure differential over the sealing member.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A fluid supply system according to the concerned invention is suitable for use with gases or liquids and has a significant advantage of being inexpensive, reliable and suitable for easy retrofit installation on existing flow metering systems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further advantage of the device in accordance with the present invention is that it serves also as a one way valve preventing flow from a downstream direction to an upstream direction, i.e. from the consumer towards the supplier, in the case of a liquid supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a flow responsive valve according to the invention, further fitted for controlled restriction of fluid flow at the open state of the pulsating position of the device. Accordingly, an impeller of a flow meter fitted in conjunction with a valve according to this embodiment will not reach significant revolutionary speed and inertial force is reduced, thereby governing the overriding excessive metering. However, the valve according to this embodiment substantially does not effect fluid flow and metering at a consuming state thereof, i.e. when flow rate exceeds a minimal measurable flow rate threshold.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is suitable for implementation in a variety of fluid supply systems, however, for the sake of convenience and for exemplifying only, references hereinafter is made to a water supply system, e.g. an urban/municipal water supply network.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Attention is first directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings schematically illustrating an end portion of an urban/municipal water supply system wherein an end use is for example a house, an office, a plant etc. The house, in the present example, is connected to a main water supply line designated <b>10</b> via a flow meter <b>12</b> with a suitable network of pipes <b>18</b> branching for example to end devices such as a solar water heating system <b>20</b>, wash basins <b>22</b>, toilets <b>26</b> and garden faucets <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of the above end items, including the piping <b>18</b> is vulnerable to leaks owing to faulty sealing means (washers, gaskets, etc.), leaks in the piping, poor connections, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a water supply system not fitted with a device in accordance with the present invention, any such leaks which are below the minimal measurable flow threshold (a common such minimal threshold is about 10 liter/hour) would not be detected and would not be measurable, i.e. causing the water supplier considerable loss, not to mention the waste of fresh water which in some regions in the world is an acute problem.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to render a standard flow meter <b>12</b> capable of measuring also small amounts of water, there is installed a flow responsive valve generally designated <b>36</b>. The valve <b>36</b> is sensitive to flow rate and pressure differential over its inlet and outlet ports, as will be explained hereinafter in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The valve <b>36</b> is a normally closed valve which opens whenever an end device is opened for consumption of water, e.g. upon flushing the toilet <b>26</b> or the like, when the consumed rate exceeds the minimal measurable flow threshold. However, when there is no consumption of water by either of the end devices, the valve <b>36</b> spontaneously returns to its closed position. If a leak occurs at one or more locations along the piping <b>18</b> or at one or more of the end devices <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, the flow responsive valve <b>36</b> remains closed whereby a pressure differential &#x394;P is being built between an inlet <b>40</b> connected upstream and an outlet <b>42</b> connected downstream. Such a pressure differential is built owing to the essentially constant pressure at the inlet <b>40</b> and the dropping pressure at outlet <b>42</b>. When the pressure differential &#x394;P reaches a predetermined threshold, the flow responsive valve <b>36</b> opens for a while, to allow water flow to the piping <b>18</b> until the valve reaches a pressure differential lower then a predetermined pressure threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a superimposed graph schematically illustrating the pressure and flow rate over time, measured downstream of the flow responsive valve <b>36</b>. The upper horizontal line represents the minimal measurable flow threshold of the metering device <b>12</b> whilst the lower horizontal line represents the flow consumption during a low flow consumption, e.g. owing to several leaks at the piping <b>18</b> and/or end devices <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> which are below the minimum measurable flow threshold of the metering device <b>12</b>. The graph represented by the letter Q represents the pulsating flow character through the flow meter where it is noticeable that flow is always above the minimum measurable flow threshold of the metering device <b>12</b> and operates in an on/off mode, i.e. all flow through the meter <b>12</b> is measurable. The line represented by the letter P illustrates the corresponding pressure in the system which also has a pulsating character.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further attention will now be directed to several embodiments of a pressure sensitive valve in accordance with embodiments of the present invention by way of examples only. It is appreciated that many other embodiments are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, reference is made to a valve generally designated <b>50</b> which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is illustrated in its open position and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is illustrated in its normally closed position. The valve <b>50</b> comprises a housing <b>52</b>, an inlet port <b>54</b> and an outlet port <b>56</b> both fitted for screw coupling to a pipe section (not shown) by suitable threadings <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The valve <b>50</b> is fitted with an inlet nozzle <b>62</b> having a diameter D<sub>i</sub>. A sealing member <b>64</b> is axially displaceable within the housing <b>52</b> and is normally biased by means of coiled spring <b>66</b> into a normally sealed position, so as to seal the inlet nozzle <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Sealing member <b>64</b> is fitted at an inlet end thereof with a resilient sealing portion <b>68</b> for improved sealing of the inlet nozzle <b>62</b>. Furthermore, and as noted in the figures, the housing <b>52</b> has a central bore <b>70</b> slidingly supporting the sealing member <b>64</b>, said bore <b>70</b> having a diameter D<sub>b</sub>. Sealing member <b>64</b> has at an outlet end thereof adjacent a shoulder portion <b>74</b> having a predetermined tolerance with the bore <b>70</b>, said tolerance determining a leak rate corresponding with the pulsating sequence imparted to the sequence, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further noticeable, bore <b>70</b> is formed at an outlet side thereof with an expanded portion <b>80</b> of diameter D<sub>o</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The arrangement is such that when the valve <b>50</b> is in its open position, the should portion <b>74</b> of the sealing member <b>64</b> reaches the expanded portion <b>80</b> to allow essentially free flow through the valve <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The arrangement is such that the biasing force Fs of the spring <b>66</b> is predetermined whereby the valve <b>50</b> remains in its closed position as long as the pressure differential &#x394;P does not exceed a predetermined pressure determined by the relationship between D<sub>I</sub>, Fs and the pressure at the inlet port <b>54</b> and outlet port <b>56</b>. Thus, the force required to open the valve <b>50</b> is determined by Fs&#x3c;&#x394;P*A(D<sub>i</sub>), where A(D<sub>i</sub>) is the surface area at the inlet nozzle <b>62</b>. Similarly, the valve <b>50</b> will close when &#x394;P&#x3c;Fs/A(D<sub>o</sub>), where A(D<sub>o</sub>) is the surface area at the expanded portion <b>80</b>. It is also apparent that the pressure differential required for closing the valve <b>50</b> is lower than that required for generating a pulse in the system, this being since D<sub>i</sub>&#x3c;D<sub>o</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The arrangement is such that when the pressure differential over the inlet port <b>54</b> and outlet port <b>56</b> is smaller than a predetermined threshold, the valve <b>50</b> remains sealed since the only force acting is the biasing force Fs of spring <b>66</b>. However, when pressure at the outlet port <b>56</b> drops (e.g. upon a leak at the piping of the system or at one of the end devices, as discussed hereinabove) and there the inlet pressure at inlet port <b>54</b> remains essentially constant, the pressure differential over the valve <b>50</b> increases and the sealing member <b>64</b> will displace into its open position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, it is appreciated that the shoulders <b>74</b> of the sealing member <b>64</b> take the role in retaining the sealing member in the open position under a pressure differential. It is further appreciated that the tolerance between the diameter of the shoulder <b>74</b> and the bore <b>70</b> in fact determines the pulsating timing, as it determines a so-called leak rate of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> in which a valve <b>80</b> is principally similar to the valve discussed hereinabove in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> and accordingly, reference is made only to the differing element which is the shape of the shoulder <b>84</b> of the sealing member <b>86</b> and the corresponding change in shape of the expanded portion <b>88</b> of the cylindric bore <b>90</b> of the housing. The purpose of this particular design is to give rise to a narrow flow path <b>91</b> when the valve is in its open positions as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to thereby give rise to an increased flow velocity and at the bore <b>90</b>, generating a force acting to the direction of arrow <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) namely in the direction to assist in displacing the sealing member <b>86</b> into an open position, contrary to the force imparted by coiled spring <b>94</b>. This is obtained by local increase of flow velocity causing low static pressure down stream, thus decreasing the head loss.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> renders the valve <b>30</b> oven/closed position more significant and avoids undefined positions and scattering of the valve at near to equilibrium position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate still another embodiment of a pressure sensitive valve in accordance with the present invention generally designated <b>100</b> wherein the sealing force is imparted by magnetic means, rather than by a coiled spring as in the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the housing comprises an inlet segment <b>104</b> formed with an inlet port <b>106</b>, and an outlet segment <b>108</b> fitted with an outlet port <b>110</b>, both said inlet and said outlet being fitted with a suitable threading for coupling to a pipe segment (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Outlet segment <b>108</b> is formed adjacent the inlet segment <b>104</b> with a tapering portion <b>114</b> and with a stopper member <b>116</b>. A sealing member <b>120</b> being a magnetic sphere <b>122</b> coated with a resilient layer <b>124</b>, has a diameter larger than the narrow most portion of the tapering wall <b>114</b> and similarly, the diameter of the sealing member <b>120</b> is larger than the gaps <b>130</b> of stopper member <b>116</b>. The arrangements is such that the sealing member <b>120</b> is displaceable within the housing between a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) wherein it sealingly engages the tapering wall portion <b>114</b>, and an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) wherein it disengages from the tapering portion <b>114</b> to allow free flow through the valve <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The biasing force is imparted on the sealing member <b>120</b> by means of the magnetic inlet member <b>104</b> acting on the magnetic sphere <b>122</b> of sealing member <b>120</b> into sealing engagement with the narrow most portion of the tapering wall portion <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The valve in accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> operates in a similar manner as discussed in connection with the valves of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> and the reader's attention is directed thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A further advantage of the valve in accordance with the present invention, is that it serves also as a one way valve preventing flow from a downstream direction (i.e. from the consumer) to an upstream direction (i.e. towards the supplier). This feature is of particular importance e.g. in connection with a water supply system and serves to prevent flow of contaminated water towards the supplier in case of a flood or burst in supply pipes, where there is risk of mud and dirt entering the system and flowing upstream and possibly contaminating water reservoirs and harming equipment of the water supplier.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated a schematic graph representing various situations of measured flow consumption MC versus actual flow consumption AC, in volumetric units, e.g. m3. The line marked I represents the ideal situation where actual water consumption is essentially identical to measured water consumption in a linear fashion. However, this situation will usually not occur owing to the design of common flow meters, e.g. domestic water meters etc., whereby an impeller is provided, the latter gaining inertial forces subject to velocity of water flowing therethrough. Accordingly, even after termination of liquid flow through the flow meter, the impeller will tend to continue revolving for a while, owing to said inertial forces. It is appreciated that this situation is not desired in particular where monitoring of liquid flow is of importance or where it is desired to correctly charge for actual water consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The measured consumption MC for a typical flow meter not fitted with a device in accordance with the present invention is represented by line II and it is thus appreciated that there is a significant portion of unmeasured liquid which cannot be measured and respectively charged.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Upon installation of a valve in accordance with some embodiments, the flow meter will yield an &#x2018;over efficient&#x2019; performance illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the line marked III, i.e. measuring quantities of water which in fact were not consumed. This phenomena takes place owing to many occurrences of closing and opening the valve, involving inertia forces.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Accordingly, it is desirable to introduce a device which will compensate for the &#x2018;over efficiency&#x2019; and will reach a measured consumption near to actual consumption as illustrated for example by line marked IV.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is appreciated that for good orders sake the performance of the valve in accordance with the line marked IV extends below the optimal line marked I, so as to ensure that the consumer remains under charged rather than over charged.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With further attention now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is illustrated a modification of the valve in accordance with the present invention, generally designated <b>150</b> comprising a housing <b>152</b>, an inlet port <b>154</b> screw coupled to an upstream pipe section <b>155</b>, and an outlet port <b>156</b> screw coupled to a downstream pipe section <b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Fitted at the inlet and of the housing there is provided a diaphragm seal <b>160</b> retained between an annular shoulder portion <b>162</b> of the housing and a diaphragm support disk <b>164</b> retained by a retention nut <b>166</b>, whereby the diaphragm seal <b>160</b> is deformable only in a downstream direction, as will be apparent hereinafter, in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Diaphragm seal <b>160</b> tends to follow displacement of a plunger <b>170</b> owing to pressure differential about its faces. However, at a certain stage the diaphragm seal disengages from the plunger and will return to its normal position at rest.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A pressure responsive sealing assembly is received within the housing <b>152</b>, comprising an axially displaceable plunger <b>170</b> and a stationary cup member <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Formed between the plunger <b>170</b> and the cup member <b>172</b> there is a dampening assembly received within a confined space <b>174</b>, which in the present examples holds a coiled spring <b>176</b> received within the cylindrical sleeve <b>178</b> of the cup member <b>172</b>, said spring biasing at one end against the cup member <b>172</b> and at an opposed end thereof against the plunger <b>170</b>. A sealing sleeve <b>180</b>, made of a resilient material, is applied over the cylindrical extension <b>184</b> of the plunger <b>170</b> and <b>178</b> of the cup member <b>172</b>, to thereby restrict liquid flow into the confined space <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The circumferential peripheral edge <b>190</b> of the plunger <b>170</b> is sharp-edged serving as a scraper bearing against the cylindrical surface <b>194</b> of the housing, continuously cleaning it from scale, algae and other dirt particles, as the plunger <b>170</b> axially displaces within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to a particular embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the plunger <b>170</b> and the cup member <b>172</b> have complementary shapes offering an advantage in particular in the completely open position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, upon water consumption downstream. Furthermore, it is noted that the circumferential peripheral edge <b>198</b> of the cup member <b>172</b> is chamfered so as to easily engage with the corresponding scraper edge <b>190</b> of the plunger <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8F</figref>, illustrating how the valve in accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> actually operates. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, plunger <b>170</b> is in its retracted position, remote from the cup member <b>172</b> and sealingly bearing against the diaphragm seal <b>160</b>. This position is the so-called closed position wherein there is no water consumption and no water leak. In this situation, water pressure at the inlet port <b>154</b> is substantially equal to the pressure at the outlet port <b>156</b>, i.e., the pressure differential &#x394;P equals 0 namely, the inlet pressure equals the outlet pressure (Pi=Po).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, at the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the valve <b>150</b> is still at the so-called closed position with no significant water consumption downstream of the valve, however, with some water leak occurring, at a flow rate which is below the measurable threshold of the water metering device (not shown). This results in pressure decrease at the outlet side of the valve <b>150</b>, building up a pressure differential &#x394;P&#x2267;0 over the valve, where Pi is greater than Po. However, the pressure differential is still not significant and will not displace the valve into the open position. For the sake of clarity, high pressure zone is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8F</figref> by dense dotting whereas low pressure zone at the valve is indicated by non-densed dotting. It is apparent that in the situation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> the valve remains in the closed and sealed position wherein the diaphragm seal <b>170</b> sealingly bears against the diaphragm seal <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Resulting in further leakage, downstream of the valve <b>150</b> (however with no significant consumption) the pressure differential over the device <b>150</b> increases, causing the plunger <b>170</b> to slightly extract in a downstream direction, however followed by deformation of the diaphragm seal <b>160</b> which follows the plunger <b>170</b> and ensures that the valve is closed. It is apparent that as long as no water flow occurs between the inlet port towards the outlet port, the water metering device (not shown) does not sense any flow and will not indicate flow as the measuring element (e.g. an impeller) remains still.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As the pressure continues to drop at the outlet port <b>156</b>, water leaks through an interstice between the plunger <b>170</b> and the surface <b>194</b> of the housing <b>152</b>, resulting in slight pressure increase at the outlet port <b>156</b>, and further resulting in displacement of the diaphragm seal <b>160</b> to its normal position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to facilitate leakage between the scraper edge <b>190</b> of the plunger <b>170</b> and the surface <b>194</b>, one or more narrow grooves <b>198</b> are formed at contact zone of the scraper edge <b>190</b> with the surface <b>194</b>, as illustrated in the enlarged portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Disengagement of the diaphragm seal <b>160</b> from the plunger <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>) results in further displacement of the plunger <b>170</b> towards the cup member <b>172</b>, whereby water flow is increased, further resulting in pressure equilibrium about the sealing assembly <b>168</b>. Such an increase in water flow is above the minimal readable threshold of the metering device (not shown) and thus the water now flowing through the device at such a pulsating opening of the valve, is measurable by the flow meter.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The restricted flow at the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> ensures that the impeller of the flow metering device does not spin at high speed and thus does not gain high inertial forces and accordingly, when a flow pulse through the valve device <b>150</b> ceases, the impeller of the flow meter will immediately halt thus not incurring excessive metering.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this position, the sealing sleeve <b>180</b> facilitates slow filling of water into the confined space <b>174</b>, thus dampening/slowing the closing stage of the valve, thereby improving the ratio between the measured consumption MC and the actual consumption AC.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is however appreciated that the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref> is not a water consuming position but rather a position in which the piping downstream is refilled at a measurable pulse of water flow, to compensate for the water which has dripped from the piping and from the different supply devices.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, the valve <b>150</b> is illustrated in a completely opened position wherein water is consumed by a consumer downstream (not shown) resulting in complete displacement of the plunger <b>170</b> into engagement of the edges <b>170</b> with the corresponding edge <b>198</b> of the cup member <b>172</b>, to give rise to an egg-like aerodynamic shape, facilitating water flow in a downstream direction at high flow rate, as per demand.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The addition of a dampening assembly, i.e. the sealing sleeve <b>180</b> or any other damping means, e.g. a viscous fluid, friction arrangements, water orifice, etc. will result in measured consumption MC near to line IV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> whilst in the absence of such a damping assembly, the measured consumption is near to line III in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At the absence of sealing sleeve <b>180</b>, one would possibly sense a short delay in water supply upon consumption downstream, e.g. upon opening a tap, etc., owing to water first entering the confined space <b>174</b> and only then flowing through the outlet <b>156</b> downstream. However, applying the elastic sealing sleeve <b>180</b> ensures that upon rapid build up of differential pressure over the device (as a result of water consumption downstream), above a predetermined threshold, the sealing sleeve <b>180</b> will deform to disengage from the cylindrical portion <b>178</b> of the cup member <b>172</b>, thus facilitating rapid draining of the confined space <b>174</b>, whereby a consumer downstream does not feel a pressure drop.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is appreciated that the above embodiments are merely example of valves suitable for use with a metering system and method as disclosed above and many other such valves may be designed, all of which fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
