<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In an auto image stabilization system, a driving member formed as a wire of shape memory alloy (SMA) is retained by a projection of an image capturing unit. A distance Lb from the rotation center of an elastic deforming part to center of gravity (point of application) of the image capturing unit is longer than a distance La from the rotation center of the elastic deforming part to the projection (power point). In the configuration, equivalent mass (apparent mass) of the image capturing unit becomes (Lb/La) times, and it causes deterioration in response. Consequently, the driving member having an ellipse-shaped section in which a value obtained by dividing the width in the longer direction of the section by the width in the shorter direction is 1.3 or larger is employed. As a result, heat dissipation of the driving member increases, so that response in the SMA actuator can be properly improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a driving apparatus for driving a movable part by using an actuator connected to the movable part.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A shape memory alloy (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;SMA&#x201d;) has a property such that even if it is plastic-deformed by an external force at a temperature equal to or less than martensite transformation start temperature, when heated to a temperature equal to or higher than reverse transformation end temperature, the SMA regains its memorized original shape. A driving apparatus using, as an actuator, an SMA having such a property is known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of making auto image stabilization by an actuator using the SMA (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;SMA actuator&#x201d;), the driving performance of cancelling out a hand shake of about at least 10 Hz is demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A technique for improving the driving performance of an SMA actuator having low response is proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-125590. According to the technique, by improving a phase lag by performing two or more derivative control actions in a servo control system, the response of the SMA actuator is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the technique of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-125590, two or more derivative control actions are performed. Consequently, noise included in a measurement signal of position or the like is also amplified, and a special filter or the like is necessary as a countermeasure. Since tuning of the derivative control is difficult, there is also a problem such that a correction according to a change in environment temperature and the like is necessary. In the case of improving the response of the SMA actuator only by improving the control system (software), various problems occur as side effects. As a result, the response cannot be properly improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a driving apparatus. According to the present invention, the driving apparatus includes: (a) a movable part; and (b) an actuator connected to the movable part and driving the movable part, the actuator having a first elastic part and a second elastic part which are connected to the movable part in a push-pull relation. At least one of the first elastic part and the second elastic part is formed as a wire made of a shape memory alloy, and a sectional shape of the wire is flattened in shape. With the configuration, heat dissipation of shape memory alloy (SMA) increases, so that the response of the SMA actuator can be properly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the driving apparatus further includes: (c) a sensor for obtaining a measurement value with regard to a driving of the movable part; and (d) a controller for passing current to the wire on basis of a deviation between a drive target value of the movable part and the measurement value in order to control a driving of the movable part. With the configuration, servo driving on the movable part can be performed properly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a driving apparatus realizing proper improvement in response of the SMA actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

The cover glass <b>12</b><i>b </i>having translucency has the role of preventing entry of a foreign object from the outside to the image capturing unit <b>9</b> and the role of transmitting an optical image of the subject and guiding the optical image to the image pickup device <b>5</b> via the taking lens <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> has a shake detector <b>8</b> fixed to the outer wall of the member <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The shake detector <b>8</b> detects a shake of the cellular phone <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> further includes an elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>having an almost columnar shape. The elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>is provided between the image capturing unit <b>9</b> and the body-side member <b>12</b>. One of end faces of the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, and the other end face is fixed to the body-side member <b>12</b>. In such a manner, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is basically fixed to the body-side member <b>12</b> by the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is supported by the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>having elasticity, in the case where a driving force of a driving unit <b>16</b> to be described later is applied, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> can rotate two-dimensionally using the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>as a fulcrum, concretely, can move around the X axis (in the pitch direction) and around the Y axis (in the yaw direction). That is, when a force larger than the holding force of the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>is applied, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> can swing around predetermined rotation axes (the axis parallel with the X axis, and the axis parallel with the Y axis) with respect to the body-side member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, also in the case where the body of the cellular phone <b>1</b> swings due to a camerashake or the like, by moving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the direction of cancelling off the swing detected by the shake sensor <b>8</b> (in other words, in the direction opposite to the detected swing), the shake can be corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is fixed to the body-side member <b>12</b> when it is not driven by the driving unit <b>16</b> (which will be described later), and moves relative to the body-side member <b>12</b> when the driving force of the driving unit <b>16</b> is given. In short, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is supported (held) with appropriate strength.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the XYZ orthogonal coordinate system is set.

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">The Details of Driving System of Auto Image Stabilization System <b>10</b></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> has the driving unit <b>16</b> for driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b>. Specifically, the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> has a P drive actuator <b>16</b>P for driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the direction of rotation around the X axis (pitch direction) and a Y drive actuator <b>16</b>Y (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) for driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the direction of rotation around the Y axis (yaw direction). In other words, the P drive actuator <b>16</b>P can rotate the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the pitch direction, and the Y drive actuator <b>16</b>Y can rotate the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the yaw direction. By turning the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the pitch and yaw directions using the P and Y drive actuators <b>16</b>P and <b>16</b>Y, a shake of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, that is, a camerashake can be corrected. As a camerashake, for example, a shake of sine wave of about 1 to 10 Hz can be corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The P drive actuator <b>16</b>P has a pair of driving members <b>15</b> (<b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b</i>). The driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed as wires of shape memory alloy (SMA) each having a circular section, and have a current-displacement characteristic of the SMA, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When passed current reaches a current value I<b>1</b>, the SMA of the driving members <b>15</b> is heated to an austenite transformation start temperature and starts deforming in the contracting direction. When the passed current reaches a current value I<b>2</b> at which the SMA is heated to the transformation end temperature, the SMA regains the stored shape and the deformation is completed. To assure excellent heat dissipation response (which will be described later) by increasing the transformation end temperature, an SMA containing titanium (Ti), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">One end of each of the driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>in the P drive actuator <b>16</b>P is fixed to an upper part of the peripheral surface of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, and the other end is fixed to the inner face of an upper part of the body-side member <b>12</b>. As will be described later, the driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>expand/contract in accordance with a heat generation amount by application of current, and drive the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the pitch direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, the driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>fixed to both of the body-side member <b>12</b> and the image capturing unit <b>9</b> are provided at both ends of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the pitch direction. That is, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> can be driven by the pair of driving members (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;SMA actuators&#x201d;) <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>connected in push-pull arrangement to the image capturing unit (movable part) <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The Y drive actuator <b>16</b>Y has a configuration similar to that of the P drive actuator <b>16</b>P. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to enable the image capturing unit <b>9</b> to be driven in the yaw direction, the Y drive actuator <b>16</b>Y has a pair of driving members <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>d </i>(not shown). The driving members <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>d </i>have a configuration similar to that of the driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, one end of the driving member <b>15</b><i>c </i>is fixed to the left side of the peripheral surface (on this side in the drawing) of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, and the other end is fixed to the inner surface of the left side of the body-side member <b>12</b>. One end of the driving member <b>15</b><i>d </i>is fixed to the right side in the peripheral surface (the back side in the drawing) of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, and the other end is fixed to the inner face of the right side of the body-side member <b>12</b>. The driving members <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>d </i>expand/contract in accordance with an amount of heat generated by application of current, thereby driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the yaw direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The drive principle of the P drive actuator <b>16</b>P will be described below. The drive principle of the Y drive actuator <b>16</b>Y is similar to that of the P drive actuator <b>16</b>P, so that it will not be described to avoid repetitive description.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing the relation between current applied to the SMA and displacement of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>. In the following description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be also referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is assumed that a relatively large current (for example, the upper limit value of the application current) is applied to the SMA (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;SMAb&#x201d;) of the drive member <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and no current is applied to SMA (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;SMAa&#x201d;) of the other drive member <b>15</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>is heated and contracted. The temperature of the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>becomes relatively low and the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>becomes vulnerable to expansion. Therefore, the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>is expanded by the contracting force of the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this state, the current applied to the SMA in the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>is decreased, and the current to the SMA in the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>is increased. As a result, the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>becomes vulnerable to expansion and the contracting force of the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>increases, so that the image capturing unit <b>9</b> gradually turns counterclockwise around the predetermined rotation axis (for example, axis RX parallel with the X axis) as a center with respect to the body-side member <b>12</b>. At the time point the powers of the SMAa and SMAb become equal to each other (currents are almost the same), the lengths of the driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>become the same. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is moved to the reference position (center position) of the driving of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in which the optical axis AX of the taking lens <b>3</b> becomes parallel with the Z axis. When the current applied to the SMA of the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>is further increased and the current applied to the SMA of the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>is further decreased, the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>further contracts and the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>further expands. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the incidence surface side of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> tilts toward upper right.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the contrary, when the current applied to the SMA of the driving member <b>15</b><i>b </i>is gradually increased while gradually decreasing the current applied to the SMA of the driving member <b>15</b><i>a </i>in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> gradually turns clockwise with respect to the body-side member <b>12</b> and changes to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> and then to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By controlling the magnitudes of the currents applied to the pair of driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>formed by the expandable SMAs, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> can be driven in both of the positive and negative directions of the pitch direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Also in the case using such a driving system, in a manner similar to the above, by driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the direction of cancelling out the shake detected by the shake sensor <b>8</b> provided for the image capturing unit <b>9</b> to move the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in relation to the body-side member <b>12</b>, a camerashake of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> can be corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To widen the drivable range for image stabilization, it is preferable to apply a predetermined current at the time of image capture so that the image capturing unit <b>9</b> exists in the center position (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the case where hysteresis exists in the displacing operation of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> by the pair of SMAs, it is sufficient to determine an input voltage or the like to compensate such hysteresis in the control system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing an outline of a control system on the image capturing process and auto image stabilization in the cellular phone <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the shake sensor <b>8</b> provided for the image capturing unit <b>9</b> supported by the elastic supporting member <b>11</b><i>a </i>detects a shake in the image capturing unit <b>9</b>. Concretely, the shake detector <b>8</b> has a gyro sensor (P shake detection gyro) <b>8</b><i>a </i>for detecting an angular speed of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the pitch direction (specifically, inertial angular velocity (angular velocity to ground)) and a gyro sensor (Y shake detection gyro) <b>8</b><i>b </i>for detecting an angular speed of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the yaw direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Output signals from the gyros <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the shake sensor <b>8</b> are input to a control unit <b>40</b><i>a</i>, amplified by a shake detection circuit <b>30</b><i>d</i>, and subjected to filtering process. The resultant signal is detected as a signal indicative of &#x201c;shake&#x201d; in the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, and input to the digital control unit <b>40</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The digital control unit <b>40</b><i>b </i>is constructed by a microcomputer and controls the driving of the image capturing unit (movable unit) <b>9</b>.

The target position setting unit <b>41</b>, present position setting unit <b>42</b>, and optimum control value computing unit <b>34</b> construct a servo control unit <b>40</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The target position setting unit <b>41</b> converts the angle information detected by the angle detecting unit <b>31</b> into position information corresponding to the position sensor <b>80</b>, and sets a target position of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present position setting unit <b>42</b> sets, as the present position of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, the position information obtained by converting an output of the position sensor <b>80</b> and detected in a position detecting unit <b>43</b>. The position sensor <b>80</b> has a P-position sensor <b>80</b><i>a </i>for detecting the position of an image capturing unit <b>9</b>B in the pitch direction, and a Y-position sensor <b>80</b><i>b </i>for detecting the position of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>B in the yaw direction. The position sensor <b>80</b> does not always have to have two one-dimensional position sensors <b>80</b><i>a </i>and <b>80</b><i>b </i>but may have one two-dimensional position sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the servo control unit <b>40</b><i>c</i>, the target position difference between the outputs of the target position setting unit <b>41</b> and the present position setting unit <b>42</b> is calculated. An optimum control value obtained by multiplying the target position difference with an optimum gain is computed by the optimum control value computing unit <b>34</b> and is output. With the optimum control value, the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is moved in the direction of cancelling off the shake detected by the shake sensor <b>8</b>. In such a manner, the shake correction can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An overall control unit <b>28</b> is a part for controlling the components of the cellular phone <b>1</b> in a centralized manner, and controls the overall sequence of the cellular phone <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The sequence control unit <b>36</b> controls the sequence of the image capturing operation using the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, image stabilizing operation, and the like.

When the release button <b>29</b> is pressed, the sequence control unit <b>36</b> shifts to an image capture state, perform AF (Auto Focus) operation and AE (Auto Exposure) operation, and sends a control signal to the servo control unit <b>40</b><i>c </i>to start the image stabilizing operation. In the image stabilizing operation, the sequence is controlled in the following order.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">(1) By receiving the angular velocity signal from the shake detection circuit <b>30</b><i>d </i>and performing predetermined integration, the angle of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is detected by the angle detecting unit <b>31</b>, and the target position of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> to be driven for the angle is set in the target position setting unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">(2) The position of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is detected by the position sensor <b>80</b>, and is set as the present position in the present position setting unit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The optimum control value is computed by the optimum control value computing unit <b>34</b> so that the present position becomes the target position, and the driving unit <b>16</b> is driven via the control value output unit <b>35</b>. Consequently, the current is applied to the driving member (SMA wires) <b>15</b> on the basis of the deviation between the target position (drive target value) and the present position (measurement value), so that the driving of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> is properly servo-controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">By repeating the operations (1) to (3) until an image stabilization stop instruction is received, proper image stabilization can be performed.</p>

Since the application voltages necessary for holding the image capturing unit <b>9</b> in the center vary depending on the state of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>, it is preferable to grasp and store the application voltage information for the driving members in which the variations are considered before shipment from factory or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, the control unit <b>40</b><i>a </i>generates a control instruction value for driving the image capturing unit <b>9</b> so as to cancel out a shake detected by the shake detection circuit <b>30</b><i>d </i>by using the servo control unit <b>40</b><i>c </i>and the control value output unit <b>35</b>, and outputs the control instruction value to a driver <b>30</b><i>e</i>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are diagrams illustrating operations of the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the signal waveform in the target position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows signal waveforms Ja and Jb of the voltages applied to the SMAa and SMAb, respectively.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the case where the target position signal in the sine wave shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is set, the control unit <b>40</b><i>a </i>in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> generates a drive control signal for applying a voltage having a waveform Ja in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> to the SMAa, and also generates a drive control signal for applying a voltage having a waveform Jb of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> to the SMAb. When the driver <b>30</b><i>e </i>continuously applies current to the SMAa and SMAb on the basis of the signal waveforms Ja and Jb, continuous displacements can be given to the image capturing unit <b>9</b>. The characteristics of the signal waveforms Ja and Jb will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The signal waveforms Ja and Jb are analog signals which set, as a bias voltage Bs, a predetermined DC voltage necessary for applying a necessary current in the SMA transformation temperature range shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and are vibrated using the bias voltage Bs as a reference in accordance with the target position signal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The bias current value is set as a current value necessary for heating the SMA to a specific temperature in a temperature range from the SMA transformation start temperature to the transformation end temperature. For example, a current value Im as an intermediate value of the current values I<b>1</b> and I<b>2</b> as the upper and lower limits in the SMA transformation temperature range shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is set.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the case where a signal waveform Ps<b>1</b> for displacing the image capturing unit <b>9</b> to the positive (+) side in a time zone t<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) is input, for the SMAa requiring the expanding/contracting operation, the control unit <b>40</b><i>a </i>outputs a drive control signal obtained by adding a voltage value proportional to the signal waveform Ps<b>1</b> like the signal waveform Ja<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> to the bias voltage Bs to the driver <b>30</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">On the other hand, for the SMAb which does not have to contract but expands, in the case where heat dissipation speed of the SMA is equal to the heating speed, a voltage value &#x201c;a&#x201d; added to the bias voltage Bs in the signal waveform Ja<b>1</b> is subtracted from the bias voltage Bs like the signal waveform Jb<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> in the time zone t<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By setting the bias voltage Bs and preventing the SMA to expand from being excessively cooled, also in the case of heating the SMA (the time zone t<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), a time lag of heating can be reduced, and response can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For the driving member <b>15</b>, SMA having a proper wire diameter has to be used in consideration of restrictions of (1) driving force, (2) installablility, and (3) response. The restrictions will be described one by one.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(1) Driving Force</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The driving force (maximum driving force) which can be generated by the SMA is almost proportional to the sectional area of the SMA. For example, the maximum driving force of the SMA having a wire diameter of &#x3c6; 40 &#x3bc;m is about 0.6N (power of about 60 g) in actual measurement. To assure target image stabilization performance in the servo mechanism such as the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>, when variations among individual driving mechanisms, frictional force, posture, and the like are considered, it is the limit for the SMA having the wire diameter of &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m to drive the movable part of about 5 g.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">On the other hand, in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>, it is difficult to set the mass of the movable part to about 0.5 g or less. To reliably drive the movable part of 0.5 g, a wire diameter of &#x3c6;12.6 (=40&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over (0.5/5)}) &#x3bc;m is necessary on the basis of the actual measurement value of &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">From the above, to assure a proper driving force in the image stabilization, preferably, the wire diameter of the SMA is set to about &#x3c6;15 &#x3bc;m or more.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(2) Installability</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the case of using the SMA as an actuator, both ends of the SMA (driving members <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b</i>) have to be fixed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. To attach the SMA with stable power, the wire diameter of &#x3c6;10 &#x3bc;m or more is necessary. When the wire diameter is less than &#x3c6;10 &#x3bc;m, the SMA is too thin, and workability is low. It is difficult to fix the SMA while giving predetermined stress.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(3) Response</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>, the response is improved by applying the bias voltage Bs to the SMAa and SMAb. In the SMA to be expanded different from the SMA which contracts, heat has to be dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As for heat dissipation of the SMA, the sectional area of the SMA and heat dissipation response (heat dissipation velocity) have the relation of proportion or higher. The smaller the sectional area or the diameter of the SMA is, the higher the heat dissipation is.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, when the SMA having the wire diameter of &#x3c6; 40 &#x3bc;m is actually measured, the SMA has heat dissipation response of about 50 Hz at the ambient temperature of 25&#xb0; C. (room temperature). When the temperature becomes a high temperature of 60&#xb0; C., the heat dissipation response decreases to about 40 Hz and deteriorates by about 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore, when it is considered that the response has to be proportional to the sectional area of the SMA in order to assure necessary response in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b> (for example, response of about 10 Hz at high temperature), the wire diameter of the SMA has to be set to &#x3c6;80 (=40&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over ((40/10))}) &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The response will be considered by conducting a simulation on a driving mechanism for linearly driving the movable part (hereinbelow, also called &#x201c;linear driving mechanism&#x201d;) by the SMA actuator in the push-pull arrangement.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">First, when a control signal is input, the control signal is amplified by a servo amplifier B<b>1</b>, and a voltage V is output.

Since the processes of current, heat generation, and generation of driving force are performed in the SMA actuator, the characteristic B<b>3</b> is a system of second lag. The force F generated by the SMA acts on the movable part, thereby generating a driving speed &#x201c;v&#x201d; based on a driving characteristic B of the movable part. By performing an integration B<b>5</b> on the driving speed &#x201c;v&#x201d;, the position P of the movable part is obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, by performing the position feedback (servo control) of the movable part in a driving mechanism, the frequency characteristic to 100 Hz is improved as compared with that in the open control shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. Since the wire diameter is &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m, the heat dissipation response in the SMA actuator on the heat dissipation side is excellent. A phase delay at around 10 Hz is also suppressed to about 7&#xb0; (refer to point Db on the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>), so that target response of the image stabilization (for example, a phase delay at 10 Hz is 8&#xb0; or less) is satisfied. Although mechanical resonance Ca occurs at around 120 Hz due to the relation between the mass of the movable part and the spring component, it is resonance at a frequency higher than the frequency necessary for the image stabilization. Consequently, it can be improved by a mechanical damper or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0112">In consideration of the simulation results, it is understood that preferable wire diameter of the SMA actuator is &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m or less from the viewpoint of response.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0118">Since voltages are applied to the SMAa and SMAb on the basis of the signal waveforms La and Lb thinned-out by using the pulse signals Pt, power can be reduced according to the ratio (duty ratio) between on-time and off-time of the pulse signals Pt.

By setting the carrier frequency of the pulse signal to a sufficiently high frequency (for example, 1 kHz or higher) with respect to the response of the SMA, the carrier frequency is suppressed to the level at which the influence of a driving error caused by trace to the pulse signal itself can be ignored.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0128">The auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A is constructed as a two-dimensional swing mechanism, and includes a rectangular-parallelepiped image capturing unit (movable part) <b>9</b>A having a configuration similar to that of the image capturing unit <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and a body-side member <b>17</b> fixed to the body side of the cellular phone and corresponding to the body-side member <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The image capturing unit <b>9</b>A has the taking lens <b>3</b>, the position sensor, and the like in a manner similar to the image capturing unit <b>9</b> but is different from the image capturing unit <b>9</b> with respect to the point that the image pickup device <b>5</b> is provided on the outside of the casing of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A. Although not shown, the shake sensor <b>8</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is attached to the outside wall of the body-side member <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0129">The auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A has two elastic deforming parts <b>13</b> (<b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>) such as elastic hinges and a pair of driving members <b>14</b> (<b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>) formed as wires of the SMA. By the elastic deforming parts <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the image capturing unit <b>9</b><i>a </i>can swing in the pitch direction Rp and the yaw direction Ry.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0130">Both ends of the driving member <b>14</b><i>a </i>functioning as the SMA actuator are fixed to two terminals <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> of the body-side member <b>17</b>, and both ends of the driving member <b>14</b><i>b </i>are fixed to the terminal <b>95</b> and a terminal <b>96</b> of the body-side member <b>17</b>. The driving member <b>14</b><i>a </i>is in contact with a columnar projection <b>93</b> provided for the body-side member <b>17</b> and is retained by a columnar projection <b>91</b> provided for the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A.

<p id="p-0119" num="0131">In the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A having such a configuration, when current is passed to the driving member <b>14</b><i>a </i>via the terminals <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>, the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A swings in the positive (+) direction Rpa of the pitch direction around the elastic deforming part <b>13</b><i>a </i>as a center by the contracting/expanding operations of the driving member <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the driving member <b>14</b><i>b </i>connected in the push-pull relation with respect to swing in the pitch direction Rp of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A, and the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A is moved to, for example, a position Pa. On the other hand, when current is passed to the driving member <b>14</b><i>b </i>via the terminals <b>95</b> and <b>96</b>, the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A swings in the negative (&#x2212;) direction Rpb of the pitch direction around the elastic deforming part <b>13</b><i>a </i>as a center by the contracting operation of the driving member <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the expanding operation of the driving member <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A is moved to, for example, a position Pb.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0132">The image capturing unit <b>9</b>A can be also moved (swung) in the yaw direction Ry, although not shown, by a configuration similar to that in the pitch direction Py.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0133">In such an auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A, the size of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A including the lens <b>3</b> is large to a certain degree. Consequently, a distance Lb from the rotation center of the elastic deforming part <b>13</b><i>a </i>to center Gv of gravity (point of application) of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A becomes longer than a distance La from the rotation center of the elastic deforming part <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the projection (power point) <b>91</b>. To be concrete, in many cases, (Lb/La)&#x2267;about 1.5. In such cases, equivalent mass (apparent mass) of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A becomes (Lb/La) times, so that it causes deterioration in response. Deterioration in response will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0134">The frequency fc of mechanical resonance in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A is expressed by the following equation (1) when spring constant determined according to the sectional area or the like of the driving member <b>14</b> is expressed as Kb and the equivalent mass of the image capturing unit is expressed as &#x201c;m&#x201d;.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>fc</i>=(&#xbd;&#x3c0;)&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over ((<i>Kb/m</i>))}&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0135">Therefore, in the case where the equivalent mass &#x201c;m&#x201d; of the image capturing unit becomes 1.5 times, the resonance frequency fc drops by about 20%. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the frequency characteristics of solid lines corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> degrade to frequency characteristics of virtual lines, and the resonance frequency drops from 120 Hz to around 100 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0136">Since the response deteriorates due to increase in the equivalent mass, in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A, by improving the shape of the driving member <b>14</b>, heat dissipation improves and, accordingly, response improves.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram showing the relation between ellipticity of the driving member <b>14</b> and cooling time.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0138">The ellipticity expresses &#x201c;length of minor axis: length of major axis&#x201d; of the sectional shape (ellipse shape) of the driving member <b>14</b>. As the cooling time, time (measurement result) required to cool the driving member <b>14</b> having the same sectional area from 70&#xb0; C. to about 40&#xb0; C. is expressed as a reference (100%) in case 1.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0139">The more the ellipticity increases, the more the cooling time is shortened. It is because the heat dissipation improves due to shortening of the distance from the surface in the shorter direction to the center (of gravity) of the driving member <b>14</b> and increase in the surface area of the driving member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0140">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the cooling time in case 3 in which the section has an ellipse shape and the ellipticity is 1:1.35 is shorter than that in case 1 by about 20%. Since the sectional areas of the driving member <b>14</b> in the cases 1 and 3 are the same, driving forces generated by current application and the spring constant Kb in Equation (1) are also the same.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0141">Therefore, improvement in response proportional to shortening of the cooling time can be expected. To maintain the driving performance by recovering the resonance frequency fc lowered by about 20% in the SMA having a circular section in the case where the equivalent mass of the image capturing unit becomes 1.5 times, it is sufficient to increase the ratio of the length of the major axis to the length of the minor axis in the ellipse section of the driving member <b>14</b> by 1.3 times or more.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0142">That is, by employing the driving member (SMA actuator) <b>14</b> in which a value obtained by dividing the width in the longer direction of the wire section by the width in the shorter direction is 1.3 or larger in the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A, the response of the SMA actuator can be properly improved. In consideration of the installability and response, the sectional area of the SMA actuator is, preferably, in the range of 80 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>to 5,030 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and, more preferably, in the range of 180 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>to 1,260 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0143">The driving member (SMA actuator) <b>14</b> does not have to be constructed as a wire having an ellipse-shaped section but may be constructed as a wire having a rectangular-shaped section. Also in the case of using such a band-shaped wire, by setting a value obtained by dividing the width in the longer direction of the wire section by the width in the shorter direction to be 1.3 or larger, heat dissipation of the SMA is increased, and the response can be properly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0144">With respect to deterioration in response due to increase in the equivalent mass of the image capturing unit <b>9</b>A, the response may be improved by using two or more driving members <b>14</b> having a circular section.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0145">Specifically, two driving members <b>14</b> each having a circular section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> are stretched in parallel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>. Concretely, two SMA wires are stretched so as to be adjacent to each other along a stretch route (the same stretch route) Kt<b>1</b> of the driving member <b>14</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and two SMA wires are stretched so as to be adjacent to each other along a stretch route Kt<b>2</b> of the driving member <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Since the driving forces generated in the adjacent SMAs have to be made equal to each other, it is requested to attach the SMAs having the same length to the terminals <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> and the like with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0146">By stretching the two driving members <b>14</b> having the same wire diameter in parallel with each other, the total sectional area is doubled (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>), and the driving force by current application can be doubled (the spring constant Kb in the equation (1) can be also doubled). Consequently, also in the case where the equivalent mass of the image capturing unit becomes 1.5 times or more, the response can be recovered by doubling the driving force. Even when the two driving members <b>14</b> are used, the heat dissipation is equivalent to that in the case of using one driving member <b>14</b>, so that response in heat dissipation does not deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0147">It is not essential to stretch two driving members <b>14</b> in parallel with each other but three or more driving members <b>14</b> may be stretched. In this case as well, increase in the driving force according to the number of the driving members <b>14</b> can be expected, so that response improves.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0148">In the configuration of the auto image stabilization system <b>10</b>A in the foregoing embodiment, it is not essential to provide two SMAs (driving members <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>) in the push-pull arrangement for the movable part (image capturing unit <b>9</b>A). Alternatively, one elastic member such as a coil spring that can expand and gives energizing force, for example, in the contraction direction and one SMA may be provided in the push-pull arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0149">While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
