<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electric massage shoe assembly and each shoe includes a conductive insole powered by a power supply set so as to provide vibration at different points to the wearer's feet.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional way to massage the feet is to walk or stand on a pad on which a plurality of bosses protrude, the bosses stimulate the reflecting points of the feet to improve the blood circulation and even stimulate different parts of user's body. Nevertheless, a common experience is that the bosses really hurt the feet because they are stiff. If the sizes of the bosses are reduced or are made softer, the massage result is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional electric massage shoe assembly <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and generally includes a shoe having an insole <b>52</b> received therein and a receptacle <b>511</b> is defined through the counter <b>51</b> of the shoe. A power supply set <b>53</b> is provided which has a cable <b>531</b> connected thereto and an end of the cable <b>531</b> is plugged into the receptacle <b>511</b> so as to electrically connect the conductive wire in the shoe. The insole <b>52</b> is a solid plate with a plurality of bosses on a top surface thereof which is in contact with the wearer's foot. The bosses are connected with the wire so that the electricity stimulates the wearer's foot when the power supply set <b>53</b> is set to &#x201c;ON&#x201d; so as to have massage feature.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the solid insole <b>52</b> is stiff so that the wearer cannot feel comfortable after standing for a period of time. Besides, the power supply set <b>53</b> is not convenient for carrying and the length of the cable <b>531</b> limits the convenience of the use of the massage shoe assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention intends to provide electric massage shoes wherein the power supply set is compact and easily to carry so as to provide adjustable vibration to the wearer's feet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to an electric massage shoe assembly which comprises a shoe and a conductive unit is received in the shoe. The conductive unit has a receptacle, at least one conductive rod and a first wire connected between the receptacle and the at least one conductive rod. An insole unit is received in the shoe and includes a first part and a second part which is overlapped on the first part. The at least one conductive rod extends through a through hole defined through the first part and is in contact with wearer's foot. A frequency current generating unit has two plugs, a frequency current generating member and two second wires connected between the two plugs and the frequency current generating member. One of the two plugs is connected with the receptacle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the first embodiment of the electric massage shoe assembly of the present invention comprises a pair of shoes <b>10</b> and an aperture <b>11</b> is defined through a heel portion <b>100</b> of each of the shoes <b>10</b>. A conductive unit <b>20</b> is received in the shoe <b>10</b> and includes a receptacle <b>21</b>, a first wire <b>22</b> and at least one conductive rod <b>24</b>, wherein the first wire <b>22</b> connected between the receptacle <b>21</b> and the at least one conductive rod <b>24</b>. The conductive rod <b>24</b> is connected on a top of a conductive plate <b>23</b> which is connected to the first wire <b>22</b> and located opposite the receptacle <b>21</b>. The at least one conductive rod <b>24</b> and the conductive plate <b>23</b> are made by flexible conductive material such as conductive silicone, conductive rubber, conductive fabric or conductive metal sheet. The receptacle <b>21</b> of the conductive unit <b>20</b> is inserted in the aperture <b>11</b>. A groove <b>12</b> is defined the inside of the shoe <b>10</b> and communicates with the aperture <b>11</b>. The first wire <b>22</b> is received in the groove <b>12</b> and the receptacle <b>21</b> is inserted in the aperture <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An insole unit <b>30</b> is received in the shoe <b>10</b> and has a first part <b>31</b> and a second part <b>33</b> which is overlapped on the first part <b>31</b>. The first part <b>31</b> is made by foam material or soft rubber. The conductive unit <b>20</b> is located between the first part <b>31</b> and an inside of the shoe <b>10</b>. A through hole <b>311</b> is defined through the first part <b>31</b> and the at least one conductive rod <b>24</b> extends through the through hole <b>311</b>. A conductive mediate part <b>32</b> can be located between the first and second parts <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>. The conductive mediate part <b>32</b> is in contact with the conductive rod <b>24</b> and includes a plurality of protrusions <b>321</b> on a top thereof. The second part <b>33</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>331</b> through which the protrusions <b>321</b> extend so as to contact the wearer's feet.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A frequency current generating unit <b>40</b> has two plugs <b>41</b>, a frequency current generating member <b>43</b> and two second wires <b>42</b> connected between the two plugs <b>41</b> and the frequency current generating member <b>43</b>. The two plugs <b>41</b> are respectively connected with the two receptacles <b>21</b> of the two shoes <b>10</b>. The frequency current generated by the frequency current generating unit <b>40</b> is transferred to the metal mediate parts <b>32</b> in the two shoes <b>10</b> so as to stimulate the wearer's feet via the protrusions <b>321</b>. The frequency can be adjusted by the wearer when needed. The frequency current generating unit <b>40</b> is compact and portable so that the wearer can normally walks or even go jogging while the massage function is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the second embodiment of the electric massage shoe assembly of the present invention, wherein a recessed path <b>16</b> is vertically defined in an inside of a counter <b>15</b> of the shoe <b>10</b> and a groove <b>12</b> is defined the inside of the shoe <b>10</b> and communicates with the recessed path <b>16</b>. The first wires <b>22</b> are received in the groove <b>12</b> and the recessed path <b>16</b>, the receptacle <b>21</b> is located in the recessed path <b>16</b> and on a top edge of the counter <b>15</b>. Therefore, the plugs <b>14</b> are vertically inserted into the receptacles <b>21</b> and will not be tangled by foreign objects during walking.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the third embodiment of the electric massage shoe assembly of the present invention, wherein the aperture <b>11</b> is defined through the heel portion <b>100</b> of each shoe <b>10</b>. The conductive rod <b>24</b> is composed of two portions which are securely connected to each other as a rivet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that the electric massage shoe assembly of the present invention can also be cooperated with a pair of slippers with the aperture <b>11</b> defined in the heel portion <b>100</b>. The slippers each have the insole unit <b>30</b> and only the second part <b>33</b> and the protrusions <b>321</b> are seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a fourth embodiment of the electric massage shoe assembly of the present invention wherein each shoe <b>10</b> has a pocket <b>17</b> defined therein which can be sealed by a zipper and two frequency current generating unit <b>40</b> are respectively received in the two pockets <b>17</b> of the shoes <b>10</b> so as to respectively activate the conductive units <b>20</b> in the two shoes <b>10</b>. The insole unit <b>30</b> in each shoe <b>10</b> is the same as the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The frequency current generating unit <b>40</b> is controlled by a remote control <b>45</b>, therefore no connecting wires are necessary and thus provides more flexibility for wearers while moving.</p>
