<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The Snake Fence (<b>1</b>), especially for catching snakes. The netting is attached to upright staking material (<b>2</b>) which is hammered into the ground. The netting follows the staking material and is attached to the staking material (<b>3</b>) and then secured to the ground by fasteners (<b>4</b>). It is the single, double, or multiple layering of netting that catches the snakes and holds the snakes. The snakes cannot extricate themselves from the netting. The netting is proportional in size to the snake being caught; the staking material is proportional in size to the netting; the fasteners are proportional in size to the staking material.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The snake fence consists of differing lengths of hard upright stakes (<b>1</b>C) placed in the ground with a polyethylene or polyurethane extruded netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) of one or more layers fastened to the stake (<b>1</b>C) at various intervals to secure the netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) to the upright (<b>1</b>C) to firmly hold together insuring the integrity of the fence to be able to entrap a snake; the size of the opening of the netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) has to be proportionately smaller than the diameter of the snake being caught. There are various sizes of the snake fence to accommodate the various sizes and shapes of snakes' heads and bodies. The netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) of the snake fence is attached to the ground (<b>1</b>E) at various intervals by fasteners (<b>1</b>F) that hold down the netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) and prevent the snake from crawling under the netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) of the snake fence. The fasteners (<b>1</b>F) also secure the netting (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) of the snake fence to the ground to insure the length and integrity of the snake fence.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is the purpose of this invention to catch snakes by incorporating netting, upright staking material, and fasteners of various sizes which are dependent on the size of the snake to be caught. The netting is held by the firm upright staking material which is affixed by fasteners to the netting and the stakes are hammered into the ground. The installation and maintenance is very simple.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawing denotes generally the present invention front and back view which is comprised of steel upright stakes <b>1</b>C, poly netting <b>1</b>A/<b>1</b>B, fasteners <b>1</b>D, and ground staples <b>1</b>F. The steel upright stakes <b>1</b>C are round. The poly netting <b>1</b>A/<b>1</b>B is either polyethylene or polyurethane with openings in the mesh determined by the horizontal and vertical grid pattern which has to be slightly smaller than the snake to be caught. The fasteners <b>1</b>D are rings which attach the poly netting <b>1</b>A/<b>1</b>B to the steel upright stakes <b>1</b>C at intervals appropriate to the size and weight of the poly netting <b>1</b>A/<b>1</b>B. The ground staples <b>1</b>F are U-shaped and placed in the ground at intervals appropriate to keep the poly netting <b>1</b>A/<b>1</b>B flush with the ground <b>1</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawing denotes generally the present invention over-head view which is comprised of steel upright stakes <b>2</b>A, poly netting <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C, and ground staples <b>2</b>D. The steel upright stakes <b>2</b>A are placed into the ground vertically and at intervals sufficient to support the poly netting <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C. The steel upright stakes <b>2</b>A are directly attached to the two layers of poly netting <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C and the layers of poly netting <b>2</b>A/<b>2</b>B are horizontally spaced apart by the circumference of the stakes <b>2</b>A. The U-shaped ground staples <b>2</b>D attach the poly netting <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C to the ground by holding the netting firmly by the horizontal top of the staple <b>2</b>D so as not to allow anything to be between the poly netting <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C and the ground; this prevents the snake from crawling under the snake fence.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawing denotes generally the present invention end view which is comprised of steel upright stakes <b>3</b>C, poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B, fasteners <b>3</b>D, and ground staples <b>3</b>E. The poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B should be smooth and fairly taut between the steel upright stakes <b>3</b>C; the tensile strength of the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B should be sufficiently strong enough to hold a snake once it is caught in the netting. It is the nature of the snake to try and go through the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B and not around it; the snake will become caught up in the netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B when it has approximately one-third of its body caught up in the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B the snake will try to back out of the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B but cannot because the scales on the underbelly of the snake get hung up on the woven mesh of the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B. The horizontal and vertical weave of the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B is dependent on the size of snake to be caught. The spacing of the steel upright stakes <b>3</b>C is five foot. The number of fasteners <b>3</b>D is dependent on the size of poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B which is dependent on the size of snake to be caught with a minimum of five fasteners to each stake <b>3</b>C. The number of ground staples <b>3</b>E needed is dependent on the ground surface with a more challenging surface requiring more staples <b>3</b>E to keep the poly netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B flush to the ground so as to prevent the snake from crawling under the netting <b>3</b>A/<b>3</b>B.</p>
