<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to medical examination tables and, more particularly, to a medical examination table which is vertically movable between a lowered patient entry/exit position and a raised patient examination position via a motorized lift assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Medical examination tables are known to have a patient-supporting surface comprising a seat portion and an adjustable backrest portion. The backrest portion is movable between a horizontal position and an inclined position so that a patient is supported in an upright position during certain examination procedures. Motorized lift assemblies have been used with examination tables to vertically raise and lower the entire patient supporting surface of the table so that in a lowered position, a patient can enter or exit the examination table. The examination table can be vertically raised by the lift assembly to a height suitable for a particular medical examination or procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One drawback with known medical examination tables is that the table's patient-supporting surface is spaced a significant distance above the floor even when the table is lowered to its lowest patient entry/exit position. When the patient supporting surface is spaced a significant distance above the floor, small children, elderly patients or disabled patients often require assistance in order to get on top of the supporting surface before the supporting surface is raised for the examination. Sometimes more than one assistant is required to lift a patient from a wheelchair to the patient supporting surface on top of the medical examination table even when the examination table is lowered to its lowest position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another drawback encountered with known medical examination tables is that the examination table lacks a surface on which the physician may conveniently place medical instruments needed during an examination. Typically, the examining physician must have an assistant hold a tray with all the instruments needed during an examination or the instruments are placed on a table located near the examination table. The instrument supporting table takes up valuable space in the examination room and may be accidentally jarred by the physician or assistant so that the instruments may become contaminated and/or difficult for the physician to reach when the instruments are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another drawback with known medical examination tables is that the examination tables lack sufficient storage space for rolls of paper towels and other bulky items required for the examination or for clean-up of the examination area. Such bulky items are typically stored in cabinets in the examination room but that storage space is generally limited.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for a medical examination table that improves patient entry or exit while providing comfort to the patient during movement of the medical examination table between entry/exit and examination and treatment positions. There is also a need for a medical examination table that improves a physician's access to medical instruments and other items needed during an examination. There is yet also a need for an examination table that improves storage of bulky items required for the examination and clean-up of the examination area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention overcomes the foregoing and other shortcomings and drawbacks of medical examination tables heretofore known. While the invention will be described in connection with certain embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention includes all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention comprises a medical examination table which is movable between a lowered patient entry/exit position and a raised patient examination position. The medical examination table of the present invention has three principal components: a base, a table assembly located above the base and a scissor-lift assembly which functions to raise and lower the table assembly relative to the base. The motorized scissor-lift assembly includes a motorized drive assembly and a scissor mechanism extending between the base and the table assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The table assembly includes a generally rectangular upper frame, a seat assembly secured to the upper frame at a front thereof, and a backrest assembly secured to the upper frame at a rear end thereof. The backrest assembly includes a backrest support movable between a horizontal position and an inclined position to enable a patient to sit up while being examined. A backrest is secured to the backrest support and a seat is secured to the seat assembly. The upper surfaces of the backrest and seat provide a patient support surface which supports the patient for examination purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the backrest assembly includes a storage pocket adapted to house medical equipment and supplies, such as rolls of paper towels and other bulky items. The storage pocket and its contents are concealed when the backrest support and attached backrest are in their lowered position. When the backrest support and backrest attached thereto are raised, the contents of the storage pocket are easily accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the seat assembly includes a pull-out drawer which defines a storage area for medical instruments and other necessary accessories. The pull-out drawer has a front panel which is pivotally mounted to the drawer. The front panel is pivoted between a vertical position lying generally parallel to a front wall of the drawer and a generally horizontal position lying generally transverse to the front wall of the drawer. In its lowered or downward position, the front panel may be used as a tray to support medical instruments or other items required by a physician during an examination. When the front cover is pivoted downwardly into a generally horizontal position, it may function as a rest or support for medical instruments being used for purposes of the examination.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a scissor-life assembly extends between the base and the upper frame of the table assembly. This scissor-lift assembly comprises two sets of legs, with the first set of legs being pivotally secured to the second set of legs. The first set of legs has forward ends which are pivotally secured to the base at fixed locations at the front of the base. These legs extend upwardly and have rear ends to which non-rotatable bearings are attached. The bearings are adapted to move in horizontally oriented slides which are fixed to the inside surfaces of the upper frame of the table assembly. Likewise, each of the second set of legs have forward ends pivotally secured at fixed locations to the front of the upper frame. The rear ends of each of the second set of legs have similar non-rotatable bearings attached thereto which are adapted to move in horizontally oriented slides which are fixed to inside surfaces of the base. When the table assembly is raised and lowered, the bearings slide inside the slides in a horizontal manner thereby causing the legs to move and the table assembly to raise or lower relative to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A motorized drive assembly is used to move the table assembly upwardly and downwardly relative to the base. The drive assembly comprises a pivotal motor having a horizontally oriented output shaft connected to a gear box. The output shaft of the motor drives an actuator through the gear box. A lower end of the actuator is pivotally secured to the base and is operatively coupled to the motor which functions to rotate the actuator which is a threaded ball screw in one embodiment of the present invention. The actuator is threadably engaged with a nut and a block mounted to the nut so that rotation of the actuator causes the nut and block to travel along the length of the actuator. The block is secured to one of the sets of legs so that movement of the block by the actuator causes the table assembly to move upwardly or downwardly relative to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the table assembly is lowered, the bearings secured to the first and second sets of legs move rearwardly inside the slides attached to the base and upper frame of the table assembly. As the examination table is lowered, the actuator and its associated drive motor pivot downwardly so that the actuator and drive motor nest within an internal cavity defined by the base. In its lowermost patient entry/exit position, the patient support surface is located approximately eighteen (18) inches above the ground to provide a convenient and safe entry and exit position for the patient. In its uppermost position, the patient support surface is located approximately thirty-seven 37) inches above the ground to provide a convenient examination position of the patient for the physician.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following drawings.</p>

The operation of the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base <b>12</b> has an internal cavity <b>18</b> defined by a pair of side members <b>19</b>, a rear member <b>20</b>, a front member <b>22</b> and a base bottom <b>24</b>. A pair of slides <b>26</b> are mounted to the side members <b>19</b> of the base <b>12</b> and are exposed through the inside surfaces <b>28</b> of the side members <b>19</b>. The details of each slide <b>26</b> and its operation is described in greater detail below. Each of the slides <b>26</b> is adapted to receive and retain a non-rotatable bearing <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>) which is part of the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The table assembly <b>14</b> of the present invention is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>5</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the table assembly <b>14</b> comprises an upper frame <b>32</b> which is generally rectangular in shape. The upper frame <b>32</b> comprises two side frame members <b>34</b>, a rear frame member <b>36</b> secured to the side frame members <b>34</b> and extending therebetween, and a front pivot bar <b>38</b> which passes through collars <b>40</b> located in the side frame members <b>34</b>. Secured to each of the side frame members <b>34</b> is a slide <b>26</b> which is exposed through the inside surface <b>42</b> of each side frame member <b>34</b>. Slides <b>26</b> are adapted to receive and retain the non-rotatable bearings <b>30</b> of the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, the table assembly <b>14</b> further comprises a seat assembly <b>50</b> secured to the upper frame <b>32</b> at the front thereof. The seat assembly <b>50</b> includes a housing <b>52</b> which supports a pull-out fluid collection pan <b>54</b>. The pull-out fluid collection pan <b>54</b> is movable between a closed position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and an extended position illustrated in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pull-out fluid collection pan <b>54</b> has a centrally located recess or well <b>56</b> adapted to house and store fluids resulting from an examination occurring on the table <b>10</b>. In order to pull out the collection pan <b>54</b>, a physician grasps a front lip <b>58</b> of the collection pan <b>54</b> and pulls in the direction of arrow <b>60</b> until the collection pan <b>54</b> has been fully extended. The collection pan <b>54</b> may then be pushed inwardly to its closed position once it has been used and adequately cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the seat assembly <b>50</b> includes a pull out drawer assembly <b>61</b>, illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The drawer assembly <b>61</b> comprises a drawer housing <b>62</b> having an interior <b>63</b> defined by a housing bottom <b>64</b>, a rear wall <b>65</b> and side walls <b>66</b> having inner surfaces <b>67</b> to which are secured tracks <b>68</b>. Slide members <b>69</b> are mounted to slide inside the tracks <b>68</b> in a conventional manner. Each slide member <b>69</b> comprises a first section <b>70</b> and a second section <b>71</b> adapted to move inside the first section <b>70</b>. Securing brackets <b>72</b> (only one being shown) are secured to the second sections <b>71</b> of the slide members <b>69</b>. Each of the securing brackets <b>72</b> has a series of spaces slots <b>73</b> integrally formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A drawer <b>74</b> having an interior <b>75</b> for the storage of medical instruments and any other necessary accessories, is adapted to be removably secured to the securing brackets <b>72</b>. The drawer's storage interior <b>75</b> is defined by a drawer bottom <b>76</b>, a back wall <b>77</b>, side walls <b>78</b>, and a front wall <b>79</b> having a cutout <b>80</b> formed therein. A front panel <b>81</b> is hingedly secured to the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> in a manner described in greater detail below so that the front panel <b>81</b> is pivotal between a vertical position lying generally parallel to the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b>, and a horizontal position lying generally traverse to the front wall of the drawer <b>74</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The side walls <b>78</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> have a series of spaced ribs <b>82</b> adapted to be received in the slots <b>73</b> of the securing brackets <b>72</b>. Thus, the drawer <b>74</b> may be lowered into a fixed position between the securing brackets <b>72</b>, with the ribs <b>82</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> being engaged in the slots <b>73</b> of the securing brackets <b>72</b>. When the drawer needs to be cleaned, it may be lifted vertically, with the ribs <b>82</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> being disengaged from the slots <b>73</b> of the securing brackets <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a conventional manner, the drawer <b>74</b> may be pulled outwardly from a closed position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to an extended position illustrated in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> by a physician grasping a handle <b>5</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, located on the front side of the front panel <b>81</b> of the drawer <b>74</b>. The front panel <b>81</b> is hingedly mounted to the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> about a pin <b>85</b> which defines a horizontally-oriented pivot axis A<b>1</b> about which the front panel <b>81</b> may rotate. More particularly, the front panel <b>81</b> has a circular hinge portion <b>83</b> which rotates through an opening <b>84</b> formed in the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b>. The front panel <b>81</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> is movable between an upward or raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in which it covers the cutout <b>80</b> formed in the drawer's front wall <b>79</b>, to a downward or lowered position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in which the front panel <b>81</b> may be used as a tray to support medical instruments (not shown) or other items required by a physician during an examination procedure. The inside surface <b>6</b> of the front panel <b>81</b> has a depression <b>7</b> formed therein which aids in preventing the medical instruments (not shown) from falling off the front panel <b>81</b> when the front panel <b>81</b> is used as an instrument support tray, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hinge portion <b>83</b> of the front panel <b>81</b> includes a pair of resilient latches <b>84</b> that engage an inner surface of the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b> when the front panel <b>81</b> is folded to its downward or lowered position. For safety purposes, the latches <b>84</b> are designed to disengage from the front wall <b>79</b> when a load of approximately ten (10) pounds is exerted downwardly on the front panel <b>81</b> so that the front panel <b>81</b> collapses downwardly. In this way, the latches <b>84</b> prevent the front panel <b>81</b> from being damaged in the event the front panel <b>81</b> is overloaded or stepped upon. The front panel <b>81</b> is returned to its operative position simply by reengaging the latches <b>84</b> with the front wall <b>79</b> of the drawer <b>74</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> of the present invention is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> is secured to the upper frame <b>32</b> of the table assembly <b>14</b> and the base <b>16</b>. The scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> comprises a first set <b>100</b> of legs <b>102</b>. Each of the legs <b>102</b> is pivotally secured at lower ends thereof to the base <b>12</b> about a horizontal axis A<b>2</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Tubes <b>104</b> extending outwardly from the lower ends of the legs <b>102</b> are received in the side members <b>19</b> of the base at a fixed location (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.). At the upper opposite ends of the legs <b>102</b> is a shaft <b>106</b> extending therebetween to which are secured the non-rotatable bearings <b>30</b> outside of the legs <b>102</b>. The bearings <b>30</b> are received inside the slides <b>26</b> secured to the upper frame <b>32</b> and slide therein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second set <b>108</b> of legs <b>110</b> are fixedly secured to the side frame members <b>34</b> of the upper frame <b>32</b> via the front pivot bar <b>38</b>. The front pivot bar <b>38</b> defines another horizontal pivot axis A<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Additional non-rotatable bearings <b>30</b> are attached to the outer ends of a shaft <b>107</b> extending between the lower ends of the legs <b>110</b>. The bearings <b>30</b> (only one being shown) attached to the shaft <b>107</b> are adapted to slide inside the slides <b>26</b> attached to the side members <b>19</b> of the base <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.). The first set <b>100</b> of legs <b>102</b> and the second set <b>108</b> of legs <b>110</b> are pivotally connected together generally at a midpoint of the legs <b>102</b> and <b>110</b> with a shaft <b>112</b> which defines another horizontal pivot axis A<b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a drive assembly <b>114</b> of the present invention which forms part of the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b>. The drive assembly <b>114</b> comprises a pivotal motor <b>115</b> having a horizontally oriented output shaft <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) connected to a gear box <b>117</b>. The motor <b>115</b> is operated by a foot pedal <b>118</b> located at the front of the base <b>12</b>. Activation of the motor <b>115</b> by the foot pedal <b>118</b> rotates the motor output shaft <b>116</b> which drives an actuator <b>122</b> through the gear box <b>117</b>. In one embodiment, actuator <b>122</b> is a threaded ball screw but may assume other configurations as well without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The lower end of the actuator <b>122</b> is pivotally mounted to a bracket <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) mounted to the base <b>12</b>. The foot pedal <b>118</b> is electrically coupled to a control box <b>119</b> located in the base cavity <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A nut <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is threaded to the ball screw actuator <b>122</b> so that the nut <b>126</b> and a block <b>124</b> mounted to the nut <b>126</b> are driven by the actuator <b>122</b> between raised and lowered positions. The block <b>124</b> has a pair of passageways <b>128</b> therethrough which are adapted to receive shafts <b>130</b> of the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> so that the block <b>124</b> is secured to the second set <b>100</b> of legs <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref> illustrate one of the slides <b>26</b> of the present invention. Each slide <b>26</b> has a web portion <b>142</b>, an upper flange portion <b>144</b> and a lower flange portion <b>146</b>. The upper and lower flange portions <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> each have an inside surface <b>144</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b</i>, respectively, which are parallel to one another. The web portion <b>142</b> has an inside surface <b>142</b><i>a</i>. The inside surfaces <b>144</b><i>a</i>, <b>146</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i>define a track <b>44</b> of the slide <b>26</b> inside which rides one of the non-rotatable bearings <b>30</b>. The slides <b>26</b> are preferably made of aluminum but may be made of any material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates one of the non-rotatable bearings <b>30</b>. Each of the bearings <b>30</b> has a circular recess <b>148</b> adapted to receive and retain one end of one of the shafts <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. Each bearing <b>30</b> has a rectangular outer portion <b>150</b> having outer surfaces <b>152</b>. The two opposed upper and lower outer surfaces <b>152</b> define a height distance which is approximately equal to the height distance between the inside surfaces <b>144</b>A and <b>146</b>A of the upper and lower flange portions <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of each slide <b>26</b>. Thus, each bearing <b>30</b> is able to travel inside the track <b>44</b> of the slide <b>26</b> in a non-rotatable manner, and the approximately equal height of the bearings <b>30</b> and the inside height of the tracks <b>44</b> creates a very tight clearance to accommodate the tension and compression forces exerted by the legs <b>102</b> and <b>110</b>. The bearings <b>30</b> are made of plastic, in particular, Polymer Blend <b>15</b>, a plastic commercially available from Performance Plastics, Incorporated, 435 Brownway Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45209.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation, when the foot pedal <b>118</b> is depressed to lower the examination table <b>10</b>, the motor <b>116</b> is actuated causing the actuator <b>122</b> to rotate. Thus, the nut <b>126</b> and block <b>124</b> are driven downwardly, causing the bearings <b>30</b> to ride rearwardly inside the slides <b>26</b> attached along the actuator <b>122</b> to the base <b>12</b> and upper frame <b>32</b>, and the upper frame <b>32</b> to move downwardly until it rests upon an upper surface <b>123</b> of the side members <b>19</b> of the base <b>12</b>. At this point, the upper frame <b>32</b> actuates switches <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) stopping the motor. As the examination table <b>10</b> is lowered, the actuator <b>122</b> and its associated drive motor <b>115</b> pivot downwardly about the pivotal connection of the actuator <b>122</b> to the bracket <b>133</b>. The actuator <b>122</b> and motor <b>115</b> rest within the internal cavity <b>18</b> of the base <b>12</b> when the examination table <b>10</b> is moved to the patient entry/exit position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref>. In its lowermost position, the patient support surface is located approximately eighteen (18) inches above the ground to provide a convenient and safe entry and exit position for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To raise the table assembly <b>14</b>, the foot pedal <b>118</b> is depressed to actuate the motor <b>115</b>. This causes the actuator <b>122</b> to rotate in the opposite direction, thereby moving the nut <b>126</b> and block <b>124</b> upwardly and causing the bearings <b>30</b> to move forwardly in the slides <b>26</b>. Eventually the nut <b>126</b> and block <b>124</b> will not go any higher on the actuator <b>122</b>, at which point the motor <b>115</b> is stopped. As the examination table is raised to a patient examination position, the actuator <b>122</b> and motor <b>115</b> pivot upwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In its uppermost position, the patient support surface is located approximately thirty-seven (37) inches above the ground to provide a convenient examination position of the patient for the physician.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the scissor-lift assembly <b>16</b> is covered by a shroud assembly <b>134</b>, comprising multiple shroud pieces <b>136</b>A-D, each being nestable inside the shroud piece directly above it. Although four shroud pieces are illustrated and described, any number of shroud pieces may be used in accordance with the present invention. Shroud piece <b>136</b><i>a </i>is fixedly secured to the base <b>12</b> and shroud piece <b>136</b><i>d </i>is fixedly secured to the upper frame <b>32</b>. The middle shroud pieces <b>136</b><i>b</i>, <b>136</b><i>c </i>float between the upper and lower shroud pieces <b>136</b><i>d </i>and <b>136</b><i>a</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the shroud pieces has at least one bearing strip <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), such as a VELCRO strip, which facilitates movement of the shroud pieces relative to one another. In addition, each of the shroud pieces <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>has joint <b>140</b>. The joints <b>140</b> of adjacent shroud pieces are offset relative to each other so as to not interfere with the movement and nestability of the shroud piece <b>136</b> and of the shroud assembly <b>134</b>.</p>
