<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cannula which is provided with a pair of nares which each have a primary aperture or opening formed in an end surface or wall thereof defining a primary flow path into and out of the nare for supplying a desired gas to a nostril of a patient, withdrawing or sampling a desired gas from a nostril of a patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril as the patient breathing, etc., and is further provided with at least one additional secondary opening(s), within at least one and preferably both of the nares, for providing a secondary flow passage into and out of the nare for supplying a desired gas to a nostril of a patient, withdrawing a desired gas from a nostril of a patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and airflow), or detecting changes in pressure as the patient breathing, etc., in the event that the primary breathing path becomes occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise either partially or fully obstructed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The practice of measuring end-tidal carbon dioxide during the administration of anesthesia, particularly regional anesthesia, has grown markedly in the past several years. The reasons that anaesthesiologists have embraced this technique are described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,656 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The preferred nasal cannula used in this procedure is a cannula which insufflates the patient with oxygen through one nare of a cannula and separately samples the exhaled gases by drawing the exhaled gas from the other nare into a conventional carbon dioxide analyzer. The cannula is preferably provided with an internal wall, a partition, a barrier or a system in the face piece to keep the conduits completely separate from one another for insufflation and sampling, however, separate lines can be used or even multiple nares for insufflation and sampling, though the latter device substantially increases the risk of gases mixing which can distort the readings for end-tidal carbon dioxide. It is preferred that two nares only are employed and that each nare performs only one function, i.e., insufflation or sampling into or from separate nostrils, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics, etc. Likewise, insufflation has normally been continuous, however, it could advantageously be intermittent which would further improve the end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement by insuring that gases being sampled where representative of exhaled gases undiluted by the other gases being insufflated. Most preferably, the intermittent insufflation is accomplished by the apparatus and method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,131 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other so-called demand insufflation devices which being insufflation upon the start of inhalation can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normal nasal cannulae are designed with the nares having a slight inward curvature as the nares extend upward from the face piece. This is anatomically desirable and important for imparting the proper direction of the insufflating gas into the nasal cavities, receiving the sampled gas(es) from the patient, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics of the patient, etc. When the patient is in the upright sitting position or ambulatory, this is the most satisfactory design configuration. Conversely, problems can be encountered if the patient is horizontal or prone and tends to accumulate secretions in the nasal cavities. It can be a particularly vexing problem if either the insufflation or sampling nare becomes occluded during the use of the cannula for sampling, monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide during the administration of anesthesia, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics of a patient, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem which can readily occur during use of a cannular positioned in the nostrils of a patient is that the primary opening, formed in the remote end wall or surface, of one or both of the nares may become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions and/or soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula. This is particularly true if the nasal cannula is used in a patient for an extended period of time, e.g., for a few hours to eight or more hours during a sleep diagnostic session. Over the course of time, the mucosal secretions and/or soft mucosal tissue, as well as any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, can either partially or completely occlude, block, clog or otherwise obstruct the primary inlet/outlet opening to one or both nares and such occlusion, blockage, or obstruction can then prevent that nare from properly achieving its intended function, e.g., prevent or seriously inhibit the nare from properly supplying the desired gas to the nostril of the patient, withdrawing or sampling the desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detecting changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a nasal cannula structure for sampling carbon dioxide which reduces or eliminates the incidence of occlusion of the tip of the carbon dioxide sampling nare during the removal of carbon dioxide by the sampling line connected to a monitoring device and/or a source of suction or vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a nasal cannula for insufflating a patient with oxygen while accurately monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide, that will continue to function properly for its intended purpose when either or both nares become occluded for any reason.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object to accomplish the foregoing objects with a minimum risk of distorting the end-tidal carbon dioxide readings from the sampled exhalation gases during the administration of anesthesia.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another object of the present invention is to provide at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed openings, in a side wall of the nare, which form a secondary flow path into and out of the nare and insures proper function of the nare in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc. That is, the secondary flow path insures that the nare is still able to function properly, e.g., supply a desired gas to the nostril of the patient or withdraw or sample a desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detect changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc., in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide both of the nares with at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed openings, in a side walls thereof which form secondary flow paths for each nare and insures proper function of each nare in the event that the primary flow path of that nare becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide the nasal cannula with at least one mouthpiece, and possibly a pair of joined or completely separate mouthpieces, for communicating with a mouth of a patient so that the breathing characteristics (such as respiratory air waves and air flow) may be monitored during a sleep diagnostic session regardless of whether the patient solely breathes through his or her nose, the patient solely breathes through his or her mouth, or alternate breathing between his or her nose and mouth during the sleep diagnostic session. The mouthpiece has an internal fluid passageway which communicates, at one end thereof, with an inlet/outlet aperture or opening formed in end surface of the mouthpiece while an opposite end thereof communicates with an internal chamber or compartment of the nasal cannula.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing objects and advantages are obtained by providing a nasal cannula structure that is adapted for insufflation and sampling, with additional or secondary holes or vents on or in the nares of the nasal cannula, preferably both anterior and posterior of one or both nares at the location proximate the entrance of the nasal passageways when the cannula is in use for supplying the desired gas to the nostril of the patient or withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), or monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and air flow), or detecting changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to a nasal cannula for coupling to flow/pressure detection equipment to facilitate collection of respiratory air waves and respiratory air flow of a patient, during a sleep diagnostic session, for inputting to conventional polysomnography equipment and subsequent analysis by sleep lab personnel. The collected data is useful in treating a patient for sleep apnea or a number of other different sleep disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also relates to a method of monitoring breathing of a patient with a nasal cannula, the method comprising the steps of: forming the nasal cannula with at least one nare, and the at least one nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening formed in a remote end thereof; coupling the nasal cannula to a detection device for monitoring breathing characteristics of the patient while the patient is sleeping; detecting breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient is sleeping, via at least the primary inlet/outlet opening of the nare; and sending the detected breathing characteristics of the patient to detection device for evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention also relates to A nasal cannula for monitoring breathing of a patient, the nasal cannula comprising an elongated hollow body for positioning adjacent a nose of the patient; a first nare having a fixed length, a remote free first end of the first nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening therein and being sized to be received within a first nasal passage of the nose, a second end of the first nare being connected to an internal compartment, and the first nare has at least one secondary inlet/outlet opening which communicates with the internal compartment; a second nare having a fixed length, a remote free first end of the second nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening therein and being sized to be received within a second nasal passage of the nose, a second end of the second nare being connected to an internal compartment, and the second nare has at least one secondary inlet/outlet opening which communicates with the internal compartment; and coupling the nasal cannula to a detection device for monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient while the patient is sleeping; detecting breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient is sleeping, via at least the primary inlet/outlet opening of at least one of the first and second nares; and detecting the breathing characteristics of the patient, via at least the second inlet/outlet opening of at least one of the first and second nares, in the event that the primary inlet/outlet opening of one of the first and second nare becomes at least partially occluded.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The nasal cannula <b>10</b> of one embodiment of the present invention comprises or consists of a generally tubular face piece <b>12</b> having two spaced apart nares <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> and an internal septum <b>15</b> disposed in the center of the face piece <b>12</b> between the flow passage openings <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, respectively, of the nares <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>). The flow passage openings <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> on the ends of the face piece <b>12</b> are affixed to separate conduits or tubes <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which are separately connected to a source of insufflating gas (G), such as oxygen, and a commercial carbon dioxide monitoring unit (A) which, in turn, has or is connected to a vacuum pump or other means for drawing an exhaled breath, containing carbon dioxide, into an instrument that is capable of measuring the concentration of the carbon dioxide in the sampled gas.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During use of the cannula for both insufflation and the monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration in the exhaled breath (depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the readings for end-tidal carbon dioxide can become distorted when there is undesirable mixing with room air or with excess insufflating gas. Likewise, carbon dioxide measuring devices which typically employ varying amounts of suction or vacuum to obtain the gas sample to be analyzed, can unduly dilute the sample or more seriously can draw the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b>, located in the tip <b>30</b> of the sampling nare (representatively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), into contact with the adjacent surface of the tissue of the nasal passage and either partially or fully occlude the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b> thereby restricting or even preventing sampling of the exhaled gases for their carbon dioxide concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This is an especially serious problem where the patient is prone to generate secretions and the secretions are present so as to be drawn into the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b> at the tip <b>30</b> and then either partially or fully occlude, block, clog or otherwise obstruct the opening <b>31</b>, during the administration of anesthesia or a sleep diagnostic session, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The anesthesiologist must respond by clearing the nare opening after first removing the cannula from its initially installed location on the face of the patient. This may be complicated especially where the patient is draped in a manner which covers the cannula, such as in eye surgery. It may also be difficult to detect the occlusion where the end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement signal is only partially, but not fully, degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It has been discovered that the expedient of additionally providing the nares with very small holes or openings, shown collectively at <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> adjacent the tip <b>30</b>, achieves the desired result of preventing an undesirable and unnecessary level of suction at the opening <b>31</b> of the tip <b>30</b> from developing sufficiently to draw the opening <b>31</b> into the nasal tissue thereby either partially or fully occluding, blocking, clogging or otherwise obstructing the opening <b>31</b>. The holes are sized large enough to prevent sufficient suction from developing at the tip <b>30</b> so as to draw in mucosal secretions or attach the tip by suction to the soft mucosal tissue, while still facilitating drawing an undiluted sample of the exhaled gases to provide good end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements. Likewise, too large an opening for these holes would undesirably dilute the exhaled gas sample with room air or excess insufflation gas.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and/or <b>38</b> also facilitate obtaining or withdrawing a desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detect changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc., by providing a secondary flow path in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously noted, the nasal cannula of the present invention can be used in combination with an oxygen delivery system that delivers the insufflating gas intermittently. The delivery can be initiated at any time after the peak end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement is achieved during exhalation and continuing into the inhalation phase of the breathing cycle or could be inhalation activated or designed to deliver only during selected portions of all or only some of the inhalation phases of a patient's breathing cycles. Preferably, the delivery should begin before the termination of the exhalation phase, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,131. Using intermittent delivery substantially reduces the possibility of distorted carbon dioxide readings due to gas mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Likewise, slits or slots (not shown) may be employed in the nares which could function in the same manner as the holes describe if they are positioned in such a manner to avoid collapse or occlusion with the nasal tissues and provide the desired function of preventing sufficient suction from developing at the tip of the nare to cause it to be drawn, by suction, onto the tissues. The holes provided as described herein are preferred as there is less risk of occlusion and trauma from the edges of slits or slots to the nasal tissue and potentially there is less risk of occlusion and trauma from the edges of slits or slots to the nasal tissue and potentially there is less risk of gas dilution and mixing from occurring where the slits or slots are overly large.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the combination of intermittent insufflation using the cannula of the present invention produces the desired end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement, as described, and helps prevent patient desaturation during the rigors of surgery and anesthesia administration.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the size of the openings from between about 0.05 to about 0.07 of an inch or so though larger or smaller holes or a single hole may be advantageously employed in combination with specific analytical apparatuses. The size and location of the openings can vary with the analyzer selected and the proper function confirmed without undue experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is to be appreciated that as discussed above, the cannula may have only a single hollow nasal prong or nare, a pair of nasal prongs or nares and the cannula can be divided or undivided. In addition, the spacing from the nare will vary depending upon whether the cannula is used for neonatal, pediatric or an adult. In addition, the spacing of the mouthpieces, if more than one mouthpiece is utilized, can vary from application from application. The important aspect of the present invention is that the secondary inlet/outlet openings are provided in the nare to allow the nare to function even if the primary inlet/outlet becomes substantially blocked, clogged, obstructed or occluded for one reason or another. The secondary holes allow the nare to still operate and preform the intended function. That is, the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) still allow the nare to supply a treating gas to the nostril of the patient, allow sampling or withdrawal of an exit gas being exhausted by the nostril of the patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), allow monitoring or detection of the breathing characteristic via the nare, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inventors of the present invention have found that the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s), provided in at least one of the nares, is very useful in monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (e.g., detecting changes in pressure during breathing), to sleep lab personnel, in the event that one or both of the primary inlet/outlet openings of the nares becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inventors have determined that the primary inlet/outlet opening in combination with the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) ensure the ability of the nare to adequately detect or sense the change in pressure within the nasal cavity of the patient, wearing the nasal cannula, as the patient breathes while he or she is sleeping and being monitored. In addition, the secondary inlet/outlet opening is still able to adequately detect or sense the change in pressure within the nasal cavity of the patient, wearing the nasal cannula, as the patient breathes while he or she is sleeping and being monitored. That is, the secondary inlet/outlet opening is still able to detect changes in pressure, e.g., from negative to positive and vice versa, as the patient discontinues inhalation (negative pressure) and commences exhalation (positive pressure), and vice versa, withdraw or sample a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), etc. As a result of this, the sleep diagnostic equipment is still able to continue monitoring the breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient remains sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the nasal cannula were unable to continue to monitor breathing characteristics of the patient, detect pressure, sample a desired gas, etc., the sleep lab technician will generally alter or manipulate the position of the nasal cannula in an attempt to remove or alleviate the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction, while the patient is still sleeping, without waking or arousing the patient. In some instances, the sleep lab technician may have to completely remove the nasal cannula, clear the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction, and then reinstall the nasal cannula while the patient is still sleeping, without waking the patient. However, if the patient wakes up during such manipulation or removal by the sleep lab technician, this will delay somewhat the sleep lab test or may possibly cause the sleep lab technician to restart patient testing and this can be costly and time consuming. It is to be appreciated that without the additional secondary inlet/outlet opening, provided in a side wall of the nare, in many instances the patient may be sufficiently aroused or awakened, as the sleep lab technician attempts to manipulate or remove the cannula to remove or alleviate the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of the cannula will now be discussed. As this embodiment is very similar to the previous embodiment, identical reference numerals will given to identical elements and only the differences between this embodiment and the previous embodiment will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The only significant difference between this embodiment and the previous embodiment is the addition of a curved mouthpiece which is connected to the main body of the cannula for monitoring the breathing characteristics of a patient, obtaining a desired sample, detecting pressure, for example, for a mouth breathing patient. That is, the nasal cannula <b>60</b> comprises a single flow path having three separate inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> to the central internal chamber or compartment C defined by the main body. Each one of the three inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> to the central internal chamber or compartment C is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient, etc., both via either a nostril or the mouth of a patient. The central chamber or compartment C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b> is in constant and continuous communication with an inlet/outlet opening <b>83</b>, formed in the end surface of the mouthpiece <b>69</b>, via a gas passageway <b>77</b> in the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>62</b>, formed in the end surface of the first nare <b>65</b>, and the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) <b>35</b> and/or <b>36</b> via a gas passageway <b>91</b> in the first nare <b>65</b> and in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>64</b>, formed in the end surface of the second nare <b>67</b>, and the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) <b>37</b> and/or <b>38</b> via a gas passageway <b>95</b> in the second nare <b>67</b>. In addition, the central chamber or compartment C of the main body <b>71</b> also communicates with first and second opposed chamber end openings <b>73</b>, <b>75</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>. As a result of this arrangement, each one of these inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> can facilitate preforming one of the following functions: monitor breathing of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, sampling the end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the exhaled breath of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose to determine the patient's CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration level in the blood, measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, detecting changes in pressure air flow, or detecting apnea via the mouth and/or the nose, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A first conduit or tubing <b>74</b> is connected to the first end chamber opening <b>73</b> while a first end of a second conduit or tubing <b>76</b> is connected to a second chamber end opening <b>75</b>. The opposed second ends of the first and second conduits or tubings <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are connected to a coupling device <b>78</b> which couples the first and second conduits or tubings <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> to a common conduit or tubing <b>80</b> which is also connected to the coupling device <b>78</b>. The opposite end of the common conduit or tubing <b>80</b> typically has a luer connector <b>82</b> which is either coupled to a filter <b>84</b>, prior to engaging with a pressure detection device or detection equipment <b>86</b> or, preferably, the filter <b>84</b> may be incorporated into the conventional luer connector <b>82</b> and this unitary structure will then facilitate coupling of the nasal cannula <b>60</b> to the pressure detection device or detection equipment <b>86</b> in a conventional fashion. The first and second conduits or tubings <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> each have a length of about 8 inches to about a 24 inches or so and preferably have a length of about 15 to 25 inches or so while the common conduit or tubing <b>80</b> typically has a length of about 3 feet to about 10 feet, preferably a length of about 5 to 7 feet or so.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The only significant differences between this embodiment and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the inclusion of a second integral mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032; and the addition of an internal divider or septum <b>81</b>, within the internal chamber or compartment C, which divides the internal area of the cannula into two separate chambers or compartments C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. That is, the nasal cannula <b>60</b> comprises two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. Each one of the two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient, etc., both via a nostril and the mouth of a patient. The first compartment or passageway C<b>1</b>, of the internal chamber C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>, is in constant and continuous communication with an inlet/outlet opening <b>83</b>, formed in the end surface of the first mouthpiece <b>69</b>, via a gas passageway <b>77</b> in the first mouthpiece <b>69</b> and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>62</b>, formed in the end surface of the first nare <b>65</b>, via a gas passageway <b>91</b> in the first nare <b>65</b> and with the first chamber end opening <b>73</b> of the cannula and all of these components and passageways form the first completely separate internal flow path <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The second compartment or passageway C<b>2</b>, of the internal chamber C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>, is in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>87</b>, formed in the end surface of the second mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032;, via a gas passageway <b>79</b> in the second mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032; and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>64</b>, formed in the end surface of the second nare <b>67</b>, via a gas passageway <b>95</b> in the second nare <b>67</b> and with the second chamber end opening <b>75</b> of the cannula <b>60</b> and all of these components and passageways form the second completely separate internal flow path <b>98</b>. As a result of these completely separate fluid passageways <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, each completely separate fluid passageway <b>96</b> or <b>98</b> can facilitate preforming one of the following functions: monitor breathing of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, sampling the end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the exhaled breath of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose to determine the patient's CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration level in the blood, measuring differential air flow along the tubing connected to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, detecting apnea via the mouth and/or the nose, etc. If desired, the septum <b>81</b> may be eliminated (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) so that the first and second compartments or passageways C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, the first and second internal gas passageways <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> and the first and second gas passageways <b>91</b> and <b>95</b> in the nares <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> and all of the openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>87</b>, are in constant and continuous communication with one another.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The only significant difference between this embodiment and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is the inclusion of at least one, and preferably a pair of secondary inlets/outlets openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, adjacent the tip of each one of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> to provide a pair of secondary flow passages <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> in the event that the primary inlets/outlets openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b>, respectively, become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the nasal cannula <b>60</b>. The secondary inlets/outlets openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> are smaller than the primary inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> but are large enough to facilitate withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling of end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril, etc., during patient breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, yet another embodiment of the cannula will now be discussed. As this embodiment is very similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, identical reference numerals are given to identical elements and only the differences between this embodiment and the previous embodiment will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The only significant difference between this embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is that the septum <b>81</b> is eliminated so that the first and second compartments or passageways C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, the first and second internal gas passageways <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> and the first and second gas passageways <b>91</b> and <b>95</b> in the nares <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> and all of the openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>87</b> are in constant and continuous communication with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, it is to be appreciated that it is not necessary to have the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; precisely centered between the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b>. It is possible to position the first and second mouthpieces on one side or the other of a central plane P bisecting a center of main body <b>71</b> into two halves. Alternatively, the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; could be spaced apart from one another and formed as two completely separate and curved mouthpieces (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>) with a septum <b>81</b> dividing the internal chamber or compartment into two separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>). Each one of the two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), supplying a desired gas to the patient, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the first and second mouthpieces could be spaced apart from one another, without having a dividing septum <b>81</b> therebetween (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), so that both of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> and both of the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; all communicate with one another via the common central chamber or compartment formed within the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>. The spacing of the mouthpieces from one another by a distance of from about 0.25 to about 1.25 inches, and more preferably about 0.5 to about 1.0 inches, is useful if the patient being monitored tends to breath, when mouth breathing, out of one side of his or her mouth. By spacing the mouthpieces from one another, mouthpieces of the nasal cannula are better positioned to still detect or monitor breathing of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, the first and second nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> may be each provided with at least one, and preferably a pair of secondary inlets/outlets openings, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, adjacent the tip <b>30</b> of the nares to provide a pair of secondary flow passages <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, respectively) in the event that the primary inlets/outlets openings <b>31</b> of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the nasal cannula. The secondary inlets/outlets openings, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> are smaller than the primary inlet/outlet opening but are large enough to facilitate withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling of end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril, etc., during patient breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If desired, one or both of the mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; of the cannula <b>60</b> can be provided with a shape retaining, dead soft material or wire (not shown) to facilitate alignment and retention of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; in a desired aligned position during use of the cannula <b>60</b>. The wire permits the mouthpiece <b>69</b> or <b>69</b>&#x2032; to be bent, configured or molded into a desired shape, configuration or position while still retaining such desired shape, configuration or position following adjustment of the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;. A copper wire (either insulated or uninsulated), for example, has substantially no structural memory of any previous shape, orientation, configuration or form which would cause the wire to retain, return or spring back to such previous shape, orientation, configuration or form. Copper is a highly malleable metal and generally retains whatever shape is imparted thereto at any particular time without reverting or returning back to any prior or previous shape. Copper is also a preferred dead soft material, over for example iron, steel or other ferromagnetic materials, due to the propensity of the nasal cannula to be used in connection with a patient exposed to certain electromagnetic and magnetic environments and/or diagnosis procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The wire can either be formed integral with the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032;, can be accommodated within an integral compartment extending along the length of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;, or can be glued or otherwise permanently secured or affixed to an exterior surface of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;, along the entire length thereof, so that the wire does not become separated or dislodged from the cannula during use of the nasal cannula. The wire typically has a diameter of between 0.01 and 0.2 inches or so.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; each have a radius of curvature of between about 0.5 of an inch to about 2.5 inches or so, and more preferably a radius of curvature of between about 0.75 of an inch to about 1.25 inches or so. The radius of curvature of the mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; can vary, depending upon the cannula being manufactured and/or its application, but is generally chosen to facilitate the alignment of an opening formed in the free end of the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032; with the opening of a mouth of the patient. The first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; each define an internal passageway <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> therein which has a transverse cross sectional flow area of between about 0.006 and about 0.007 square inches.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since certain changes may be made in the above described improved cannula and method of using the same, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the invention. That is, the invention described herein is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims and the applicable prior art.</p>
