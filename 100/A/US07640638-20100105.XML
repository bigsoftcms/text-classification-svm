<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a fastening system for a wearing article and particularly to such a fastening system for a disposable diaper.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are well known fastening systems for connect front and rear waist regions of a wearing article by means of a mechanical fastener comprising a hook component and a loop component detachably engageable with the hook component. For example, National Publication of translated version No. 2002-532147 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Reference 1&#x201d;) discloses a diaper adapted to be fastened around a diaper wearer's body by means of the mechanical fasteners respectively provided on transversely opposite side edges of the diaper. The diaper disclosed therein adopts the fastening system having the hook component <b>107</b> provided on an outer side of the diaper as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> in the accompanying drawing of the present specification, taking account of a possibility that it might create a feeling of discomfort against the wearer if the hook component <b>107</b> come in contact with the wearer's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, even in the case of such a fastening system having the hook element <b>107</b> protruding outward with respect to the wearer's body, it is likely that the hook component <b>107</b> might be curled as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> and irritate the wearer' skin if a force F functioning to disengage the hook component <b>107</b> from the loop component is exerted on a free end <b>113</b> of a attachment sheet <b>120</b> carrying the hook component <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 1997-191908 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Reference 2&#x201d;) discloses a fastening system having a construction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, wherein the hook component <b>107</b> is bonded to the attachment sheet <b>120</b> through the intermediary of a base sheet <b>105</b> which is, in turn, provided on its rear surface with a joining area <b>114</b> and a non-joining area <b>115</b> to the diaper, and the non-joining area <b>115</b> is located aside toward the free end <b>11</b> of the hook component <b>107</b>. With this fastening system, it is unlikely that the hook component <b>107</b> might be easily disengaged from the loop component <b>108</b> even if the hook component <b>107</b> is moved so as to be vertically spaced from the loop component <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of the fastening system disclosed in Reference 2, the base sheet <b>105</b> is provided on its rear side with the joining area <b>114</b> and the non-joining area <b>115</b> to the attachment sheet <b>120</b>. Such an arrangement certainly ensure that a section of the attachment sheet <b>120</b> extending from a border <b>127</b> between the joining area <b>114</b> and the non-joining area <b>115</b> to the free end <b>113</b> is deformed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, in response to the force F oriented to disengage the hook component <b>107</b> from the loop component <b>108</b> and thereby the hook component <b>107</b> is protected from being easily curled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the fastening system disclosed in Reference 2, however, should an engagement strength between the hook component <b>107</b> and the loop component <b>108</b> is higher than tear strength of the base sheet <b>105</b>, it is likely that the hook component <b>107</b> could not be disengaged from the loop component <b>108</b> in the non-joining area <b>115</b> and, as a result, the base sheet <b>105</b> might be torn apart along the border <b>127</b> between the joining area <b>114</b> and the non-joining area <b>115</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a fastening system for a wearing article provided with a hook component and a loop component so improved that the hook component can be protected from being easily curled and the base sheet is protected from being torn as the hook component is disengaged from the loop component.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a fastening system for a wearing article comprising: a first waist region corresponding to one of front and rear waist regions and having transversely opposed first side edge portions; a second waist region corresponding to the other of the front and rear waist regions and having transversely opposite second side edge portions; a crotch region extending between said first and second waist regions; hook carrying side edge portions provided along the transversely opposite first side edge portions and having respective hook components secured thereto; and loop carrying side edge portions provided along the transversely opposite second side edge portions and having respective loop components secured thereto which are detachably engageable with the respective hook components.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention further comprises each of the hook carrying side edge portions comprising a first sheet section extending outward from each of the first side edges, a second sheet section being contiguous to an outer side edge of the first sheet section and extending toward each of the transverse side edges, a joining area extending in parallel to and spaced from the outer side edge so as to join the first sheet section to the second sheet section, and a non-joining area surrounded by the joining area, the first and second sheet sections and the outer side edge; and each of the hook components has first and second side edges extending in parallel to the outer side edge and is secured to one of the first sheet section and the second sheet section in such a manner that the first side edge lies in the joining area while the second side edge lies in the non-joining area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the first sheet section and the second sheet section are formed from a unitary sheet element and the unitary sheet element is folded back along the outer side edge to form each of the hook carrying side edge portions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one of the first sheet section and the second sheet section is formed in the non-joining area with at least one slit including a directional component which is parallel to the outer edge.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to still another preferred embodiment of the invention, the hook component comprises a base sheet made of thermoplastic resin and a plurality of hook elements protruding from a top surface of the base sheet, the first and second sheet sections are formed from a nonwoven fabric containing thermoplastic resin fibers, both the base sheet and the nonwoven fabric have a tear strength being relatively low in one direction and relatively high in a direction orthogonal to the one direction, and the hook component is secured to one of the first and second sheet section in such a manner that the one direction in which the base sheet exhibits a relatively low tear strength does not coincide with the one direction in which the nonwoven fabric exhibits a relatively low tear strength.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to further another preferred embodiment of the invention, a reinforcing sheet is secured to the base sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, the base sheet for the hook component is secured to one of the first and second sheet sections and thereby reinforced by a nonwoven fabric constituting the first and second sheet sections.

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the first and second sheet sections cooperating with the outer side edge to surround the non-joining area are further entrained during deformation due to the force oriented to disengage the hook component from the loop component, such force functioning to disengage the hook component from the loop component is divided into the force component oriented toward the second side edge of the hook component and the force component oriented toward the border between the non-joining area and the joining area. Consequentially, the force functioning for disengagement of the hook component is correspondingly weakened and the hook component is protected against being easily curled.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Details of a fastening system <b>1</b> for the wearing article according to the present invention will be more fully understood from the description given hereunder exemplarily with respect to the case of a diaper <b>10</b> with reference to the accompanying drawings. The diaper <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a perspective view comprises a longitudinal direction Y, a transverse direction X, a waist surrounding direction Z, a liquid-permeable body side liner <b>10</b>A defining a body side surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>, a liquid-impermeable outer sheet <b>10</b>B defining a garment side surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>and a liquid-absorbent core (not shown) interposed the body side liner <b>10</b>A and the outer sheet <b>10</b>B, and further comprises a front waist region <b>2</b>, a rear waist region <b>3</b> and a crotch region <b>4</b> extending between these two regions <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. Waist surrounding elastic elements <b>42</b> are attached under tension along a waist hole defining edges <b>41</b> of the front and rear waist regions <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> while leg surrounding elastic elements <b>44</b> are attached under tension along a pair of leg hole defining edges <b>43</b>. In addition, the front and rear waist regions <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are provided with auxiliary elastic elements <b>45</b> attached under tension thereto so as to extend circumferentially and to provide a good fit of the diaper <b>10</b> to the wearer's body.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fastening system <b>1</b> for the diaper <b>10</b> comprises hook carrying side edge portions <b>17</b> provided along the transversely opposite side edge portions <b>21</b> of the front waist region <b>2</b> to which respective hook components <b>7</b> are permanently bonded and loop carrying side edge portions <b>18</b> provided along the transversely opposite side edge portions <b>31</b> to which respective loop components <b>8</b> are permanently bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be appreciated, both the hook component <b>7</b> and the loop component <b>8</b> constitute a so-called mechanical fastener adapted to be detachably engaged with each other. When the diaper <b>10</b> is put on the wearer's body, the loop carrying side edge portions <b>18</b> may be pressed against the associated hook carrying side edge portions <b>18</b>. When the diaper <b>10</b> is taken off from the wearer's body, for example, the upper ends <b>25</b> of the loop carrying side edge portions <b>18</b> including the loop components <b>8</b> may be gripped by the wearer's fingers and then the loop components <b>8</b> may be sequentially disengaged from the hook component <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the hook carrying side edge portions <b>17</b> is formed of a unitary sheet element <b>20</b> extending outward from the associated one of the transversely opposite side edge portions <b>21</b> of the front waist region, then folded back onto the side edge <b>21</b> along a line extending in parallel to the side edge <b>21</b> so as to define an outer side edge <b>13</b> of this hook carrying side edge portions <b>17</b> and provided with the hook component <b>7</b> so as to protrude outward with respect to the diaper wearer's body.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A section of the sheet element <b>20</b> extending from the side edge <b>21</b> of the front waist region <b>2</b> to the outer side edge <b>13</b> is referred to herein as a first sheet section <b>11</b> and the remaining section of the sheet element <b>20</b> extending from the outer side edge <b>13</b> back to the side edge <b>21</b> is referred to herein as a second sheet section <b>12</b>. It should be understood that the sheet element <b>20</b> preferably comprises a fibrous nonwoven fabric containing thermoplastic resin fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first and second sheet sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are joined together in a joining area <b>14</b> extending in parallel to and spaced apart from the outer side edge <b>13</b> by means of hot melt adhesive HM but free from each other in a non-joining area <b>15</b> surrounded by the first and second sheet sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the outer side edge <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The hook component <b>7</b> comprises a base sheet <b>5</b> made of thermoplastic resin and a plurality of hook elements <b>6</b> protruding from a top surface of the base sheet <b>5</b>. The base sheet <b>5</b> has a first side edge <b>16</b> extending in parallel to the associated one of the transversely opposite side edge portions <b>21</b> of the front waist region and a second side edge <b>19</b> opposed to the first side edge <b>16</b>. The base sheet <b>5</b> is permanently bonded to the first sheet section <b>11</b> by means of hot melt adhesive HM so that the first side edge <b>16</b> may overlie the joining area while the second side edge <b>19</b> may overlie the non-joining area <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With such an arrangement, hot melt adhesive HM cooperates with the nonwoven fabric constituting the first sheet section <b>11</b> to reinforce the base sheet <b>5</b> and thereby to eliminate the possibility that the hook component <b>7</b> might be torn apart when the loop component <b>8</b> is disengaged from the hook component <b>7</b>. To achieve this, the nonwoven fabric preferably has a tear strength higher than a tear strength of the hook component <b>7</b>. The possibility that the hook component <b>7</b> might be torn apart can be more reliably eliminated by bonding a reinforcing sheet (not shown) such as a nonwoven fabric or plastic film to the base sheet <b>5</b> prior to permanently bonding the base sheet <b>5</b> to the first sheet section <b>11</b> constituting the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b>. Hot melt adhesive HM is preferably applied substantially over the whole area of the base sheet <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, the base sheet <b>5</b> made of a thermoplastic resin exhibits a relatively low tear strength in the direction of extrusion for sheet forming. Specifically, if the thermoplastic resin is extruded in the direction parallel to the direction in which the side edge <b>21</b> of the waist region extend (i.e., the direction in which the loop carrying side edge portion extends from its upper end <b>25</b> to its lower end <b>26</b>), the base sheet <b>5</b> would be disadvantageously apt to be torn apart when the loop component <b>8</b> is disengaged from the hook component <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sheet element <b>20</b> made of a nonwoven fabric also may exhibits a relatively low tear strength in the direction of extrusion for sheet forming. In such case, it is essential to avoid such a relationship that the direction in which the base sheet <b>5</b> exhibits the lower tear strength coincides with the direction in which the sheet element <b>20</b> exhibits the lower tear strength in order to enhance a desired reinforcing effect of the sheet element <b>20</b> for the base sheet <b>5</b> and thereby to protect the base sheet <b>5</b> further reliably from being easily torn apart.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The hook component <b>7</b> has a tear strength preferably in a range of 0.3 to 3.0 N, more preferably in a range of 0.5 to 1.2 N. If the tear strength of the hook component <b>7</b> is less than 0.3 N, it will be impossible to assure a level of the tear strength required for the hook component <b>7</b> to be manufactured and practically used without any anxiety. If the tear strength of the hook member <b>7</b> exceeds 3.0 N, the base sheet <b>5</b> of the hook component <b>7</b> will become undesirably stiff and increase a feeling of discomfort during use of the diaper. The nonwoven fabric constituting the sheet member <b>20</b> has a tear strength preferably in a range of 3.5 to 25 N, more preferably in a range of 5.0 to 17 N. If the tear strength is less than 3.5 N, it will be impossible to assure a level of the tear strength required for the sheet element <b>20</b> to serve as the reinforcing material. If the tear strength exceeds 25 N, the nonwoven fabric constituting the sheet element <b>20</b> will become undesirably stiff and increase a feeling of discomfort during use of the diaper.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The tear strength is measured in a manner as follows: Assuming that the direction in which the base sheet <b>5</b> or the nonwoven fabric of the hook carrying side edge portion <b>7</b> to be tested was sheet-formed corresponds to its longitudinal direction and the direction orthogonal to this corresponds to its transverse direction, a sample of the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b> having a length of 50 mm and a width of 30 mm is prepared. Then a cutter is used to form the sample with a slit having a length of 20 mm long in the longitudinal direction from a point on one end of the sample bisecting the width of this sample. Along the slit, the sample is bifurcated and respective finger-grip margins of approximately 15 mm are attached to a tensile tester with an inter-chuck distance of 10 mm. Then the respective finger-grip margins are pulled in opposite directions at a pulling rate of 300 mm/min and a value of the maximum load measured until the sample is broken is determined as the tear strength of this sample.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the arrangement in which hook elements of the hook components <b>7</b> of the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b> protrude outward with respect to the wearer may cause a problem since the outer side edge <b>13</b> of the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b> is present inside the diaper <b>10</b> and apt to come in contact with the wearer's skin. Consequentially, if the wearer twists his or her body or inserts his or her fingers between the diaper <b>10</b> and his or her body and slidably moves these fingers circumferentially along his or her waistline, a force oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b> may be exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the fastening system <b>1</b> according to the present invention, even if a force oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b> is exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b>, a possibility that the hook component <b>7</b> might be partially or wholly disengaged from the loop component <b>8</b> can be effectively avoided as will be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a state before the force F oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b> is exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating states under such force F exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a portion of the sheet element <b>20</b> extending from the outer side edge <b>13</b> to the second side edge <b>19</b> of the base sheet <b>5</b> as well as a portion of the sheet element <b>20</b> extending from the outer side edge <b>13</b> to a border <b>27</b> between the non-joining area <b>15</b> and the joining area <b>14</b> is not joined to the other elements, i.e., free. Consequentially, these portions are deformable under an external force. These deformable portions will be collectively referred to hereinafter as a deformable area <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the wearer's movement causes the force F oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b> is exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b>, the latter is pushed by the force F and the deformable area <b>30</b> begins to be deformed since the outer side edge <b>13</b> extends outward beyond the second side edge <b>19</b> of the base sheet <b>5</b> constituting the hook component <b>7</b> as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Thus, the deformable area <b>30</b> is deformed so as to cover the second side edge <b>19</b> of the base sheet <b>5</b> constituting the hook component <b>7</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. If the force F continues to be exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b>, the deformable area <b>30</b> of the sheet element <b>20</b> will be displaced but remain to cover the second side edge <b>19</b> and thereby prevent the hook component <b>7</b> from being easily curled or disengaged from the loop component <b>8</b>. At this time point, the force F is oriented also to press the hook component <b>7</b> against the loop component <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The deformable area <b>30</b> is deformed under an entraining effect of the force F oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b> until the deformable area <b>30</b> takes a position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Thereupon, the force F is divided into a component f<b>1</b> oriented toward the second side edge <b>19</b> of the hook component <b>7</b> and a component f<b>2</b> oriented toward the border <b>27</b> between the non-joining area <b>15</b> and the joining area <b>14</b>. This means that the force exerted on the outer side edge <b>13</b> is reduced and the possibility of curling as well as disengagement of the hook component <b>7</b> can be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an alternative embodiment of the fastening system <b>1</b>. According to this alternative embodiment, the first sheet section <b>11</b> of the sheet element <b>20</b> on which the hook components <b>7</b> are permanently planted is formed with a plurality of slits <b>22</b> each extending obliquely with respect to the outer side edge <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to this embodiment, the area of the first sheet section <b>11</b> in which the slits <b>22</b> are formed is stretched as the deformable area <b>30</b> is entrained and deformed under the force F oriented to disengage the hook component <b>7</b> from the loop component <b>8</b>. As a result, the component of the force oriented toward the second side edge <b>19</b> of the hook component <b>7</b> is sufficiently reduced to protect the hook component <b>7</b> against being easily curled or disengaged from the loop component <b>8</b>. The elastic components such as the waist-surrounding elastic elements <b>42</b> and the auxiliary elastic elements <b>45</b> are processed preferably in such a manner that no elasticity should be expressed by these elastic elements immediately under the loop component <b>8</b>. This can be achieved by cutting, coating with a hot melt adhesive or chemical treatment of these elastic elements such as the auxiliary elastic elements <b>45</b> lying immediately under the loop component <b>8</b>. In this way, the anxiety that the loop component <b>8</b> might get wrinkles and a bond strength between the loop component <b>8</b> and the hook component <b>7</b> might be deteriorated can be reliably eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the fastening system according to the present invention has been described above on the basis of the preferred embodiments thereof, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments but may be exploited in the other various manners. For example, it is possible without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention to arrange hook elements of the hook component <b>7</b> so as to protrude not outward but inward. With this arrangement, it is unlikely that the hook component <b>7</b>, if curled, might damage the wearer's garment or bedclothes.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is also possible without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention to form the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b> from a pair of sheets instead of the unitary sheet element. In this case, these two sheets may be bonded to each other along edges thereof destined to define the outer side edge <b>13</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the illustrated embodiment having the hook carrying side edge portion <b>17</b> formed of the unitary sheet element is preferred to the alternative embodiment as has been described just above since the deformable area <b>30</b> including none of joined portions is smoothly deformable. In addition, bonding of the first and second sheet sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> as well as permanent bonding or planting of the hook component <b>7</b> may be carried out not only by means of hot melt adhesive HM but also by means of the other well known technique such as heat sealing or ultrasonic sealing. Furthermore, the loop component <b>8</b> comprising the loop elements of the mechanical fastener may be replaced by a nonwoven fabric adapted to be engaged with the hook component.</p>
