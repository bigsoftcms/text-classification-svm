<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) from provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/596,441, filed Sep. 23, 2005, by the inventors hereof, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to window hardware and more particularly to a modular, customizable finial system for curtain rods.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It will be appreciated that window coverings such as draperies are commonly suspended from decorative window hardware that comprises a pole and attached finials. Typically, the drapery or other window covering is fit over the pole and the finials are screwed into the ends of the pole. The poles are sold in a variety of colors, finishes and styles and the finials are sold in an even wider variety of styles, shapes colors, styles, finishes and materials. Typically, the finials and poles are sold as a set where the finials match the poles in color, style and finish. While this arrangement is widely employed it does not allow the customer to easily change the look of the window treatments because the customer must buy and install new poles and finials to replace the existing poles and finials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In attempt to solve this problem it is known to sell the finials separately from the poles where the user can buy different styles of finials that may be attached to the same pole. While this provides greater flexibility in the look of the window hardware it is not a satisfactory result because the finials do not necessarily match the poles. For example a black pole could be fitted with a mother of pearl finial having a brass collar where the different look of the brass trimmed finial mounted on a black pole make the components look as if they do not &#x201c;go together&#x201d;. As a result consumers that install black poles, for example, would only consider finials that had black collars. The desired flexibility and customization potential is limited because it is not commercially viable to stock finials in all possible combinations of finish, color and style.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, an improved modular window hardware system that allows customization is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The window hardware system of the invention comprises a variety of different types of poles in different finishes, colors and styles. The poles have a screwthread connection at each end thereof. A wide variety of different types of finials are also provided in different colors, materials, styles and shapes. A variety of different types of separate collars are also provided where certain types of collars may match the color, style and finish of the poles. A connection mechanism is provided to connect the finial, collar and pole to one another such that any combination of finial, collar and pole can be assembled. Because the collars are separate from the finials, any finial can be attached to any pole while achieving an aesthetically pleasing look because the collar can be selected to visually tie the finial and pole together. In another embodiment of the invention, the body of the finial can have a modular construction such that the finial can be assembled from a variety of components to create a custom look.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the hardware system of the invention comprises a variety of different types of poles <b>2</b> each of which has a different finish, color, material or the like. A variety of different types of collars <b>4</b> are also provided where the collars have different finish, colors material or the like. In one embodiment of the invention, some of the collars <b>4</b> have the same finish, color, and material as some of the poles <b>2</b> where at least one matching type of collar is provided for each type of pole. Collars that are different from the poles in color, finish or style but that coordinate with the poles are also contemplated. A plurality of different types of finials <b>6</b> are also provided where the finials may come in a wide variety of colors, finishes, styles and materials that may be very different than the colors, finishes and materials of the poles <b>2</b> and collars <b>4</b>. To create a complete window hardware assembly, the customer can, for example, purchase a pole of one type and purchase a finial of a second type and a pair of collars of a type that coordinates with the poles and/or finials. The collars <b>2</b> and finials <b>4</b> are attached to the pole to complete the assembly and provide aesthetically pleasing window hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One embodiment of the window hardware assembly of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where an end portion of a pole <b>2</b> has a threaded bore <b>8</b> formed in the end thereof. The finial <b>6</b> includes a threaded member <b>10</b> extending therefrom where the threaded member mates with the threaded bore <b>8</b>. The threaded member <b>10</b> may be attached to the finial via mounting structure <b>18</b> and it may be permanently fixed to the finial or it may be attached such as by a threaded connection. The collar <b>4</b> has a through hole <b>12</b> formed therein where the through hole <b>12</b> has a first large diameter section <b>14</b> that fits over the end of the pole <b>2</b>. The through hole <b>12</b> has a second large diameter portion <b>16</b> that fits over the threaded member <b>10</b> and mounting structure <b>18</b> of the finial <b>6</b>. A small diameter section <b>20</b> of through hole <b>12</b> connects the first and second large diameter sections to receive threaded member <b>10</b> such that the threaded member can extend completely through the collar <b>4</b>. To assemble the window hardware, the threaded member <b>10</b> is inserted through the through hole <b>12</b> in the collar <b>4</b> and is threadably attached to the threaded bore <b>8</b> on pole <b>2</b> to trap the collar between the finial and pole. The process is repeated on the opposite end of the pole <b>2</b> for the second finial. While the connection between member <b>10</b> and bore <b>8</b> is described as a threaded connection, it is to be understood that member <b>10</b> may be connected in bore <b>8</b> by a mechanism other than screwthreads. For example, the member <b>10</b> and bore <b>8</b> may have a friction fit, or the connection may be made by a mechanical connection such as a snap fit. Moreover, an adhesive may be used if desired. It is also possible to reverse the mating elements such that, for example, threaded member <b>10</b> is formed on the end of pole <b>2</b> and threaded bore <b>8</b> is formed on finial <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and is similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where like reference numerals are used to identify like components. Pole <b>2</b> has a large bore <b>22</b> formed in the end thereof. A plug <b>26</b> having a threaded bore <b>28</b> is friction fit into bore <b>22</b>. Threaded bore <b>28</b> threadably receives the threaded member <b>10</b> of finial <b>6</b> to fix the finial and collar <b>4</b> to the pole <b>2</b> as previously described. As previously described, it is to be understood that member <b>10</b> may be connected in bore <b>28</b> by a mechanism other than screwthreads. For example, the member <b>10</b> and bore <b>28</b> may have a friction fit, or the connection may be made by a mechanical connection such as a snap fit. Moreover, an adhesive may be used if desired. It is also possible to reverse the mating elements such that, for example, threaded member <b>10</b> is formed on the end of plug <b>26</b> and threaded bore <b>28</b> is formed on finial <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> where like reference numerals are used to identify like components previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The assembly consists of a finial <b>6</b> having a threads <b>30</b> formed at one end thereof. An adapter <b>32</b> having internal screw threads <b>36</b> that threadably engage threads <b>30</b> is also provided. A threaded member such as a bolt <b>38</b> is disposed in the cavity of adapter <b>32</b> formed by internal threads <b>36</b> and extends from the adapter via through hole <b>42</b>. The adapter <b>32</b> is screwed to the finial <b>6</b> with the threads <b>30</b> engaging threads <b>36</b> of the adapter. The threaded member <b>38</b> is trapped in adapter <b>32</b> and extends from the adapter via through hole <b>42</b>. The finial may be assembled to the pole <b>2</b> by screwing threaded member <b>38</b> into threaded bore <b>8</b> as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. While the connection between finial <b>6</b> and pole <b>2</b> is described as a threaded connection, it is to be understood that these members may be connected by a mechanism other than screwthreads as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the assembly is shown using the adapter structure described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the plug structure described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and like numerals are used to identify like components. Again, while the connection between finial <b>6</b> and pole <b>2</b> is described as a threaded connection, it is to be understood that these members may be connected by a mechanism other than screwthreads as previously described. The adapter structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is particularly well suited for use with glass finials although it may be used with finials of any material.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention has been described where the collars, finials and pole are connected to one another using a connector such as a screw thread to connect the finial to the pole where the collar is trapped between the finial and the pole. It is to be understood that the invention could also use separate connectors on the pole, finial and collars such that the collar is connected directly to the pole and the finial is connected to either the pole as shown in the figures or is connected directly to the collar. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> this arrangement can be effected by forming internal screw threads on the interior of section <b>14</b> that mate with external threads formed on pole <b>2</b>. The finial could then be attached as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where the threaded member engages an interior bore of the pole or the collar could be formed with screw threads that mate with screw threads formed on the finial such as threaded member <b>10</b>. Moreover, the threaded connections may be replaced by snap fit connections, friction fit connections or other mechanical or adhesive connecting mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another embodiment of a modular finial is shown at <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and includes a collar portion <b>60</b> and a cap portion <b>62</b>. Cap portion <b>62</b> includes a threaded member <b>64</b> extending therefrom that is inserted through a through hole formed in collar portion <b>60</b> so as to extend therefrom. The cap portion <b>62</b> and collar portion <b>60</b> may be made of the same material with the same finish, color and style. In one embodiment, the collar portion <b>60</b> and cap portion <b>62</b> are made to have the same color and finish as the pole <b>2</b>. Located between the cap portion <b>62</b> and collar portion <b>60</b> is an insert portion <b>66</b> that is made of a material that may be different from the cap portion <b>62</b> and collar portion <b>60</b> and that has a different finish and/or color. Different insert portions <b>66</b> can be purchased and used with different cap portions <b>62</b> and collar portions <b>60</b> such that an end user can customize the finial. The insert portion <b>66</b> is formed with a through hole that receives the threaded member <b>64</b> such that the threaded member can extend through the insert portion <b>66</b>. Located between the cap portion <b>62</b> and insert portion <b>66</b> and collar portion <b>60</b> and insert portion <b>66</b> may be disks <b>68</b> that form transition areas between the insert portion <b>66</b> and the cap portion <b>62</b> and collar portion <b>60</b>. The disks <b>68</b> are formed with through holes that receive the threaded member such that the threaded member <b>64</b> can extend therethrough. The disks <b>68</b> may be constructed of material different from or the same as the material of the cap portion <b>62</b>, collar portion <b>60</b> and/or insert portion <b>66</b>. While the finial <b>58</b> has been described with the threaded member <b>64</b> formed as part of the cap portion <b>62</b>, it is to be understood that the threaded member may be formed as a separate connector that is threaded into a mating threaded bore on the cap portion <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the connection between member <b>64</b> and bore <b>8</b> is described as a threaded connection, it is to be understood that member <b>64</b> may be connected in bore <b>8</b> by a mechanism other than screwthreads. For example, the member <b>64</b> and bore <b>8</b> may have a friction fit, or the connection may be made by a mechanical connection such as a snap fit. Moreover, an adhesive may be used if desired. It is also possible to reverse the mating elements such that, for example, threaded member <b>64</b> is formed on the end of pole <b>2</b> and threaded bore <b>8</b> is formed on finial cap <b>62</b>. It is also possible to use the plug as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> with the modular finial shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention has been described where the collar portion <b>60</b>, cap portion <b>62</b>, insert portion <b>66</b> and disks <b>68</b> are connected to one another and to pole <b>2</b> using a connector such as a screw thread to connect the cap portion <b>62</b> finial to the pole <b>2</b> where the other components are trapped between the cap portion and the pole. It is to be understood that the invention could also use separate connectors on the pole, cap portion, collar portion, insert portion and disks such that these elements are connected directly to one another. This arrangement can be effected by forming mating screw threads, snap fit or friction fit connectors, adhesive or other securement mechanisms on the facing surfaces of the components. The cap portion <b>62</b> would then be directly attached to the adjacent component such as disk <b>68</b> or insert portion <b>66</b> if no disk is used. The disk <b>68</b> would be directly attached to the insert portion <b>66</b> and so on where the collar portion <b>60</b> is directly attached to the pole <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To assemble the finial and window hardware of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the consumer purchases separately a rod, a cap portion and collar portion, and an insert portion. The disks may be provided with either the insert portion, collar portion or cap portions, or they may be purchased separately. Moreover the cap portion and collar portion may be purchased separately from one another. If the threaded member <b>64</b> is formed as part of the cap portion <b>62</b>, the threaded member is inserted through the first disk <b>68</b>, the insert portion <b>66</b>, the second disk <b>68</b> and collar portion <b>60</b> and screwed into the threaded bore <b>8</b> formed in the pole <b>2</b>. If the threaded member <b>64</b> is a separate component, it is first secured to either the pole <b>2</b> or the cap portion <b>62</b> and then inserted through the other components. The cap portion <b>62</b> is the tightened onto the pole <b>2</b> using the threaded member <b>64</b> to trap the components between the pole and the cap portion and complete the assembly of the finial. Where separate connectors are used on the facing surfaces of the components, the components would each be directly attached to the adjacent components. The same process is duplicated on the opposite end of the pole to complete the window hardware assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to providing an aesthetically more pleasing window hardware assembly, the modular system of the invention increases the number of options available to the end user and provides a system that allows the window hardware system to match a room interior d&#xe9;cor. Because of the cross-functional nature of the components in the system of the invention more choices can be provided to the consumer without increasing the number of stock components as would be required in the existing systems to provide the same number of choices.</p>
