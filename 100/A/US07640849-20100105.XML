<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to cooking appliances in which food articles are cooked between cooking surfaces of two cooking plates. The invention is particularly useful in grilling appliances for grilling meat, and is therefore described below with respect to this application.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many different types of electrical grilling appliances have been developed and are described in the patent literature, as shown, for example by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,181,455, 5,606,905, 6,016,741 and 6,192,788. However, efforts are continuously being made for health reasons to more efficiently remove grease and other fluids emanating from the food article during its grilling, and/or for reducing the grilling time, as well as for more conveniently controlling the grilling process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An object of the present invention is to provide a cooking appliance in general, and a grilling appliance in particular, having advantages in one or more of the above respects.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cooking appliance, comprising: a base for supporting the grill appliance on a flat horizontal surface; a lower grill plate pivotally mounted by a pivotal mounting on said base to a desired angular position with respect thereto; an upper grill plate pivotally mounted on the base over the lower grill plate to a desired angular position with respect to the lower grill plate and the base; said grill plate being formed with ribs defining channels for draining fluids from the food article to one of the edges of the grill plates; and an electrical heater for heating the two grill plates. The pivotal mountings of the lower and upper grill plates are such as to permit: (a) the upper grill plate to be pivotted to an open position with respect to the lower grill plate for introducing and removing of food articles between the two grill plates; (b) the upper grill plate then to be pivotted to a closed condition with respect to the lower grill plate for contacting the food article between the two grill plates; and (c) both plates in their closed condition to be pivotted to any desired angular position with respect to the base for draining fluids from the food article while being cooked between the two grill plates.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As will be described more particularly below, such a cooking appliance can cook (e.g. grill) the food articles in a minimum of time since it brings the heating surfaces of two cooking plates into direct with the opposite sides of the food article. Moreover, since the appliance enables the food articles to be cooked between the two cooking plates at any desired angular position of the cooking plates with respect to the base, the appliance can be used for removing, efficiently and to a relatively high degree, grease and other fluids emanating from the food articles during the cooking process.</p>

It is to be further understood that the embodiments described are for purposes of example only, and that the invention is capable of being embodied in other forms and applications than described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illustrated cooking appliance includes a base, generally designated <b>10</b>, for stably supporting the cooking appliance on a flat horizontal surface. Base <b>10</b> includes side walls <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> at its opposite sides having a first pair of arms <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) pivotally mounting a lower cooking plate <b>20</b>, and a second pair of arms <b>14</b> for pivotally mounting an upper cooking plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two side walls <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are inclined at their front ends. A control panel <b>40</b> is mounted on the inclined front portion of side wall <b>11</b>, and a display panel <b>50</b> is mounted on the inclined front portion of side wall <b>12</b>, such as to permit convenient control of the appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower cooking plate <b>20</b> is designed as a grill plate. It is provided with an upper surface <b>21</b> formed with a plurality of ribs defining channels for draining grease and other fluids emanating from the food article while it is being grilled. The upper cooking plate <b>30</b> is also designed as a grill plate and is also formed on its lower surface with ribs <b>31</b> defining similar channels for draining the liquid and other fluids from the food articles being cooked.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ribs <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> are oriented such that when the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are pivotted to a vertical or partially-vertical position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, respectively, the grease and other fluids emanating from the food articles being grilled are channeled downwardly towards the center region of the rear edge of the two grill plates. Base <b>10</b> supports a drip tray <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) in the center region, to catch the drippings from the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> during the grilling process. Drip tray <b>15</b> is preferably removable from base <b>10</b> to facilitate cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, each includes a handle <b>22</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, at their front portions manually graspable by the user to manually pivot the two plates as desired. When the two plates are pivotted to their closed condition, e.g. shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, with the food article between their grill surfaces, the two plates are releasable retained in the closed position by latching elements <b>23</b>, <b>33</b>, carried at the front ends of the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To facilitate the use of the illustrated appliance, it also includes a motor drive for driving the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, to their desired pivotal positions. Each grill plate may be driven by a separate drive motor, or the appliance could be provided with a single drive motor selectively coupleable to the two grill plates. Control of the electric motor or motors, as well as of the electrical heater heating the grill plates, is effected via control panel <b>40</b> and display panel <b>50</b> carried at the front portions of the two side walls <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Control panel <b>40</b> and display panel <b>50</b> are more particularly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the overall electrical control system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, control panel <b>40</b> includes a number of manipulatable elements, in the form of depressible keys <b>41</b>-<b>47</b>, for controlling the motor or motors driving the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, to their various possible positions, as described below, according to the grilling operation desired in any particular case.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Display panel <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, includes a window <b>51</b> for displaying the time of grilling, which may be preset by an Up-Time key <b>52</b> and a Down-Time key <b>53</b>. Display panel <b>50</b> further includes additional depressible keys <b>54</b>-<b>56</b> which may be used for controllably pre-heating the grill plates, if desired. Control panel <b>50</b> also includes indicator lights <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> for indicating power-on by indicator L<sub>p</sub>, and heat-on by indicator L<sub>h</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The overall electrical control system is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and therein generally designated <b>60</b>. Thus, it includes inputs from the various control keys in control panel <b>40</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the various control keys in display panel <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. These inputs are used by the control system to control the timer display <b>51</b>, the Power-On indicator <b>57</b>, and the Heat-On indicator <b>58</b> as briefly described above. Control system <b>60</b> also control the heaters <b>61</b> for both grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, motor <b>62</b> for the lower grill plate <b>20</b>, motor <b>63</b> for the upper grill plate <b>30</b>, and the timer control <b>64</b> which controls the time displayed within display <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The manner of operating the illustrated electrical grilling appliance will be apparent from the above description.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, may be pivotted to an open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to permit placing the food articles to be grilled on top of the lower grill plate <b>20</b>. After the food article is so placed, the upper grill plate <b>30</b> may be pivotted to its closed condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such that the food article is firmly contacted between the grill surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> of the two grill plates. The two grill plates, while in the closed condition, may then be pivotted to any desired inclination according to the amount of grease and other fluids to be drained from the food articles being grilled. For example, if it is desired to effect maximum drainage, the two grill plates would be pivotted to their vertical positions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with respect to the base <b>10</b> so as to exploit drainage by gravity to a maximum extent. If something less than maximum removal of the grease is desired, the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be pivotted to some intermediate position, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, whereupon the drainage by gravity would be to a lesser degree than when the plates are pivotted to the vertical position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. If minimum removal of such liquids is desired, the two grill plates could be retained in their horizontal position with respect to base <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, whereupon the grease and other liquids separating from the food articles would accumulate in the channels defined by the grill surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> of the grill plates.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In any position involving gravity drainage, the draining liquids are channeled by rib surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> of the two grill plates <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> towards the center region of the lower edge of the two grill plates, and from there, into the drip tray <b>15</b> underlying the two grill plates.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It will thus be seen that the described appliance drains the grease and other liquids from the food articles being grilled in an efficient manner, because of the use of gravity, and also in a manner which may be selectively controlled by pre-selecting the inclination of the two grill plates with respect to the base during the grilling operation. In addition, since the grilling is effected between two grill plates in contact with the food articles, a minimum grilling time is required. The above-described electrical controls also permit the grilling operation to be performed very conveniently.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the invention has been described with respect to a grilling appliance, it will be appreciated that the invention could also be implemented in other types of cooking appliances, where food articles, including non-meat food products, are to be cooked between two cooking surfaces. Many other variations, modifications and applications of the invention will be apparent.</p>
