<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wing-type rotary mower apparatus with a hydraulically powered over-center self-locking wing lift that extends between the central mower deck and the wing mower deck(s) to effect wing movement from a working position to a locked transport position. The lift mechanism comprises a double acting cylinder, a bell crank, and a pair of lift links that are pivotally connected. When the cylinder is retracted the bell crank rotates inward towards the center of the apparatus transferring the movement through the lift links to the mower wing(s). The rotational force on the bell crank about a fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck goes from an outward force reacted to by the cylinder to an inward force supported by the stop seat on the central mower deck; effectively locking the wing(s).

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present invention pertains to a winged rotary mower apparatus with a hydraulically powered over-center self-locking wing lift mechanism whereby the wing or wings lift between a working position to a locked transport position.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Rotary mowers comprising of a center section and one or two wings are used to maintain roadside ditches. In performing this job the mowers are required to travel many roadways including main highways and many well-traveled secondary roads. Due to transport and safety regulations and for convenience when transporting the wing(s) are folded up.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet this demand, conventionally, rotary mower wings fold up 90 degrees using a single acting hydraulic cylinder (retractable hydraulic actuator); gravity is relied on to lower them. They are then pinned in place in the vertical position for safety in transport. This method of lifting and lowering the wings causes both safety concerns and inconvenience to the operator. The use of a single acting hydraulic cylinder allows hydraulic creep. This places the operator in danger when applying or removing the pins because the hydraulic creep can cause binding making the task difficult while the operator relies on the tractor's passive hydraulic system to prevent the wing(s) from falling, presenting a potentially dangerous situation. When the wings are raised vertical to 90 degrees they often resist coming down especially if the mower is not on a perfectly level surface or the wing hinges bind due to rust and corrosion forcing the operator to manually push them down, again placing the operator in a potentially dangerous position. U.S. Pat. No. 6,647,705 Ewanocho et al. (CA 2391271) addresses one aspect of this problem with cushioning struts mounted across the wing hinge to assist in lowering the wings; but still a pin is used to lock them in an upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be desirable to have a wing lift that would allow the operator to lift and lower the rotary mower wings without leaving the tractor, providing safety and convenience for the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to have a wing lift that would allow the operator to raise the wings into a locked transport position without the operator leaving the tractor, providing safety and convenience for the operator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention in one broad aspect pertains to a rotary mower including a central section, having ground wheels, mowing deck, and a center section hinge. One or two wing section(s) having a ground wheel, mowing deck, and a wing hinge, hinged to the central section hinge on an axis for movement from an aligned working position through to a less then vertical transport position. A hydraulically powered over-center self-locking wing lift extends between the center section and the wing section to effect the wing movement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is the object of the present invention to provide a self-locking wing lift that enables the operator to safely and conveniently lower the rotary mower wing(s) into a working position and raise the rotary mower wing(s) into a locked transport position operative from the tractor seat.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a over-center self-locking wing lift mechanism comprising of a double acting cylinder (extensible and retractable hydraulic actuator) that is pivotally connected at an inner upper fixed point on the central mower deck on one end and it's rod end is pivotally connected to the center most point on a bell crank. The bell crank is pivotally connected at a second point about an outer lower fixed central pivot point on the center mower deck. The bell crank is pivotally connected at a third point to a pair of slotted lift links. The slotted lift links are pivotally connected at a second point to a fixed pivot point on the wing(s).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the hydraulic cylinder retracts the bell crank rotates about the lower fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck inward towards the center of the apparatus; the opposing rotational force on the bell crank is outward towards the wing mower deck(s). The movement is transferred from the bell crank through the slotted lift links, to the wing section(s). This raises the wing(s) to a less then vertical position about the wing hinge axis between the wing section and center section. The center (neutral) position is reached where the pivotal connections on the pair of slotted lift links are in-line with the fixed central pivot point on the center section, at this position the rotational force caused by the wing load on the bell crank decreases to zero. The bell crank rotates inward from this position; to the over-center position; causing wing load to reverses from an outward rotational force on the bell crank to an inward rotational force on the bell crank about the fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck. At the over-center position both pivotal connections on the slotted lift links are below the fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck and the bell crank hits the stop seat on the central mower deck, locking the wing(s) in a less then vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Extending the cylinder causes the bell crank to rotate outward towards the wing section(s) about the outer lower fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck, lowering the wing(s) out of the locked position. The mechanism passes the center (neutral) position where the wing load on the bell crank switches to an outward rotational force about the outer lower fixed central pivot point on the central mower deck, and the wing(s) are lowered through the slotted lift links into the working position. The slotted lift links allows the wing(s) to float in the working position.</p>

The reaction force on the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> caused by the mass of the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>,<b>3</b> is now zero.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> continues to retract until the bell crank stop shaft <b>8</b> on the bell crank <b>5</b> hits the stop seat <b>9</b> on the central mower deck <b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The force vector between the pivotal connection A on the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the pivotal connection C on the pair of slotted lift links <b>6</b> is below the central pivotal connection B on the central mower deck <b>1</b>. This is the over-center position in the movement. The rotational force caused by the mass of the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> on the bell crank <b>5</b> is inward about the fixed central pivot point connection B on the central mower deck <b>1</b> towards the center of the mower. In the over-center position the stop seat <b>9</b> on the central mower deck <b>1</b> supports the load (force) caused by the mass of the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, effectively locking the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> in a less then vertical position (transport position).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Extending the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> causes the bell crank <b>5</b> to rotate outward about the fixed pivotal connection B on the central mower deck <b>1</b> towards the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> lifting the over-center self-locking wing lift mechanism WLM out of the locked position.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The slot <b>6</b><i>a </i>at the slotted lift links <b>6</b> allows the wing mower deck(s) <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to float when in the working position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention thus provides a wing-type rotary mower apparatus where the wing or wings of the mower can be lifted between a working position and a locked transport position using the hydraulically powered over-center self-locking wing lift mechanism operative from the tractor seat.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The forgoing is considered illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further since numerous changes and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all such suitable changes or modifications in structure or operation which may be resorted to are intended to fall within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
