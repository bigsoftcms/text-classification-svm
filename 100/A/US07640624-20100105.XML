<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the floor care equipment field and, more particularly, to a floor care appliance incorporating a novel dirt cup.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bagless vacuum cleaner technology has long been known in the art. Japanese Patent Applications 56-136642 and 56-136650 both published in 1981 disclose an upright vacuum cleaner with a dust collection chamber in a dirt cup that removably connects to an opening of the main unit to facilitate user convenience during the emptying of the cleaner. A removable filter fills an opening at the bottom of the dust chamber and serves to separate dust from air drawn through the vacuum cleaner by the fan and motor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to an improved dust collection assembly for a floor care appliance such as an upright or canister vacuum cleaner or even an extractor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with the purposes of the present invention as described herein, a new and improved floor care appliance is provided. That floor care appliance includes a housing, a suction generator carried on the housing and a dirt cup carried on the housing. The dirt cup is provided to collect dirt and debris drawn into the appliance by the suction generator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The dirt cup is characterized by a sidewall, a bottom wall and a top wall. The bottom wall includes a dump door having a latch for securing the dump door in a closed position. The top wall includes an actuator for releasing the latch and opening the dump door in order to empty the contents from the dirt cup into an underlying trash receptacle. The sidewall carries a linkage for operatively connecting the actuator to the latch.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically describing the invention, the top wall includes a carrying handle. The actuator may be provided on the carrying handle if desired. Still further, the carrying handle may be made to pivot relative to a main body of the top wall. Further, the carrying handle includes a cavity and the actuator includes an elongated lug that extends through the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The linkage on the sidewall includes an elongated member mounted so as to allow sliding movement relative to the sidewall. This sliding movement may be provided in a number of ways including a cooperating guide track and channel arrangement wherein either the guide track or the channel is provided on the elongated member and the other of the guide track or channel is provided on the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The elongated member includes a first end engaging the elongated lug of the actuator and a second end for engaging the latch. The second end may be provided with a cam surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The latch includes a locking element that engages a locking tab when the dump door is in the closed position. In one possible embodiment the latch is resilient. The sidewall carries either the locking tab or the locking element and the other of the locking tab and the locking element is provided on the dump door.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bottom wall includes a frame. The dump door is connected to the frame by a hinge. The frame includes a mounting flange engaging the sidewall and securing the bottom wall to the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one possible embodiment the top wall is a lid. The main body of the top wall includes a mounting skirt that engages the sidewall and secures the top wall thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a method is provided for constructing a dirt cup for a floor care appliance. The method comprises the steps of providing a dirt cup with a top wall, a bottom wall and a sidewall, positioning a dump door in the bottom wall and positioning an actuator for opening the dump door on the top wall.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following description there is shown and described a preferred embodiment of the invention, simply by way of illustration of one of the modes best suited to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modification in various, obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</p>

It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention also includes and this patent also covers other floor cleaning appliances such as canister vacuum cleaners and extractors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> includes a housing, generally designated by reference numeral <b>12</b>, including a nozzle section <b>14</b> and a canister section <b>16</b>. As is known in the art, the canister section <b>16</b> is pivotally connected to the nozzle section <b>14</b> to aid the operator in manipulating the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> to and fro across the floor. Wheels (not shown) carried on the housing <b>12</b> allow the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> to be moved smoothly across the floor. As illustrated, the nozzle section <b>14</b> is equipped with a nozzle inlet <b>18</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the nozzle inlet <b>18</b> also includes a rotary agitator <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The canister section <b>16</b> houses a suction generator <b>22</b> (i.e. a fan and motor assembly) and a dirt cup <b>24</b> having a dirt collection chamber <b>26</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). The canister section <b>16</b> also includes a control handle <b>28</b> and an actuator switch <b>30</b> for controlling the operation of the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> and thereby driving the rotary agitator <b>20</b> and the suction generator <b>22</b> as desired. In the illustrated embodiment the actuator switch <b>30</b> comprises a series of touch controls.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">During the cleaning operation the rotary agitator <b>20</b> brushes and beats dirt and debris from the nap of an underlying carpet being cleaned. The dirt and debris are then drawn by the suction generator <b>22</b> through the nozzle inlet <b>18</b> into the dirt cup <b>24</b> and through any filter element (not shown) that might be provided in the dirt cup. Dirt and debris are collected in the dirt collection chamber <b>26</b>. The airstream is then directed over the motor of the suction generator <b>22</b> to provide cooling before being routed through a final filter, to remove any carbon particles stripped from the brushes of the motor by the airstream, before exhausting the airstream through an exhaust port <b>34</b> into the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The dirt cup <b>24</b> will now be described in detailed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b, </i><b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>5</b>, the dirt cup includes a top wall <b>36</b>, a sidewall <b>38</b> and a dump door <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment the top wall <b>36</b> is a lid comprising a main body having a mounting skirt <b>44</b> that threads or snaps onto the sidewall <b>38</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b>, the top wall <b>36</b> also includes a carrying handle <b>46</b>. The carrying handle <b>46</b> is arcuate in shape and includes an inwardly projecting pivot pin <b>48</b> at each end. Each pivot pin <b>48</b> is captured in a notch provided in the top wall <b>36</b> so that the handle <b>46</b> is allowed to freely pivot relative to the main body. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the handle <b>46</b> includes a first section <b>52</b> and a second section <b>54</b> connected together by fasteners such as screws <b>55</b>. A cavity <b>56</b> is formed between the two handle sections <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A dump door actuator <b>58</b> is carried by the handle <b>46</b>. The dump door actuator <b>58</b> includes a sliding actuator switch <b>60</b> that is received in and runs along the guide track <b>62</b> formed by the two handle sections <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Additionally, the dump door actuator <b>58</b> includes an elongated lug <b>64</b> extending from the actuator switch <b>60</b> and a biasing spring <b>65</b> held in the cavity <b>56</b> and received over the lug <b>64</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the lug <b>64</b> extends through the cavity <b>56</b> to the end of the handle <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bottom wall or dump door <b>40</b> is connected by means of hinge <b>72</b> at one side thereof to the sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup <b>24</b>. More specifically, the hinge <b>72</b> is received in a cooperating cavity <b>73</b> formed in the sidewall <b>38</b>. A bracket <b>75</b> functions to overlie the hinge <b>72</b> and capture it in the cavity <b>73</b>. The bracket <b>72</b> is secured to the sidewall by means of a screw or other fastener (not shown). When the dump door <b>40</b> is closed, a seal <b>74</b> extending around the entire periphery of the dump door sealingly engages a lip <b>68</b> on the sidewall <b>38</b> so as to seal the dirt cup <b>24</b> and prevent the passage of air, dust and dirt from the dirt cup into the environment</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A latch, generally designated by reference numeral <b>76</b>, is provided at the side of the dump door <b>40</b> oppositive the hinge <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>). In the illustrated embodiment the latch <b>76</b> comprises a cooperating locking tab <b>82</b> and a resilient locking element <b>78</b> made from plastic or other appropriate material. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>c, </i>the resilient locking element <b>78</b> is substantially U-shaped and includes an aperture <b>80</b> for receiving and holding the locking tab <b>82</b> carried by the sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup <b>24</b>. Thus, when the dump door <b>40</b> is in the closed position the locking element <b>78</b> is engaging the locking tab <b>82</b>. This causes the seal <b>74</b> around the dump door <b>40</b> to seat against the lip <b>68</b> thereby closing the dirt cup <b>24</b>. This is the position of the dump door <b>40</b> when the dirt cup <b>24</b> is mounted in the canister section <b>16</b> and the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> is operated to clean a floor.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At some point during or following floor cleaning, it may become necessary or desirable to empty the dirt cup <b>24</b>. In order to achieve this end the dirt cup <b>24</b> is first removed from the canister section <b>16</b>. This can be done by engaging the carrying handle <b>46</b> (then in a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) with the fingers and pivoting the handle up slightly from the seated position. As the handle pivots the latching lugs <b>84</b> are released from the canister section <b>16</b> thereby allowing the dirt cup <b>24</b> to be freely removed from the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b>. During the removal operation it should be appreciated that the dump door <b>40</b> remains closed and sealed at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After positioning the dirt cup <b>24</b> over a trash can, garbage can or other dirt receptacle, the operator engages the dump door actuator <b>58</b> in order to open the dump door <b>40</b> and empty the dirt cup <b>24</b>. More specifically, the operator presses a finger against the sliding actuator <b>60</b> and slides the dump door actuator <b>58</b> along the guide track <b>62</b> in the direction of action arrow A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) against the biasing force of the spring <b>65</b>. This causes the lug <b>64</b> of the dump door actuator <b>58</b> to be extended further from the cavity <b>56</b> in the carrying handle <b>46</b>. The end of the lug <b>64</b> engages a first end <b>86</b> of a linkage element <b>88</b> mounted on the sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup <b>24</b>. More specifically, the linkage element <b>88</b> is mounted so as to allow free sliding movement relative to the sidewall <b>38</b>. This may be accomplished by substantially any means known in the art including but not limited to cooperating rails and channels provided on the linkage element <b>88</b> and the exterior surface of the sidewall <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the sidewall <b>38</b> includes a substantially L-shaped guide track <b>100</b> that forms a channel <b>102</b>. The linkage element <b>88</b> includes a cavity <b>104</b> formed by the two sidewalls <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the top wall <b>110</b>. A guide track follower includes a first series of guide tabs <b>112</b> extending from the first sidewall <b>106</b> and a second series of guide tabs <b>114</b> extending from the sidewall <b>108</b>. As illustrated, the first series of guide tabs <b>112</b> are captured for free sliding movement in the channel <b>102</b> of the guide track <b>100</b>. Simultaneously, the second series of guide tabs <b>114</b> engage the upstanding post <b>116</b> of the guide track to effectively hold the first series of guide tabs <b>112</b> in the channel <b>102</b>. Two stops <b>118</b>, one adjacent each end of the linkage element <b>88</b>, engage the ends of the guide track <b>100</b> to limit the range or extent of the sliding movement of the linkage element <b>88</b> on the guide track <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the lug <b>64</b> is moved in the direction of action arrow A, it engages the first end <b>86</b> of the linkage element <b>88</b> and forces the linkage element downward along the sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup in the direction of action arrow B (note <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>). As this occurs the second end <b>90</b> of the linkage element <b>88</b> engages the locking element <b>78</b> of the latch <b>76</b>. More specifically, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>the second end <b>90</b> of the linkage element <b>88</b> includes a cam surface <b>92</b> that cooperatively engages a cam surface <b>94</b> carried on the locking element <b>78</b>. This forces the locking element <b>78</b> in an outward direction (note action arrow C) until the locking element is clear of the locking tab <b>82</b>. At that point in time the force of gravity acting upon the dump door <b>40</b> and the dirt and debris in the dirt cup <b>24</b> causes the dump door to swing open (note <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>) and the dirt and debris falls from the collection chamber <b>26</b> of the dirt cup into the underlying trash receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After the dirt cup <b>24</b> has been emptied, the dump door <b>40</b> is pivoted closed and the locking element <b>78</b> is resiliently latched to the locking tab <b>82</b> to hold the dump door in the closed position. The linkage element <b>88</b> is free to shift upward in the direction of action arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>since the biasing spring <b>65</b> previously returned the dump door actuator to the home or locked position. The dirt cup <b>24</b> is then reinserted in the canister section <b>16</b> and the vacuum cleaner <b>10</b> is again ready for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In summary, numerous benefits result from employing the concepts of the present invention. By locating the dump door actuator <b>58</b> on the handle <b>46</b> where the actuator switch <b>60</b> may be readily engaged with the thumb, the dirt cup <b>24</b> may be conveniently emptied with use of a single hand. The linkage element <b>88</b> is mounted for sliding movement on the exterior sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup <b>24</b> where it is isolated from dirt and debris held inside the dirt cup. As a consequence, the possibility of that dirt and debris interfering or jamming proper operation of that linkage is absolutely avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b, </i>the sidewall <b>38</b> is round and the dirt cup <b>24</b> is cylindrical in shape. Further, the dirty air inlet <b>96</b> provided in the sidewall <b>38</b> is tangentially oriented in order to provide cyclonic air flow in the dirt cup <b>24</b>. While the illustrated embodiment provides cyclonic air flow, it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to dirt cups providing cyclonic air flow. In fact, the inlet could be provided in the sidewall in an orientation other than tangential or in the top wall. Similarly, the outlet from the dirt cup could be provided in the sidewall or the top wall as desired. Further, while a single, round sidewall <b>38</b> is disclosed and illustrated, it should be appreciated that the sidewall could be polygonal if desired. Still further, it should be appreciated that while the illustrated embodiment shows the locking tab <b>82</b> on the sidewall <b>38</b> of the dirt cup <b>24</b> and the resilient locking element <b>78</b> on the dump door <b>40</b>, the relative positions of the locking tab and locking element could be reversed if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally and equitably entitled. The drawings and preferred embodiments do not and are not intended to limit the ordinary meaning of the claims and their fair and broad interpretation in any way.</p>
