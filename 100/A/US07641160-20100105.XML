<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus that is adapted to reduce wobble in a tripod that is used to hold an optical instrument, includes a triangular shaped base plate that includes an attachment to each leg of the tripod. The base plate includes slots at each corner or apex thereof that provides for an adjustment range sufficient for most types of tripods. A member that is attached to each leg of the tripod is attached to each corner of the base plate. A lighted carousel that includes a battery operated light and is adapted to hold a plurality of lenses is disposed above the base plate. According to a modification, the slots are eliminated from the base plate and an adjustment bar having a slot therein is attached at one end to a modified base plate and, at a remaining end, to a member that is attached to each of the legs of the tripod.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention, in general, relates to tripods and, more particularly, to devices that attach to and stabilize a tripod for a telescope and which support lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Amateur astronomers have telescopes that are supported by a tripod. This is well known in the arts. Similarly, the benefits of an equatorial mount or of a motor drive for use in concert with a tripod are also well known in the astronomical arts. Basically tripods both steady and orient the telescope while motor drive mechanisms are used to assist in the tracking of celestial objects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of sizes, types, and configurations of tripods currently exist as offered by the various manufacturers, but virtually all telescopes work best for astronomical viewing when they are used in conjunction with a tripod.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As anyone who has ever used an astronomical telescope knows, it is important that it be steady. Even a small amount of wobble is annoying when the magnification ratios multiply its apparent effect.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Even the best tripods are not steady enough. Every astronomer wishes that the tripod supported the telescope in a more steady fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is another problem all astronomers face and that is one of lens selection. This problem is indeed vexing because it is not possible to use just one lens when viewing. Different lenses provide all manner of enhanced benefits in viewing. These benefits provide variations in magnification, clarity of detail, revelation of color detail, filtering, and field of view, just to name a few. The astronomer must often change lenses during viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problem is that there is simply no way to store lenses for ready identification and quick access while viewing. There is very little light available to even attempt to determine which lens to select.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the lenses are not stored in a safe manner. They can bump into one another and become scratched, thereby degrading their performance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Astronomical viewing is accomplished at night. That is the only time when dim celestial objects can be seen. The darker the night, the better the conditions are for viewing dim objects, such as nebulae. Unfortunately, pitch black nights do not make it easy for astronomers to change their lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, many astronomers carry a small flashlight that they use to ferret out the desired lenses from a container or tray. The movement of the flashlight can interfere with the viewing pleasure of others.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This is because it takes time for eyes to &#x201c;dark adapt&#x201d;, that is for the pupils to fully dilate. When a nearby viewer notices a flashlight out of the corner of his eye he is inclined to look toward it. If he glances in that direction and a flash of light is carelessly directed toward him, it can instantly cause his pupils to contract.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pupils of the eye are adapted to instantly contract but it can take several minutes for them to fully dilate. Therefore, the use of flashlights are in some circles frowned upon because they can be directed toward other astronomers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Even the flashlight itself is something that must be found before it can be used. If it is stored, for example, in the same tray the lenses are placed, there is risk that the fingers of the user can make contact with the glass of a lens while he is &#x201c;feeling&#x201d; in the dark for the flashlight. The oils that are on all human skin can degrade the coatings that are on the lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Besides, even flashlights can be misplaced.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">How then can astronomers steady their tripod, safely store their lenses so they are not damaged, provide easy access to them, and gently illuminate the lenses for proper selection without annoying other astronomers who are nearby? Up until now there has been no effective solution for any of these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly there exists today a need for a tripod stabilizer and lighted lens carousel that helps to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Clearly, such an apparatus would be a useful and desirable device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">2. Description of Prior Art</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring primarily now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown, a tripod stabilizer and lighted lens carousel, identified in general by the reference numeral <b>10</b> and hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the carousel <b>10</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Three tripod legs, identified by the reference numerals <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are shown in dashed lines and the carousel <b>10</b> is disposed in the middle of the three tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Most tripods also have a tripod leg support bracket, identified by the reference numerals <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> that are each hingedly attached to one of the three tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. The axis of hinge attachment is shown on one of the tripod leg support brackets <b>7</b> and is identified by reference numeral <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are known existing types of devices.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, in use, typically extend to a central point, identified in general by the reference numeral <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In prior art designs, even if the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are allowed to meet in the central point <b>12</b>, they are attached together by a bolt and a nut (not shown) and are still able to pivot from side to side.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, the support they provided to further stabilize the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is minimal. The tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, if used as intended, keep the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> from opening up but they do not further steady the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the instant disclosure, the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> still extend to the central point <b>12</b> where they are fastened together and to the center of a triangular plate <b>14</b> by the use of a threaded knurled knob <b>16</b> (shown in dashed lines).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The knurled knob <b>16</b> passes through a central hole in the triangular plate <b>14</b> and enters into the bottom of a first post <b>18</b>, into which it is threaded and tightened by hand.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">This secures the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> at the central point <b>12</b> to each other and to the triangular plate <b>14</b> and it also secures the first post <b>18</b> in an upright manner perpendicular with respect to the plane of the triangular plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A collar <b>20</b> is attached proximate the top of the first post <b>18</b> and a wing nut <b>22</b> is threaded to the collar <b>20</b> and, when tightened, bears upon a second post <b>24</b> that is disposed in the first post <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second post <b>24</b> and the first post <b>18</b> share the same longitudinal axis. The outside diameter of the second post <b>24</b> is less than the inside diameter of the first post <b>18</b>. Therefore, the second post <b>24</b> is adapted to extend longitudinally with respect to the first post <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The wing nut <b>22</b> is loosened and the second post <b>24</b> is extended as desired to optimally position the carousel <b>10</b> for use, as is described in greater detail hereinafter. The wing nut <b>22</b> is then tightened to secure the second post <b>24</b> where desired.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Once secured, both the first post <b>18</b> and the second post <b>24</b> are fixed in position relative to the triangular plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Only a portion of each of the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are shown. They each extend downward to the ground and upward to a central area to which is included (i.e., attached) the necessary mountings to facilitate attachment of an astronomical telescope (not shown) and any other equipment, such as a motor drive (not shown). These are well known in the arts and are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At each of the corners of the triangular plate <b>14</b> is included an elongated portion <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>, each of which includes a slot <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>28</b><i>c </i>therein. Each slot <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>28</b><i>c </i>includes a longitudinal center axis that, if extended inward, passes through the central point <b>12</b> and, if extended outward, passes through the center of one of the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A wing mounting nut <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c </i>each passes through one of the slots <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and also through one of the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and is tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The slots <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>allow for a sufficient range of adjustment in the positioning of the wing mounting nuts <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>along the longitudinal axis of the slots <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>so that the wing mounting nuts <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>will each be able to pass through one of the holes provided in virtually all of the common types of the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> that are currently available.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The ability to tighten each of the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> to the triangular plate <b>14</b> at both the central point <b>12</b> and also at a location that is disposed away from the central point <b>12</b> (i.e., in the slot <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of the elongated portions <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>; <b>26</b><i>c</i>) firmly secures each of the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> to the triangular plate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Accordingly, the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are detachably-attachable with respect to the triangular plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Not only are the tripod legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> prevented from movement in or out with respect to the central point <b>12</b> but each of the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> is prevented from experiencing any side to side movement, as is shown by arrow <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">This configuration greatly increases the stability of the tripod.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The second post <b>24</b> extends upward and terminates in a bearing assembly <b>34</b> that is attached to a carousel tray <b>36</b>. The carousel tray <b>36</b> is adapted to pivot in a circle about the longitudinal axis of the second post <b>24</b> as shown by arrow <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The carousel tray <b>36</b>. preferably includes a side lip <b>40</b> that extends around its perimeter and a plurality of lens holes <b>42</b> of any preferred diameter. The lens holes <b>42</b> allow for placing a lens (not shown) in through the lens holes <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each lens is placed into one of the lens holes <b>42</b> from the top of the carousel tray <b>36</b>. Each lens naturally has a larger diameter neck that prevents it from fully passing through the carousel tray <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Any number of dividers <b>44</b> may be used to further partition the carousel tray <b>36</b> into smaller compartments <b>46</b>. The compartments <b>46</b> may or may not have any of the lens holes <b>42</b> therein. If the lens holes <b>42</b> are omitted from any of the compartments <b>46</b>, small incidental items (not shown) may be stored there for ready access, as is described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Attached to a rim <b>48</b> that extends around the side lip <b>40</b> are attached a pair of brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>by the use of a pair of machine screws and nuts <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>extend upward and inwards and are attached to a battery powered light <b>54</b> by the use of a pair, of screws <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>. The brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>provide a frame for supporting the light <b>54</b> above the carousel tray <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The battery powered light <b>54</b> includes a soft diffuser lens <b>58</b> attached thereto. To turn the light <b>54</b> on, the diffuser lens <b>58</b> is pressed upward. To turn the light <b>54</b> off, the diffuser lens <b>58</b> is again pressed upward.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The light <b>54</b> is a well known type of commercially available product that uses four &#x201c;AA&#x201d; size batteries and which casts a soft light that does not excessively hamper night vision (i.e., it does not cause the pupils of the user or others nearby to excessively contract).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It gently illuminates all objects that are placed in the carousel tray <b>36</b> for ready identification and easy selection. As the carousel tray <b>36</b> rotates and is adjustable to the preferred height, a convenient way to steady the tripod and to display the lenses is provided during astronomical viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, there are a few specialty tripods that are commercially available that do not have the tripod leg support brackets <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. Accordingly, a modified carousel <b>100</b> is provided for such instances.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The modified carousel <b>100</b> includes a smaller modified triangular plate <b>102</b>. Two (of three) modified tripod legs <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are shown in dashed lines.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The three modified tripod legs <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> each include a member <b>108</b> that is attached thereto and which includes a hole therein. The members <b>108</b> are normally supplied by the manufacturer of the specialty tripod.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An adjustment bar <b>110</b> is attached at one end thereof to each of the members <b>108</b> by a bolt and wing nut, identified in general by the reference numeral <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Each of the adjustment bars <b>110</b> includes an elongated slot <b>114</b>. An adjustment bolt and nut <b>116</b> are used to tighten each of the adjustment bars <b>110</b> to the modified triangular plate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The inside of each of the adjustment bars <b>110</b> includes a radius, identified in general by the reference numeral <b>118</b>. The radius permits placement of the adjustment bars <b>110</b> as close to a bearing <b>120</b> that is secured to the center of modified triangular plate <b>102</b> by a center bolt <b>122</b> as may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The center bolt <b>122</b> passes through a bezel <b>124</b> and secures a rotating arbor <b>126</b> in position. The rotating arbor <b>126</b> is adapted to pivot in a circle about the center bolt <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The rotating arbor <b>126</b> includes bracketry <b>128</b> attached thereto. The bracketry <b>128</b> is attached to a modified light frame <b>130</b> shown in dashed lines. The modified light frame <b>130</b> is used to support the light <b>54</b> above the carousel tray <b>36</b> (also shown in dashed lines).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, the carousel tray <b>36</b> is suspended below the modified triangular plate <b>102</b> where it is adapted to rotate in a circle, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The invention has been shown, described, and illustrated in substantial detail with reference to the presently preferred embodiment. It will be understood by those skilled in this art that other and further changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>
