<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Agricultural implements, such as seed distribution machines towed by tractors, are often employed to distribute materials such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, other chemicals, and other materials along the ground as they travel. Commonly, slurry of a given material is separated into finely-granulated particles and then distributed in a highly controlled manner (e.g., one particle at a time) by one or more meters that are positioned at different locations along the implement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Seed distribution machines generally include a laterally extending toolbar that supports a plurality of parallel planting units (also known as row units). The toolbar is typically coupled to a tractor or like vehicle through a frame suitable for towing the planting assembly along a field. Each row unit includes a seed meter to dispense seeds at a controlled rate into a seed furrow as the meter is advanced above and along the seed furrow during operation. One such seed metering assembly is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,401,638 assigned to Case Corp., Racine, Wis., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for the purpose of general background information. Generally, seeds are delivered to the metering assembly from a seed reservoir located on the row unit or, alternatively, from a smaller container fed from a large centralized reservoir used to feed all or a portion of the row units.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Air pressure differential seed meters, which are commonly known as air seed meters, are generally of two types, the first being a positive pressure type meter, and the second relying upon negative pressure or a vacuum. A positive pressure air seed metering mechanism includes rotating disc defining apertures extending therethrough that are sized to retain one or more seeds to be planted. The metering mechanism is connected to an air pump that blows air into the seed chamber and onto the surface of the disc. The high pressure caused by the air pump creates a high pressure in the chamber that forces seeds from a seed mass into the apertures where they are retained for subsequent release into the seed furrow as the seed member rotates. Vacuum seed meters typically include a vacuum source coupled to a separate chamber on the opposite side of the seed disc from the seed mass in the metering assembly. The vacuum pressure communicates through the disc apertures, and is sufficiently strong to draw the seed mass into the seed disc apertures. The seeds are held in the apertures until the disc rotates the seeds to the seed discharge area of the metering mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some seeding machines have pneumatic, seed-on-demand, delivery systems in which the row unit seed reservoirs are automatically refilled with seed as needed from a main reservoir. Pneumatic, seed-on-demand, delivery systems automatically direct seed from a main seed reservoir to a plurality of individual row units. Each of the individual row units has an auxiliary seed reservoir for receiving the seed, a seed meter for metering the seed from the auxiliary seed reservoir, and a furrow opener into which the metered seed is deposited. A fan is used to create pressurized air that forms an air stream on which the seed is carried to the row units. These systems automatically replenish the auxiliary reservoirs as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pneumatic, seed-on-demand, seeding machines and other systems employ two large central seed reservoirs: one located on each side of the main frame. In these seeding machines the left seed reservoir supplies seed to all of the row units on the left side of the seeding machine, while the right seed reservoir supplies seed to all of the row units on the right side of the seeding machine. To this end, seeding systems employing centralized reservoirs require a large number of hoses to transport the seeds from the central seed reservoirs to the individual row units. This configuration of the seed distribution machines requires the seed delivery hoses to take sharp turns of up to 180 degrees, which inhibits the seed flow. These sharp turns create inefficiencies, add resistance to the seed flow, require extra supports to contain the hoses, and greatly reduce the cosmetic appearance of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In many cases, these systems have advantageously been designed to collapse into a position providing a reduced profile to facilitate transport between seeding operations, for example, over a road. Such systems typically include a small toolbar that is supplemented by a pair of wings that extend beyond the toolbar to provide the desired span across which the row units are arranged. These wings are typically connected to the frame or toolbar through a pivot and can be rotated to collapse the wings against the frame to provide the reduced profile. However, to provide for a full range of wing motion between the extended and collapsed positions, the hoses must have a large amount of excess length.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a system and method for seed delivery that does not require the hoses to take sharp turns. Furthermore, it would be advantageous to have a system and method for an adjustable seed delivery system that does not require a significant amount of excess hose length to facilitate a full range of motion.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks by providing a seed distribution system having the seed reservoirs located centrally and routing the seed delivery hoses so as to substantially reduce the creation of sharp turns in the seed delivery hose system. This system increases seed delivery efficiency, reduces the number of parts required for the seed distribution machine, reduces the complexity of the seed distribution machine, and improves the appearance of hose routing in the seed distribution machine. Furthermore, the system directs hoses from one seed reservoir located on one side of a central frame to row units located on the opposite side of the frame. Accordingly, the amount of hose needed to permit a full range of motion between a distribution position and a transportation position is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a seed distribution system is disclosed. The seed distribution system is configured to be transported by an agricultural vehicle along a direction of travel and includes a main frame extending along the direction of travel, a first wing frame extending from a first side of the main frame in a first direction that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel, and a second wing frame extending from a second side of the main frame in a second direction that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel. The system further includes at least one row unit arranged on the first side of the main frame and supported by the first wing frame, at least one row unit arranged on the second side of the main frame and supported by the second wing frame, a first seed reservoir arranged on the first side of the main frame, and a second seed reservoir arranged on the second side of the main frame. A first seed delivery hose assembly system connects the first seed reservoir to the at least one row unit arranged on the second side of the main frame, and a second seed delivery hose assembly system connects the second seed reservoir to the at least one row unit arranged on the first side of the main frame.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, the seed distribution system may include a plurality of row units arranged on the first side of the main frame and supported by the first wing frame and a plurality of row units arranged on the second side of the main frame and supported by the second wing frame.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first seed delivery hose assembly system may also include a plurality of seed delivery hoses connected to only deliver seeds to the plurality of row units arranged on the second side of the main frame, and the second seed delivery hose assembly system may include a plurality of seed delivery hoses connected to only deliver seeds to the plurality of row units arranged on the first side of the main frame.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The seed distribution system may further include a first main toolbar pivot point that connects the first wing frame to the first side of the main frame and a second main toolbar pivot point that connects the second wing frame to the second side of the main frame to form respective pivot axes. The pivot axes allow the first and second wing frames to rotate between a transport position in which the wing frames are substantially parallel to the main frame and a seed distribution position in which the wing frames are substantially perpendicular to the main frame.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, the seed distribution system may include a first metering system to control the delivery of seeds from the first seed reservoir to the at least one row unit arranged on the second side of the main frame and a second metering system to control the delivery of seeds from the second seed reservoir to the at least one row unit arranged on the first side of the main frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The seed distribution system may further include a pneumatic distribution system connected to the first and second seed delivery hose assembly systems to direct the seeds from the first and second seed reservoirs to the row units.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, the first and second seed reservoirs and the pneumatic distribution system may be located ahead of the main toolbar pivot points.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, one seed delivery hose assembly may include a plurality of hoses routed by the main pivot points of the toolbar in order for the seed delivery hoses to be substantially free of sharp turns.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a seed distribution system (or planter) <b>10</b> includes a central frame <b>11</b> extending along a direction of travel indicated by arrow A. The seed distribution system <b>10</b> also includes a laterally extending toolbar <b>12</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which extends transversely to the direction of travel and is connected to the central frame <b>11</b>. A tow bar connector <b>16</b> is disposed at the longitudinally forward end of the central frame <b>11</b> opposite the toolbar <b>12</b> and is configured to mate with a corresponding hitch, or the like, of a towing tractor or similar agricultural vehicle (not shown). In the illustrated embodiment, the tow bar <b>16</b> and the frame <b>11</b> extend along a longitudinal centerline of the seed distribution system <b>10</b> substantially perpendicular to the toolbar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> extend transversely outward and substantially perpendicular to the central frame <b>11</b> when the seed distribution system <b>10</b> is in an extended or seed distribution position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are coupled to the central main frame <b>11</b> by left and right links <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the left wing frame <b>18</b> is pivotally coupled to the central frame <b>11</b> about vertical main pivot axis <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and the right wing frame <b>20</b> is pivotally coupled to the central frame <b>11</b> about vertical main pivot axis <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Therefore, the left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can be rotated about the left and right axes <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> through the links <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. As will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this arrangement enables the wings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to move between the seed distribution or extended position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and a transport position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As will be described, the transverse ends of the wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are provided with left and right hooks <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> for attaching to the tow bar connector <b>16</b> when the seed distribution system <b>10</b> is in transport position.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The toolbar <b>12</b> is supported on the ground by two pairs of inner wheels <b>32</b> disposed on opposite sides of the central frame <b>11</b>. The left wing frame <b>18</b> is supported by left outer wheels <b>34</b>, which are disposed proximate to an outer end <b>36</b> of the left wing frame <b>18</b>. Similarly, the right wing frame <b>20</b> is supported by right outer wheels <b>38</b>, which are disposed proximate to an outer end <b>40</b> of the right wing frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A plurality of seed planting units (or row units) <b>42</b> is arranged longitudinally along the left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> when the seed distribution system <b>10</b> is in its seed distribution position. As is well known in the art, the row units <b>42</b> are mounted in a side-by-side (lateral) relation relative to each other along the left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and, in some cases, across the toolbar <b>12</b> as well. The row units <b>42</b> are shown to be approximately equally spaced, with half of the row units <b>42</b> arranged left of the central frame <b>11</b> and the other half of the row units <b>42</b> arranged right of the central frame <b>11</b>. Left and right main seed reservoirs <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are mounted to the central frame <b>11</b> ahead of the left and right vertical main pivot points <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During operation, the seed distribution system <b>10</b> travels along the ground upon the plurality of wheels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>38</b>, and is towed by an agricultural vehicle such as a tractor (not shown). Forward movement of the tractor causes the row units <b>42</b> to ride along the ground and distribute seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an air pump <b>48</b> directs a pressurized air stream to left and right manifold assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The air pump <b>48</b> may be driven by an electric motor, a hydraulic motor, or any other suitable driving system. The air pump <b>48</b> directs the pressurized air stream to the left and right manifold assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> through a main air hose <b>54</b>. The left manifold assembly <b>50</b> has a plurality of manifold outlets <b>56</b> corresponding to the number of row units <b>42</b> mounted to the right wing frame <b>20</b>. The right manifold assembly <b>52</b> has a plurality of manifold outlets <b>58</b> corresponding to the number of row units <b>42</b> mounted to the left wing frame <b>18</b>. As will be described, seeds located in the seed reservoirs <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are gravity fed to the manifold assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Left and right seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are connected to the respective manifold assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> include a plurality of seed delivery hoses that are coupled together in bundles, generally designated <b>61</b>. The left seed delivery hose assembly system <b>60</b> extends transversely from the left manifold outlets <b>56</b> across the central frame <b>11</b> and directs air and entrained seeds to the individual metering systems on the row units <b>42</b> mounted on the right wing frame <b>20</b>. To this end, in operation, the left seed delivery hose assembly system <b>60</b> is configured so that seeds from the left main seed reservoir <b>44</b> are delivered to the row units <b>42</b> mounted on the right wing frame <b>20</b>. Conversely, the right seed delivery hose assembly system <b>62</b> extends transversely from the right manifold outlets <b>58</b> across the central frame <b>11</b> and directs air and entrained seeds to the individual metering systems on the row units <b>42</b> located on the left wing frame <b>18</b>. Accordingly, in operation, the right seed delivery hose assembly system <b>62</b> is configured so that seeds from the right main seed reservoir <b>46</b> are delivered to the row units <b>42</b> mounted on the left wing frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The crisscross configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> whereby the left seed delivery hose assembly system <b>60</b> connects the left seed reservoir <b>44</b> to the row units <b>42</b> mounted on the right wing frame <b>20</b> and the right seed delivery hose assembly system <b>62</b> connects the right seed reservoir <b>46</b> to the row units <b>42</b> mounted on the left wing frame <b>18</b> substantially increases the efficiency of the seed distribution system <b>10</b>. In the illustrated configuration, the seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> extend out from the manifold outlets <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> toward the main frame <b>11</b> and substantially perpendicular to the main frame <b>11</b>, and then gradually arc toward the row units <b>42</b>. It is contemplated that this arrangement may be modified, for example, such that the seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> extend away from the main frame <b>11</b> at an angle of greater or less than 90 degrees. For example, it is contemplated that an angle of 45 degrees may be desirable in some configuration, such as when using a 30 or 40 foot wing span, as opposed to a 60 foot wing span.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In any case, this arrangement initially creates a substantially straight path in the seed delivery hoses <b>61</b>, which reduces binding, kinking, and resistance to the seed flow. After crossing the main frame <b>11</b>, the individual seed delivery hoses <b>61</b> begin to arc toward the row units <b>42</b>. This path is still substantially free from sharp turns thereby allowing the seed to flow freely from the left and right seed reservoirs <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> to the row units <b>42</b>. This configuration of the seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> is also beneficial because it reduces the length of hose <b>61</b> required to extend from the manifold outlets <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> to the row units <b>42</b>, as will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the seed delivery system <b>10</b> is in its transport position. The left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can be rotated about the left and right pivot axes <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> through the links <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. In order to move the seed delivery system <b>10</b> from the extended, seed distribution position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the collapsed, transport position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> rotate about the left and right pivot axes <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> following an arc B. The left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> rotate forward until substantially parallel to the central frame <b>11</b>. The transverse ends <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> of the wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are provided with left and right hooks <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> for attaching to the tow bar connector <b>16</b>, thus securing the seed delivery system <b>10</b> in transport position. In the transport position, the inner wheels <b>32</b> extending from the toolbar <b>12</b> are the only wheels in contact with the ground. That is, the left and right outer wheels <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> are lifted with the left and right wing frames <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the left and right wing frames <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> travel along the arc B, the row units <b>42</b> maintain a substantially fixed distance from the left and right seed reservoirs <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. Due to the centralized location of the left and right seed reservoirs <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and the strategic configuration of the left and right manifold outlets <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in which the seed delivery hose assembly systems <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> extend toward the central frame <b>11</b>, very little excess hose length is required to transfer the seed distribution system <b>10</b> from the extended, seed distribution position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the collapsed, transport position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. By using the shortest length of hose possible in the left and right seed hose delivery assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, manufacturing costs decrease, the opportunity to damage the individual hoses <b>61</b> decreases, and the overall aesthetic appearance of the seed distribution system <b>10</b> is improved in both the seed distribution position and the transport position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above has been described as a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It will occur to those that practice the art that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
