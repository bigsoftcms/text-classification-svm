<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A surgical instrument includes an E-beam firing bar engages the channel and selectively engages the anvil during distal firing movements, wherein the tissue is severed and stapled driven upward from the staple cartridge to form against the anvil. In particular, a wedge integral to the staple cartridge is driven distally by a middle pin of the firing bar to effect stapling. A single lockout of the staple channel responds to the presence of the wedge sled in its unfired position to allow the firing bar to fire. Otherwise, the single lockout prevents firing when the staple cartridge is missing or spent. Further, some versions include an Electroactive Polymer (EAP) actuator that presents an abutting surface, or acts as a trapdoor to a ramped recess in a staple channel to block the firing bar, as an active approach to preventing firing for one or more conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to surgical stapler instruments that are capable of applying lines of staples to tissue while cutting the tissue between those staple lines and, more particularly, to improvements relating to stapler instruments and improvements in processes for forming various components of such stapler instruments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical staplers have been used in the prior art to simultaneously make a longitudinal incision in tissue and apply lines of staples on opposing sides of the incision. Such instruments commonly include a pair of cooperating jaw members that, if the instrument is intended for endoscopic or laparoscopic applications, are capable of passing through a cannula passageway. One of the jaw members receives a staple cartridge having at least two laterally spaced rows of staples. The other jaw member defines an anvil having staple-forming pockets aligned with the rows of staples in the cartridge. The instrument includes a plurality of reciprocating wedges which, when driven distally, pass through openings in the staple cartridge and engage drivers supporting the staples to effect the firing of the staples toward the anvil.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of a surgical stapler suitable for endoscopic applications is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,895, which advantageously provides distinct closing and firing actions. Thereby, a clinician is able to close the jaw members upon tissue to position the tissue prior to firing. Once the clinician has determined that the jaw members are properly gripping tissue, the clinician can then fire the surgical stapler, thereby severing and stapling the tissue. The simultaneous severing and stapling avoids complications that may arise when performing such actions sequentially with different surgical tools that respectively only sever or staple.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is often advantageous to build an end effector for the surgical stapler that is reusable. For instance, one patient may need a series of severing and stapling operations. Replacing an entire end effector for each operation tends to be economically inefficient. This is especially true if the end effector is built to be strong and reliable over repeated operations. To that end, staple cartridges are fitted into the end effector prior to each operation of the surgical stapler. Thus, a much smaller amount of the surgical staples is discarded after each use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the staple cartridge provides numerous advantages, it is desirable to prevent inadvertent firing of the surgical stapler when an unfired staple cartridge is not present. Otherwise, the severing of tissue may occur without the staples to minimize bleeding. It is particularly desirable that preventing such inadvertent firing be accomplished in a reliable way that is not subject to an intervening malfunction. Moreover, for ease of manufacturing and assembly, it is further desirable that the lockout features be accomplished with a minimum number of components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,202,914 to Geiste, a locking mechanism is disclosed that includes a firing bar (&#x201c;actuation channel&#x201d;) and includes a pair of integral cam wedges that actuate a staple cartridge. An inverted T-shaped member rides under and between the cam wedges to prevent a hook from catching an edge of the firing bar. Once advanced distally, the inverted T-shaped member remains as the firing bar is retracted and thus would be locked out if advanced a second time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While such a lockout mechanism provides certain advantages, it is desirable to incorporate a lockout into a surgical severing and stapling mechanism that operates within an E-beam firing bar that has advantages of its own. In particular, the E-beam engages the lower jaw (staple channel) and the upper jaw (anvil) during firing, assisting in a consistent spacing of jaws. It would be further desirable to have a lockout mechanism that may be remotely controlled so that additional lockout conditions may be incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Consequently, a significant need exists for an improved surgical stapling and severing instrument that prevents inadvertent firing (i.e., severing and stapling) when a staple cartridge is not installed or is spent, having been previously fired.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior art by providing a single lockout mechanism that prevents firing a surgical stapling and severing instrument when either a staple cartridge is not installed or is spent. In particular, the single lock mechanism prevents distal movement of a firing bar, and thus severing of tissue, in instances where simultaneous stapling would not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument includes a handle portion operable to produce a firing motion that actuates an implement portion. A lockout member is positioned within the implement portion to block this firing motion. An electroactive polymer (EAP) actuator may be selectively energized from the handle portion or other remote location to move the lockout member out of an obstructing position, allowing firing. Thereby, a lockout mechanism may be responsive to a range of conditions to prevent an inadvertent firing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument that includes upper and lower jaws for clamping, severing and stapling tissue by receiving a firing bar advantageously includes a lockout device positioned within the implement portion to block this firing motion when conditions requisite to firing are not present. Thereby, inadvertent severing is prevented when effective stapling is not assured.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict a surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> that is capable of practicing the unique benefits of the present invention. The surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> incorporates an end effector <b>12</b> having an E-beam firing mechanism (&#x201c;firing bar&#x201d;) <b>14</b> that advantageously controls the spacing of the end effector <b>12</b>. In particular, an staple channel <b>16</b> and a pivotally translatable anvil <b>18</b> are maintained at a spacing that assures effective stapling and severing. Furthermore, firing (i.e., severing and stapling) is prevented from occurring if the instrument is not capable of stapling with a single lockout mechanism, which is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The surgical and stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> includes a handle portion <b>20</b> connected to an implement portion <b>22</b>, the latter further comprising a shaft <b>23</b> distally terminating in the end effector <b>12</b>. The handle portion <b>20</b> includes a pistol grip <b>24</b> toward which a closure trigger <b>26</b> is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping or closing of the anvil <b>18</b> toward the staple channel <b>16</b> of the end effector <b>12</b>. A firing trigger <b>28</b> is farther outboard of the closure trigger <b>26</b> and is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It will be appreciated that the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping a handle of an instrument. Thus, the end effector <b>12</b> is distal with respect to the more proximal handle portion <b>20</b>. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; are used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Closure trigger <b>26</b> is actuated first. Once the clinician is satisfied with the positioning of the end effector <b>12</b>, the clinician may draw back the closure trigger <b>26</b> to its fully closed, locked position proximate to the pistol grip <b>24</b>. The firing trigger <b>28</b> is then actuated. The firing trigger <b>28</b> springedly returns when the clinician removes pressure. A release button <b>30</b>, when depressed on the proximal end of the handle portion <b>20</b>, releases any locked closure trigger <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A closure sleeve <b>32</b> encloses a frame <b>34</b>, which in turn encloses a firing drive member <b>36</b> that is positioned by the firing trigger <b>28</b>. The frame <b>34</b> connects the handle portion <b>20</b> to the end effector <b>12</b>. With the closure sleeve <b>32</b> withdrawn proximally by the closure trigger <b>26</b> as depicted, the anvil <b>18</b> springedly opens, pivoting away from the staple channel <b>16</b> and translating proximally with the closure sleeve <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The staple channel <b>16</b> receives a staple device, depicted as a staple cartridge <b>37</b>, that is responsive to the firing bar <b>14</b> to drive staples into forming contact with the anvil <b>18</b>. It will appreciated that although a readily replaceable staple cartridge <b>37</b> is advantageously described herein, a staple cartridge <b>37</b> consistent with aspects of the present invention may be permanently affixed or integral to the staple channel <b>16</b>, for instance when a larger portion of the end effector <b>12</b> is replaced after each filing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be appreciated that a staple device consistent with applications of the present invention may be integral with the staple channel <b>16</b> rather than being advantageously detachable therefrom.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">E-Beam Firing Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the firing bar <b>14</b> includes three vertically-spaced pins that control the spacing of the end effector <b>12</b> during firing. In particular, an upper pin <b>38</b> is staged to enter an anvil pocket <b>40</b> near the pivot between the anvil <b>18</b> and staple channel <b>16</b>. When fired with the anvil <b>18</b> closed, the upper pin <b>38</b> advances distally within a longitudinal anvil slot <b>42</b> extending distally through anvil <b>18</b>. Any minor upward deflection in the anvil <b>18</b> is overcome by a downward force imparted by the upper pin <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Firing bar <b>14</b> also includes a lower most pin, or firing bar cap, <b>44</b> that upwardly engages a channel slot <b>45</b> in the staple channel <b>16</b>, thereby cooperating with the upper pin <b>38</b> to draw the anvil <b>18</b> and the staple channel <b>16</b> slightly closer together in the event of excess tissue clamped therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The firing bar <b>14</b> advantageously includes a middle pin <b>46</b> that passes through a firing drive slot <b>47</b> formed in a lower surface of the cartridge <b>37</b> and an upward surface of the staple channel <b>16</b>, thereby driving the staples therein as described below. The middle pin <b>46</b>, by sliding against the staple channel <b>16</b>, advantageously resists any tendency for the end effector <b>12</b> to be pinched shut at its distal end. To illustrate an advantage of the middle pin <b>46</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an alternative end effector <b>12</b>&#x2032; that lacks a middle pin on a firing bar <b>14</b>&#x2032;. In this depiction, the end effector <b>12</b>&#x2032; is allowed to pinch shut at its distal end, which tends to impair desired staple formation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, a distally presented cutting edge <b>48</b> between the upper and middle pins <b>38</b>, <b>46</b> on the firing bar <b>14</b> traverses through a proximally presented, vertical slot <b>49</b> in the cartridge <b>37</b> to sever clamped tissue. The affirmative positioning of the firing bar <b>14</b>, with regard to the staple channel <b>16</b> and anvil <b>18</b>, assure that an effective cut is performed.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Cambered Anvil with Selected Cartridge Gap</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The affirmative vertical spacing provided by the E-Beam firing bar <b>14</b> is suitable for the limited size available for endoscopic devices. Moreover, the E-Beam firing bar <b>14</b> enables fabrication of an anvil <b>16</b> with a camber imparting a vertical deflection at its distal end, similar to the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This cambered anvil <b>16</b> advantageously assists in achieving the desired gap in the end effector <b>12</b> even with an anvil <b>16</b> reduced thickness, which is thus more suited to the size limitations of an endoscopic device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The E-Beam firing bar <b>14</b> further enables increased applications, especially in combination with a range of configurations of staple cartridges. For instance, a clinician may select a gray staple cartridge yielding a 0.02 mm tissue gap, a white staple cartridge yielding a 0.04 mm tissue gap, a blue cartridge yielding a 0.06 mm tissue gap, or a green cartridge yielding a 0.10 mm tissue gap. The vertical height of each respective staple cartridge in combination with the length of staples and an integral wedge sled (described in more detail below) predetermines this desired tissue thickness with the anvil <b>18</b> appropriately vertically spaced by the E-Beam firing bar <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Two-Axis Handle</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the handle portion <b>20</b> is comprised of first and second base sections <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, which are molded from a polymeric material such as a glass-filled polycarbonate. The first base section <b>50</b> is provided with a plurality of cylindrical-shaped pins <b>54</b>. The second base section <b>52</b> includes a plurality of extending members <b>56</b>, each having a hexagonal-shaped opening <b>58</b>. The cylindrical-shaped pins <b>54</b> are received within the hexagonal-shaped openings <b>58</b> and are frictionally held therein for maintaining the first and second base sections <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> in assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A rotating knob <b>60</b> has a bore <b>62</b> extending completely through it for engaging and rotating the implement portion <b>22</b> about its longitudinal axis. The rotating knob <b>60</b> includes an inwardly protruding boss <b>64</b> extending along at least a portion of the bore <b>62</b>. The protruding boss <b>64</b> is received within a longitudinal slot <b>66</b> formed at a proximal portion of the closure sleeve <b>32</b> such that rotation of the rotating knob <b>60</b> effects rotation of the closure sleeve <b>32</b>. It will be appreciated that the boss <b>64</b> further extends through frame <b>34</b> and into contact with a portion of the firing drive member <b>36</b> to effect their rotation as well. Thus, the end effector <b>12</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>) rotates with the rotating knob <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A proximal end <b>68</b> of the frame <b>34</b> passes proximally through the rotating knob <b>60</b> and is provided with a circumferential notch <b>70</b> that is engaged by opposing channel securement members <b>72</b> extending respectively from the base sections <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. Only the channel securement member <b>72</b> of the second base section <b>52</b> is shown. The channel securement members <b>72</b> extending from the base sections <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> serve to secure the frame <b>34</b> to the handle portion <b>20</b> such that the frame <b>34</b> does not move longitudinally relative to the handle portion <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The closure trigger <b>26</b> has a handle section <b>74</b>, a gear segment section <b>76</b>, and an intermediate section <b>78</b>. A bore <b>80</b> extends through the intermediate section <b>78</b>. A cylindrical support member <b>82</b> extending from the second base section <b>52</b> passes through the bore <b>80</b> for pivotably mounting the closure trigger <b>26</b> on the handle portion <b>20</b>. A second cylindrical support member <b>83</b> extending from the second base section <b>52</b> passes through a bore <b>81</b> of firing trigger <b>28</b> for pivotally mounting on the handle portion <b>20</b>. A hexagonal opening <b>84</b> is provided in the cylindrical support member <b>83</b> for receiving a securement pin (not shown) extending from the first base section <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A closure yoke <b>86</b> is housed within the handle portion <b>20</b> for reciprocating movement therein and serves to transfer motion from the closure trigger <b>26</b> to the closure sleeve <b>32</b>. Support members <b>88</b> extending from the second base section <b>52</b> and securement member <b>72</b>, which extends through a recess <b>89</b> in the yoke <b>86</b>, support the yoke <b>86</b> within the handle portion <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A proximal end <b>90</b> of the closure sleeve <b>32</b> is provided with a flange <b>92</b> that is snap-fitted into a receiving recess <b>94</b> formed in a distal end <b>96</b> of the yoke <b>86</b>. A proximal end <b>98</b> of the yoke <b>86</b> has a gear rack <b>100</b> that is engaged by the gear segment section <b>76</b> of the closure trigger <b>26</b>. When the closure trigger <b>26</b> is moved toward the pistol grip <b>24</b> of the handle portion <b>20</b>, the yoke <b>86</b> and, hence, the closure sleeve <b>32</b> move distally, compressing a spring <b>102</b> that biases the yoke <b>86</b> proximally. Distal movement of the closure sleeve <b>32</b> effects pivotal translation movement of the anvil <b>18</b> distally and toward the staple channel <b>16</b> of the end effector <b>12</b> and proximal movement effects closing, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The closure trigger <b>26</b> is forward biased to an open position by a front surface <b>130</b> interacting with an engaging surface <b>128</b> of the firing trigger <b>28</b>. Clamp first hook <b>104</b> that pivots top to rear in the handle portion <b>20</b> about a pin <b>106</b> restrains movement of the firing trigger <b>28</b> toward the pistol grip <b>24</b> until the closure trigger <b>26</b> is clamped to its closed position. Hook <b>104</b> restrains firing trigger <b>28</b> motion by engaging a lockout pin <b>107</b> in firing trigger <b>28</b>. The hook <b>104</b> is also in contact with the closure trigger <b>26</b>. In particular, a forward projection <b>108</b> of the hook <b>104</b> engages a member <b>110</b> on the intermediate section <b>78</b> of the closure trigger <b>26</b>, the member <b>110</b> being outward of the bore <b>80</b> toward the handle section <b>74</b>. Hook <b>104</b> is biased toward contact with member <b>110</b> of the closure trigger <b>26</b> and engagement with lockout pin <b>107</b> in firing trigger <b>28</b> by a release spring <b>112</b>. As the closure trigger <b>26</b> is depressed, the hook <b>104</b> is moved top to rear, compressing the release spring <b>112</b> that is captured between a rearward projection <b>114</b> on the hook <b>104</b> and a forward projection <b>116</b> on the release button <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As the yoke <b>86</b> moves distally in response to proximal movement of the closure trigger <b>26</b>, an upper latch arm <b>118</b> of the release button <b>30</b> moves along an upper surface <b>120</b> on the yoke <b>86</b> until dropping into an upwardly presented recess <b>122</b> in a proximal, lower portion of the yoke <b>86</b>. The release spring <b>112</b> urges the release button <b>30</b> outward, which pivots the upper latch arm <b>118</b> downwardly into engagement with the upwardly presented recess <b>122</b>, thereby locking the closure trigger <b>26</b> in a tissue clamping position, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The latch arm <b>118</b> can be moved out of the recess <b>122</b> to release the anvil <b>18</b> by pushing the release button <b>30</b> inward. Specifically, the upper latch arm <b>118</b> pivots upward about pin <b>123</b> of the second base section <b>52</b>. The yoke <b>86</b> is then permitted to move proximally in response to return movement of the closure trigger <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A firing trigger return spring <b>124</b> is located within the handle portion <b>20</b> with one end attached to pin <b>106</b> of the second base section <b>52</b> and the other end attached to a pin <b>126</b> on the firing trigger <b>28</b>. The firing return spring <b>124</b> applies a return force to the pin <b>126</b> for biasing the firing trigger <b>28</b> in a direction away from the pistol grip <b>24</b> of the handle portion <b>20</b>. The closure trigger <b>26</b> is also biased away from pistol grip <b>24</b> by engaging surface <b>128</b> of firing trigger <b>28</b>, biasing front surface <b>130</b> of closure trigger <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the closure trigger <b>26</b> is moved toward the pistol grip <b>24</b>, its front surface <b>130</b> engages with the engaging surface <b>128</b> on the firing trigger <b>28</b>, causing the firing trigger <b>28</b> to move to its &#x201c;firing&#x201d; position. When in its firing position, the firing trigger <b>28</b> is located at an angle of approximately 45&#xb0; to the pistol grip <b>24</b>. After staple firing, the spring <b>124</b> causes the firing trigger <b>28</b> to return to its initial position. During the return movement of the firing trigger <b>28</b>, its engaging surface <b>128</b> pushes against the front surface <b>130</b> of the closure trigger <b>26</b> causing the closure trigger <b>26</b> to return to its initial position. A stop member <b>132</b> extends from the second base section <b>52</b> to prevent the closure trigger <b>26</b> from rotating beyond its initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> additionally includes a reciprocating section <b>134</b>, a multiplier <b>136</b> and a drive member <b>138</b>. The reciprocating section <b>134</b> comprises a wedge sled in the implement portion <b>22</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6-9</figref>) and a metal drive rod <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The drive member <b>138</b> includes first and second gear racks <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. A first notch <b>144</b> is provided on the drive member <b>138</b> intermediate the first and second gear racks <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>. During return movement of the firing trigger <b>28</b>, a tooth <b>146</b> on the firing trigger <b>28</b> engages with the first notch <b>144</b> for returning the drive member <b>138</b> to its initial position after staple firing. A second notch <b>148</b> is located at a proximal end of the metal drive rod <b>140</b> for locking the metal drive rod <b>140</b> to the upper latch arm <b>118</b> of the release button <b>30</b> in its unfired position.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The multiplier <b>136</b> comprises first and second integral pinion gears <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>. The first integral pinion gear <b>150</b> is engaged with a first gear rack <b>154</b> provided on the metal drive rod <b>140</b>. The second integral pinion gear <b>152</b> is engaged with the first gear rack <b>141</b> on the drive member <b>138</b>. The first integral pinion gear <b>150</b> has a first diameter and the second integral pinion gear <b>152</b> has a second diameter which is smaller than the first diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> depict respectively the handle portion <b>20</b> in the start position (open and unfired), a clamped position (closed and unfired) and a fired position. The firing trigger <b>28</b> is provided with a gear segment section <b>156</b>. The gear segment section <b>156</b> engages with the second gear rack <b>142</b> on the drive member <b>138</b> such that motion of the firing trigger <b>28</b> causes the drive member <b>138</b> to move back and forth between a first drive position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and a second drive position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In order to prevent staple firing before tissue clamping has occurred, the upper latch arm <b>118</b> on the release button <b>30</b> is engaged with the second notch <b>148</b> on the drive member <b>138</b> such that the metal drive rod <b>140</b> is locked in its proximal-most position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the upper latch arm <b>118</b> falls into the recess <b>122</b>, the upper latch arm <b>118</b> disengages with the second notch <b>148</b> to permit distal movement of the metal drive rod <b>140</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Because the first gear rack <b>141</b> on the drive member <b>138</b> and the gear rack <b>154</b> on the metal drive rod <b>140</b> are engaged with the multiplier <b>136</b>, movement of the firing trigger <b>28</b> causes the metal drive rod <b>140</b> to reciprocate between a first reciprocating position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and a second reciprocating position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Since the diameter of the first pinion gear <b>150</b> is greater than the diameter of the second pinion gear <b>152</b>, the multiplier <b>136</b> moves the reciprocating section <b>134</b> a greater distance than the drive member <b>138</b> is moved by the firing trigger <b>28</b>. The diameters of the first and second pinion gears <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> may be changed to permit the length of the stroke of the firing trigger <b>28</b> and the force required to move it to be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It will be appreciated that the handle portion <b>20</b> is illustrative and that other actuation mechanisms may be employed. For instance, the closing and firing motions may be generated by automated means.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Separate and Distinct Closing and Firing End Effector</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The end effector <b>12</b> of the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> is depicted in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-16</figref>. As described above, the handle portion <b>20</b> produces separate and distinct closing and firing motions that actuate the end effector <b>12</b>. The end effector <b>12</b> advantageously maintains the clinical flexibility of this separate and distinct closing and firing (i.e., stapling and severing). In addition, the end effector <b>12</b> introduces the aforementioned ability to affirmatively maintain the closed spacing during firing after the clinician positions and clamps the tissue. Both features procedurally and structurally enhance the ability of the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> by ensuring adequate spacing for instances where an otherwise inadequate amount of tissue is clamped and to enhance the clamping in instances where an otherwise excessive amount of tissue has been clamped.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts the end effector <b>12</b>, which is in an open position by a retracted closure sleeve <b>32</b>, with a staple cartridge <b>37</b> installed in the staple channel <b>16</b>.

The firing bar <b>14</b> is at its proximal position, with the upper pin <b>38</b> aligned in a noninterfering fashion with the anvil pocket <b>40</b>. The anvil pocket <b>40</b> is shown as communicating with the longitudinal anvil slot <b>42</b> in the anvil <b>18</b>. The distally presented cutting edge <b>48</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> is aligned with and proximally removed from the vertical slot <b>49</b> in the staple cartridge <b>37</b>, thereby allowing removal of a spent cartridge <b>37</b> and insertion of an unfired cartridge <b>37</b>, which is snapfit into the staple channel <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the implement portion <b>22</b> of the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> in disassembled form.

When assembled, the cartridge tray <b>224</b> holds the wedge sled <b>218</b>, single and double drivers <b>220</b>, and staples <b>222</b> inside the cartridge body <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Having a wedge sled <b>218</b> integral to the staple cartridge <b>37</b> enables a number of flexible design options as compared to incorporating camming surfaces onto a firing bar itself. For instance, a number of different staple cartridges may be selected for use in the instrument <b>10</b> with each staple cartridge having a different configuration of rows of staples, each thus having a unique wedge sled configured to contact the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> while causing the driving of the staples <b>222</b>. As another example, the integral wedge sled <b>218</b> provides an opportunity for a number of lockout features, described in greater detail in the first and third aforementioned co-pending applications.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The staple channel <b>16</b> has a proximally placed attachment cavity <b>226</b> that receives a channel anchoring member <b>228</b> on the distal end of the frame <b>34</b> for attaching the end effector <b>12</b> to the handle portion <b>20</b>. The staple channel <b>16</b> also has an anvil cam slot <b>230</b> that pivotally receives an anvil pivot <b>232</b> of the anvil <b>18</b>. The closure sleeve <b>32</b> that encompasses the frame <b>34</b> includes a distally presented tab <b>234</b> that engages an anvil feature <b>236</b> proximate but distal to the anvil pivot <b>232</b> on the anvil <b>18</b> to thereby effect opening and closing of the anvil <b>18</b>. The firing drive member <b>36</b> is shown as being assembled from the firing bar <b>14</b> attached to a firing connector <b>238</b> by pins <b>240</b>, which in turn is rotatingly and proximally attached to the metal drive rod <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a portion of the staple cartridge <b>37</b> is removed to expose portions of the staple channel <b>16</b>, such as recesses <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and to expose some components of the staple cartridge <b>37</b> in their unfired position. In particular, the cartridge body <b>216</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) has been removed. The wedge sled <b>218</b> is shown at its proximal, unfired position with a pusher block <b>242</b> contacting the middle pin <b>46</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) of the firing bar <b>14</b>. The wedge sled <b>218</b> is in longitudinal sliding contact upon the cartridge tray <b>224</b> and includes wedges <b>228</b> that force upward the single and double drivers <b>220</b> as the wedge sled <b>218</b> moves distally. Staples <b>222</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) resting upon the drivers <b>220</b> are thus also forced upward into contact with the anvil forming pockets <b>202</b> on the anvil <b>18</b> to form closed staples.

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Operation.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In use, the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> is used as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>17</b>-<b>23</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the instrument <b>10</b> is in its start position, having had an unfired, fully loaded staple cartridge <b>37</b> snap-fitted into the distal end of the staple channel <b>16</b>. Both triggers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are forward and the end effector <b>12</b> is open, such as would be typical after inserting the end effector <b>12</b> through a trocar or other opening into a body cavity. The instrument <b>10</b> is then manipulated by the clinician such that tissue <b>248</b> to be stapled and severed is positioned between the staple cartridge <b>37</b> and the anvil <b>18</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref>, next, the clinician moves the closure trigger <b>26</b> proximally until positioned directly adjacent to the pistol grip <b>24</b>, locking the handle portion <b>20</b> into the closed and clamped position. The retracted firing bar <b>14</b> in the end effector <b>12</b> does not impede the selective opening and closing of the end effector <b>12</b>, but rather resides within the anvil pocket <b>40</b>. With the anvil <b>18</b> closed and clamped, the E-beam firing bar <b>14</b> is aligned for firing through the end effector <b>12</b>. In particular, the upper pin <b>38</b> is aligned with the anvil slot <b>42</b> and the staple channel <b>16</b> affirmatively engaged about the channel slot <b>45</b> by the middle pin <b>46</b> and the firing bar cap <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>, after tissue clamping has occurred, the clinician moves the firing trigger <b>28</b> proximally causing the firing bar <b>14</b> to move distally into the end effector <b>12</b>. In particular, the middle pin <b>46</b> enters the staple cartridge <b>37</b> through the firing drive slot <b>47</b> to effect the firing of the staples <b>222</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>) via wedge sled <b>218</b> toward the anvil <b>18</b>. The lower most pin, or firing bar cap <b>44</b>, cooperates with the middle pin <b>46</b> to slidingly position cutting edge <b>48</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> to sever tissue. The two pins <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> also position the upper pin <b>38</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> within longitudinal anvil slot <b>42</b> of the anvil <b>18</b>, affirmatively maintaining the spacing between the anvil <b>18</b> and the staple channel <b>16</b> throughout its distal firing movement.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-23</figref>, the clinician continues moving the firing trigger <b>28</b> until brought proximal to the closure trigger <b>26</b> and pistol grip <b>24</b>. Thereby, all of the ends of the staples <b>222</b> are bent over as a result of their engagement with the anvil <b>18</b>. The firing bar cap <b>44</b> is arrested against a firing bar stop <b>250</b> projecting toward the distal end of the channel slot <b>45</b>. The cutting edge <b>48</b> has traversed completely through the tissue. The process is completed by releasing the firing trigger <b>28</b> and then depressing the release button <b>30</b> while simultaneously squeezing the closure trigger <b>26</b> to open the end effector <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Single Lockout for Missing/Spent Staple Cartridge</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As described above, the E-beam firing bar <b>14</b> provides unique capabilities for affirmatively spacing the end effector <b>12</b> while simultaneously severing tissue and effecting the forming of staples on each side of the cut. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, preventing the distal movement of the firing bar <b>14</b> thus prevents the inadvertent severing of tissue. A single lockout mechanism <b>270</b> advantageously responds to a missing staple cartridge <b>37</b> or a spent staple cartridge <b>37</b>, the latter condition depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, by blocking the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar (only the middle pin of the firing bar being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In particular, the single lockout mechanism <b>270</b> is depicted as a pair of bent spring fingers <b>272</b> positioned in the staple channel <b>16</b> to respond to both conditions: missing cartridge and spent cartridge. In particular, the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> raise up to block the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> when the wedge sled <b>218</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) is not present, such as when the cartridge <b>37</b> is removed or when the cartridge <b>37</b> has been fired.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-28</figref> depict the single lockout mechanism <b>270</b>, specifically the bent sprint fingers <b>272</b> sequentially as the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>10</b> is fired. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, an unfired staple cartridge <b>37</b> has been inserted into the staple channel <b>16</b> with the wedge sled <b>218</b> depressing the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> so that the firing drive slot <b>47</b> formed between the cartridge <b>37</b> and the staple channel <b>16</b> is unimpeded.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, firing of the cartridge <b>37</b> has commenced, with the wedge sled <b>218</b> and the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> having distally traversed off of the bent spring fingers <b>272</b>, which then spring up into the firing drive slot <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the staple cartridge <b>37</b> is now spent with the wedge sled <b>218</b> fully driven distally and no longer depicted. The firing bar <b>14</b> is being retracted proximally. Since the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> pivot from a more distal point, the firing bar <b>14</b> is able to ride up onto the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> during retraction, causing them to be depressed out of the firing drive slot <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the firing bar <b>14</b> is fully retracted and now confronts a non-depressed pair of bent spring fingers <b>272</b> to prevent distal movement. The single lockout mechanism <b>270</b> thereby remains activated during the period in which the spent staple cartridge <b>37</b> is removed until an unfired staple cartridge <b>37</b> is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> depicts a lockout trough <b>274</b> that may advantageously be included in the single lockout mechanism <b>270</b> in order to provide increased mechanical strength. In some applications, it may be desirable to block strong firing motions without damage to the bent spring fingers <b>272</b>. The lockout trough <b>274</b> communicates with the firing drive slot <b>47</b> when the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> are not depressed. Moreover, the lockout trough <b>274</b> is downwardly ramped in a distal direction such that the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> is directed toward an abutting surface <b>276</b> at a distal end of the lockout trough <b>274</b>, thereby reacting the distal movement of the firing bar <b>14</b> into a staple channel <b>16</b>&#x2032;. In particular, the firing bar <b>14</b> in its initial position moves to a distal and lowered position, depicted at <b>14</b>&#x2032;, wherein the middle pin <b>46</b> moves to a position depicted as <b>46</b>&#x2032;. It will be appreciated that the upper pin <b>38</b> and lower firing bar cap <b>44</b>, as each moves to distal and lowered positions <b>38</b>&#x2032; and <b>44</b>&#x2032; respectively, position the middle pin <b>46</b> against staple channel <b>16</b> so that the middle pin <b>46</b> enters the lockout trough <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It will be further appreciated that the firing bar <b>14</b>&#x2032; may be readily retracted from the lockout trough <b>274</b>. Moreover, insofar as the upper pin <b>38</b>&#x2032; would be engaging the anvil <b>18</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) in this position, the clinician would have to retract the firing bar <b>14</b>&#x2032; so that the anvil <b>18</b> could be opened in order to insert an unfired staple cartridge <b>37</b>, and thus the firing bar <b>14</b> would be fully retracted and would not impede the depressing of the bent spring fingers <b>272</b> to their inactivated position.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> depicts another single lockout mechanism <b>270</b>, depicted as a pair of lockout hooks <b>280</b> having ramped ends <b>282</b> distally placed with regard to attachment devices <b>284</b> inserted through apertures <b>286</b> in the staple channel <b>16</b>. The ramped ends <b>282</b> lie above a hook recess <b>288</b> defined in the staple channel <b>16</b>. Thus, when each ramped end <b>282</b> is contacted by a wedge sled <b>218</b> of an unfired staple cartridge <b>37</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>), the ramped ends <b>282</b> are depressed into the hook recess <b>288</b>, thereby clearing the way for the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> (only the middle pin shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) to move distally to fire the staple cartridge <b>37</b>. A thin shaft <b>290</b> coupling the attachment devices <b>284</b> respectively to the ramped end <b>282</b> of each lockout hook <b>280</b> resiliently responds to the absence of a wedge sled <b>218</b>, as depicted, wherein the ramped ends <b>282</b> return to impede the firing drive slot <b>47</b> to block a retracted middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-34</figref> depict the sequence of operation of the lockout hooks <b>280</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the staple cartridge <b>37</b> is unfired so that the distally positioned wedge sled <b>218</b> depresses the ramped ends <b>282</b> into the hook recess <b>288</b>, allowing the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> to move distally during firing, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. With the wedge sled <b>218</b> and middle pin <b>46</b> distally removed with respect to the lockout mechanism <b>270</b>, the ramped ends <b>282</b> resiliently raise out of the hook recess <b>282</b> to occupy the firing drive slot <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the firing bar <b>14</b> is being retracted to the point of contacting the ramped ends <b>282</b> of the lockout hook <b>280</b>. Since the distal end of the ramped ends <b>282</b> is lower than the proximal part of the ramped ends <b>282</b>, the middle pin <b>46</b> of the firing bar <b>14</b> rides over the ramped ends <b>282</b>, forcing them down into the hook recess <b>288</b> until middle pin <b>46</b> is past the ramped ends <b>282</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, wherein the ramped ends <b>282</b> resiliently spring back up to block the middle pin <b>46</b>. Thus, the firing bar <b>14</b> is prevented from distal movement while the spent staple cartridge <b>37</b> is replaced with an unfired staple cartridge <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Electroactive Polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are a set of conductive doped polymers that change shape when electrical voltage is applied. In essence, the conductive polymer is paired to some form of ionic fluid or gel and electrodes. Flow of the ions from the fluid/gel into or out of the conductive polymer is induced by the voltage potential applied and this flow induces the shape change of the polymer. The voltage potential ranges from 1V to 4 kV, depending on the polymer and ionic fluid used. Some of the EAPs contract when voltage is applied and some expand. The EAPs may be paired to mechanical means such as springs or flexible plates to change the effect that is caused when the voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">There are two basic types of EAPs and multiple configurations of each type. The two basic types are a fiber bundle and a laminate version. The fiber bundle consists of fibers around 30-50 microns. These fibers may be woven into a bundle much like textiles and are often called EAP yarn because of this. This type of EAP contracts when voltage is applied. The electrodes are usually made up of a central wire core and a conductive outer sheath that also serves to contain the ionic fluid that surrounds the fiber bundles. An example of a commercially available fiber EAP material is manufactured by Santa Fe Science and Technology and sold as PANION&#x2122; fiber and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,667,825, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The other type is a laminate structure, which consists of a layer of EAP polymer, a layer of ionic gel and two flexible plates that are attached to either side of the laminate. When a voltage is applied, the square laminate plate expands in one direction and contracts in the perpendicular direction. An example of a commercially available laminate (plate) EAP material is from Artificial Muscle Inc, a division of SRI Laboratories. Plate EAP material is also available from EAMEX of Japan and is referred to as thin film EAP.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It should be noted that EAPs do not change volume when energized; they merely expand or contract in one direction while doing the opposite in the transverse direction. The laminate version may be used in its basic form by containing one side against a rigid structure and using the other much like a piston. The laminate version may also be adhered to either side of a flexible plate. When one side of the flexible plate EAP is energized, it expands flexing the plate in the opposite direction. This allows the plate to be flexed in either direction, depending on which side is energized.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">An EAP actuator usually consists of numerous layers or fibers bundled together to work in cooperation. The mechanical configuration of the EAP determines the EAP actuator and its capabilities for motion. The EAP may be formed into long stands and wrapped around a single central electrode. A flexible exterior outer sleeve will form the other electrode for the actuator as well as contain the ionic fluid necessary for the function of the device. In this configuration when the electrical field is applied to the electrodes, the strands of EAP shorten. This configuration of EAP actuator is called a fiber EAP actuator. Likewise, the laminate configuration may be placed in numerous layers on either side of a flexible plate or merely in layers on itself to increase its capabilities. Typical fiber structures have an effective strain of 2-4% where the typical laminate version achieves 20-30%, utilizing much higher voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For instance, a laminate EAP composite may be formed from a positive plate electrode layer attached to an EAP layer, which in turn is attached to an ionic cell layer, which in turn is attached to a negative plate electrode layer. A plurality of laminate EAP composites may be affixed in a stack by adhesive layers therebetween to form an EAP plate actuator. It should be appreciated that opposing EAP actuators may be formed that can selectively bend in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A contracting EAP fiber actuator may include a longitudinal platinum cathode wire that passes through an insulative polymer proximal end cap through an elongate cylindrical cavity formed within a plastic cylinder wall that is conductively doped to serve as a positive anode. A distal end of the platinum cathode wire is embedded into an insulative polymer distal end cap. A plurality of contracting polymer fibers are arranged parallel with and surrounding the cathode wire and have their ends embedded into respective end caps. The plastic cylinder wall is peripherally attached around respective end caps to enclose the cylindrical cavity to seal in ionic fluid or gel that fills the space between contracting polymer fibers and cathode wire. When a voltage is applied across the plastic cylinder wall (anode) and cathode wire, ionic fluid enters the contracting polymer fibers, causing their outer diameter to swell with a corresponding contraction in length, thereby drawing the end caps toward one another.</p>

The anvil <b>536</b> pivots about proximal anvil pivot pins <b>544</b> that slide within a respective anvil pivot recess <b>546</b> in the staple channel <b>520</b> (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the proximal firing bar <b>528</b> of the E-beam <b>512</b> includes a downward projection <b>548</b> that slides against the staple channel <b>520</b>, advantageously raising the distal E-beam <b>512</b> when retracted, advantageously preparing the staple applying assembly <b>514</b> for insertion through a trocar for instance and staging the middle pins <b>530</b> for entering an EAP acuated lockout mechanism <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-38</figref>, the E-beam <b>512</b> has been distally moved as firing commences. The upper pins <b>532</b> enter a widened anvil track <b>552</b> formed in the anvil <b>536</b> that communicates with the anvil pocket <b>534</b>. A narrowed anvil slot <b>554</b> that vertically communicates with the anvil track <b>552</b> allows passage of a cutting surface <b>556</b> of the E-beam <b>512</b> that severs tissue clamped between the anvil <b>536</b> and a staple cartridge <b>558</b> engaged to the staple channel <b>520</b>. An engagement surface <b>560</b> of the E-beam <b>512</b> between the cutting surface <b>556</b> and middle pins <b>530</b> abuts a wedge sled <b>562</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) that is integral to and initially proximally positioned in the staple cartridge <b>558</b>. It should be appreciated that the wedge sled <b>562</b> cams upwardly staple drivers <b>564</b> and thus staples <b>566</b> that sit onto of the staple drivers <b>564</b> within staple apertures <b>568</b> for forming against the anvil <b>536</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A more distal, heightened portion <b>572</b> of the firing bar <b>528</b> receives a downward urging by a clip spring <b>574</b> engaged to a frame <b>576</b> of an elongate shaft <b>578</b> of an implement portion <b>580</b> of the surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>510</b>. The contact between the clip spring <b>574</b> and the heightened portion <b>572</b> is registered to each other during a first portion of firing travel in correspondence to the downward projection <b>548</b> dropping into the widened hole <b>518</b> and the middle pins <b>530</b> approaching the EAP actuated lockout mechanism <b>550</b>. Thus, the clip spring <b>574</b> assists during this portion of firing travel in driving the middle pin <b>530</b> downward into a ramped recess <b>591</b> formed in the staple channel <b>520</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-38</figref>, the EAP actuated lockout mechanism <b>590</b> includes an EAP vertically-expansive actuator <b>592</b> that receives an electrical excitation signal from a handle portion (not shown) to deactivate the EAP actuated lockout mechanism <b>590</b> to vertically compress to clear the way for one or both of the middle pin <b>530</b> and lower foot <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">EAP Actuated Locking Mechanism with Downward Deflected, Abutting EAP Plate Actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39-40</figref>, a surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>610</b> is identical to that described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-38</figref> above except that an EAP actuated locking mechanism <b>650</b> utilizes a proximally projecting, downwardly actuated EAP plate actuator <b>592</b> that is normally aligned to block a ramped recess <b>691</b> formed in a staple channel <b>620</b> and may be activated to bend downwardly into alignment with the ramped recess <b>691</b> (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> as <b>692</b>&#x2032;). Thus, a proximal end of the EAP plate actuator <b>692</b> presents an abutting surface <b>693</b> to absorb the firing forces from the middle pin <b>530</b>, and thus the E-beam <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">EAP Actuated Locking Mechanism with Downward Deflected Trapdoor EAP Plate Actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40-41</figref>, a surgical stapling and severing instrument <b>710</b> is identical to that described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-38</figref> above except that an EAP actuated locking mechanism <b>750</b> utilizes a proximally projecting, downwardly actuated EAP plate actuator <b>592</b> that is normally aligned as a trapdoor to open a ramped recess <b>791</b> formed in a staple channel <b>720</b> and may be activated to bend downwardly to close the ramped recess <b>791</b> (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> as <b>792</b>&#x2032;) to allow firing. Thus, an abutting surface <b>793</b> at a distal end of the ramped recess absorbs the firing forces from the middle pin <b>530</b> of the E-beam <b>512</b>, preventing firing.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">EAP Actuator Control Circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">It should be appreciated that control circuitry in the handle portion may advantageously respond to or in anticipation of a user's firing command by deactivating an EAP lockout when deemed advisable. For example, a sensed missing staple cartridge, expended staple cartridge, or mis-sized staple cartridge for the end effector may preclude a deactivation signal from reaching the EAP lockout or be sensed and interpreted by control logic in the handle portion. As another example, improperly clamped tissue may be sensed (e.g., pressure transducers spaced along the jaws may sense too much tissue or too little tissue along some portion of the end effector. In addition, for an end effector incorporating buttress material for thin or thick tissue, the presence or absence of buttress material when the contrary is warranted may preclude disengaging the lockout.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">For example, a mechanical single lockout mechanism may comprise a spring-loaded plunger encompassed within the staple channel <b>16</b> that moves upwardly into the firing drive slot <b>47</b> when not contacted by the wedge sled <b>218</b> with the plunger presenting a hooked or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As another example, although EAP actuator control circuitry is described that defaults to a locking condition when unpowered, it should be appreciated that this arrangement is illustrative. Applications consistent with aspects of the invention may default to an unlocked state with energy of one or more EAP actuator to move them to a locking state.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As yet a further example, while a detachable staple cartridge is described in the illustrative version, applications consistent with the present invention may include an interchangeable implement portion wherein the EAP lockout mechanism may be contained, at least partially, in the distal, interchangeable portion. Alternatively, a portion of the firing bar or firing rod proximal to the end effector may include a contacting surface that is selectively blocked by an EAP lockout mechanism proximal to the end effector.</p>
