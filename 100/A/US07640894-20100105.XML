<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to the drawings in detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one possible embodiment of a treat dispenser for animals pursuant to the present application, with the treat dispenser being designated generally by the reference numeral <b>20</b>. The treat dispenser of the present application comprises a hollow housing <b>22</b>, and an insert <b>23</b> that is disposed in the housing <b>22</b>. The housing is in particular in the nature of a chew toy for dogs, and can be made of elastomeric material that is strong and tough enough to withstand the rough play of an animal. Suitable elastomeric materials could include natural rubber or a thermoset rubber, for example SBR rubber having a Shore A hardness of 35-85.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The hollow housing <b>22</b> is provided with an aperture <b>24</b> that is adapted to receive treats into the hollow interior of the housing, and to dispense treats therefrom. It should be noted that the aperture <b>24</b> is not intended to hold treats in place, but rather to allow them to pass into and out of the housing <b>22</b>. The aperture <b>24</b> also enables introduction of the insert <b>23</b> into the interior of the housing <b>22</b> when the insert is a separate component. In particular, the housing can be stretched by up to 300%, whereupon the insert <b>23</b> can easily be introduced through the aperture <b>24</b> into the interior of the housing <b>22</b>. Although only one aperture <b>24</b> is shown, it would also be possible to provide more than one aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The insert <b>23</b> serves for advancing treats toward or away from the aperture <b>24</b>, depending upon the direction in which the treat dispenser rotates, as will be discussed in detail subsequently. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the insert <b>23</b> is in the form of a true helix, as can be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows the insert <b>23</b> by itself. The insert <b>23</b> can be made, for example, of a polyamide resin, such as nylon, ABS resins, elastomeric material, thermoplastic material, composites, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the insert <b>23</b> is shown as conforming somewhat to the inner contour of the housing <b>22</b>, this is not absolutely necessary, so that the insert <b>23</b> could be disposed somewhat loosely in the housing <b>22</b>, which would make the housing more flexible. The important thing is that the insert <b>23</b> not be able to tilt to any significant amount, for example not more than 30&#xb0;, in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>26</b> of the insert <b>23</b>. In this connection, the height to width ratio of the insert is preferably greater than 1. However, the insert <b>23</b> need not be prevented from rotating about the axis <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The insert <b>23</b> essentially operates on the principle of an Archimedes or endless screw, wherein upon rotation of the insert <b>23</b>, either on its own or together with the housing <b>22</b>, treats or other material contained in the housing would travel along the broad threads of the insert <b>23</b> in one direction or the other. For example, if the toy or treat dispenser <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is rolled in a direction having a first directional component indicated by the arrow <b>28</b> that is perpendicular to the central axis <b>26</b> of the insert <b>23</b>, treats contained within the housing <b>22</b> will move along the threads of the insert <b>23</b> in a direction toward the aperture <b>24</b>, where they can be dispensed, in particular one at a time. However, if the toy is rolled in a direction having a directional component that is opposite to that indicated by the arrow <b>28</b>, then the treats will move along the threads of the insert <b>23</b> in a direction away from the aperture <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the insert <b>23</b> has been illustrated as forming a circular or conically open central portion when viewed from one end, for example from the direction of the aperture <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, by appropriately shaping the inner surfaces of the threads of the insert <b>23</b>, the central portion could also be open only partially, or not be open at all, again when viewed from one end. In other words, when viewed in the direction of the central axis <b>26</b>, the inner surfaces could be spaced by any desired distance from the axis <b>26</b>. It should also be noted that where an open central portion is provided, the opening thereof is generally small enough to prevent treats from dropping straight through when the treat dispenser is disposed in such a way that the insert <b>23</b> is vertically oriented. Furthermore, the open central cross-section of the insert <b>23</b> is symmetrical or assymetrical relative to the central longitudinal axis <b>26</b> of the insert <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The metering or dispensing rate of treats from the treat dispenser <b>20</b>, i.e. from the aperture <b>24</b> of the housing <b>22</b>, can be affected in several different ways. For example, the number of flights or threads of the insert <b>23</b> can vary (by way of example, compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). In addition, the pitch of the threads can vary from one end of the insert <b>23</b> to the other. For example, the angle of the threads can become smaller or flatter in the direction toward the aperture <b>24</b>, which would cause the treats to back up somewhat within the housing <b>22</b>. The size of the open central portion of the insert <b>23</b> can also be varied. The size of the treats inserted into the interior of the housing <b>22</b> will also affect the feed or dispensing rate thereof. It is generally desirable that the treats not be dispensed too rapidly, although at a rate that is sufficient to hold the interest of an animal playing with the treat dispenser <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the housing <b>22</b> is also provided with a breathing hole <b>30</b> that is disposed diametrically opposite from the location of the aperture <b>24</b>. Thus, if an animal has its mouth entirely over either the aperture <b>24</b> or the hole <b>30</b>, the animal can still breathe due to the presence of the other hole or aperture that is not covered. It should be noted that the additional, optional breathing hole <b>30</b> is of a size such that it cannot receive nor dispense treats.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the housing <b>22</b> can be provided with an optional, reinforcing rib <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of an insert <b>23</b> for the treat dispenser <b>20</b> of the present application. In this embodiment, the insert <b>23</b> is characterized as having a stairstepped design or configuration, thus deviating from a true helix. In particular, the insert <b>23</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has inclined sections <b>34</b> that lead to or from platform sections <b>35</b>, which serve to divide the interior of the housing <b>22</b> into multiple chambers for the temporary retention of treats or other material. The platform sections <b>35</b> also serve to retard the dispensing or release rate of treats from the interior of the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the embodiment of the insert <b>23</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, not only do the number of flights or threads of the insert differ from the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but in addition rather than the portions that are disposed between the platform sections <b>35</b> always being inclined relative to the platform sections, some of the platform sections <b>35</b> can be interconnected by a thread portion <b>36</b> that is disposed in the same plane as are the two platform sections <b>35</b> that are interconnected (see also the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some of the many possible variations for the designs of the inserts <b>23</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another exemplary embodiment of a treat dispenser <b>20</b> having a modified insert <b>23</b> disposed in the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows one of many different configurations that are possible for the housing <b>22</b>, as well as a modified insert <b>23</b> having an open central portion with a circular cross-section when viewed from either the aperture <b>24</b> or the hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show another configuration for the housing <b>22</b>, one time with an insert <b>23</b> in the form of a helix (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and another time with an insert <b>23</b> having a modified stairstepped design (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). These embodiments of treat dispensers <b>20</b> also show different configurations for the open central portions of the inserts <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the insert <b>23</b> has been shown and described as a separate component, it could also be monolithic with the housing <b>22</b>, for example being molded in one piece with the housing. In this connection, the housing and insert could be molded or otherwise formed together in two or more parts that are then glued, fused, welded, or otherwise connected together to form a treat dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be noted that the treat dispenser <b>20</b> of the present application is easy to clean. For example, a hose can be used to spray water into the housing <b>22</b> via the aperture <b>24</b> or the hole <b>30</b>. In addition, if the insert <b>23</b> has an open central portion, a brush, such as a bottle brush, can be inserted therein to facilitate cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention is, of course, in no way restricted to the specific disclosure of the specification and drawings, but also encompasses any modifications within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
