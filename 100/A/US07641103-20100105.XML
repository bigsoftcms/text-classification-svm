<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is side view of the improved log chute <b>2</b> in the second position <b>22</b>. In this position the log chute <b>2</b> is easily unloaded. The building <b>14</b> has an opening <b>38</b> through the wall <b>12</b> that contains a wall mounted frame <b>8</b>. The wall mounted frame <b>8</b> retains the log chute <b>2</b>. The log chute <b>2</b> allows the user the ability to load fire wood <b>10</b> from an outside location then move inside and manipulate the log chute <b>2</b> to its second position <b>22</b> for unloading within the building <b>14</b>. The log chute <b>2</b> has a near end <b>16</b> and a distal end <b>18</b>. The log chute <b>2</b> has a first side <b>4</b> and a second side <b>6</b>. When the log chute <b>2</b> is in the loading position <b>20</b> the first side <b>4</b> or exterior side allows wood to be loaded within in the log chute <b>2</b>. Accordingly the opposite is true for unloading. Also present is an air curtain <b>100</b> that is removably attached by way of Velcro <b>102</b> on the curtain <b>100</b> and the log chute <b>2</b>. The main function of the air curtain <b>100</b> is to prevent the flow of air from the inside out and from outside in. There is no draft when the log chute <b>2</b> is in the out position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view showing the improved log chute <b>2</b> in the first position <b>20</b>. This view shows the loading position <b>20</b> or first position <b>20</b> where the log chute <b>2</b> is loaded with fire wood <b>10</b> from the outside of a building <b>14</b>. While the log chute <b>2</b> is in this position the second side <b>6</b> rests tightly against the frame <b>8</b> mounted in wall <b>12</b> preventing outside elements from entering the building <b>14</b>. This view also shows the pivoting hinge <b>24</b> that allows the log chute <b>2</b> the ability to move to the second position <b>22</b>. The first side <b>4</b> and the second side <b>6</b> serve to maintain the element barrier by interfacing with the frame <b>8</b> depending on the position of the log chute <b>2</b>. When the log chute is in the loading position <b>20</b> the second side <b>6</b> rests firmly against the frame <b>8</b> preventing air flow into the building <b>14</b> and when it is in the unloading <b>20</b> or second position <b>20</b> the first side <b>4</b> fits against the frame <b>8</b> preventing air flow as well.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view showing the improved log chute <b>2</b> in the second position <b>22</b>. This view shows the opposite of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where the log chute <b>2</b> is in the unloading position <b>22</b> or second position <b>22</b>. The log chute <b>2</b> has been moved on the pivoting hinge <b>24</b> moving the opening <b>40</b> to the interior of the building <b>14</b> for unloading.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view showing the improved log chute <b>2</b> in the first position <b>20</b> with the arm <b>26</b> in an extended position. This view expresses the essence of the improvement to the log chute <b>2</b>. The improvement in the log chute <b>2</b> is the ability to manipulate the position of the log chute <b>2</b> with the aid of an arm <b>26</b>. This arm <b>26</b> is operated by mechanical, hydraulic or other mechanisms that accomplish the movement of the log chute <b>2</b> from its first position <b>20</b> to its second position <b>22</b> and back again. In this embodiment the movement is facilitated by the use of a hydraulic arm <b>26</b>. This allows the user to manipulate the log chute <b>2</b> effortlessly reducing the potential for injury. It also allows the user to be one of lesser physical strength to accomplish the same task.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view showing the improved log chute <b>2</b> in the second position <b>22</b> with the arm <b>26</b> retracted. This view shows the log chute <b>2</b> after it has been moved to the second position <b>22</b> with the help of the arm <b>26</b>. Both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show the adaptation of the arm <b>26</b> to the log chute <b>2</b>. The arm <b>26</b> is connected to the second side <b>6</b> of the log chute <b>2</b> at connection point <b>28</b>. The arm <b>26</b> is attached to the base <b>30</b> which is mounted within a close approximation to the log chute <b>2</b>. <b>32</b> is the operating system for the arm, it can be manual, it can be electrically powered, it can be air driven, it can be hydraulically driven or any other means of operating the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view showing the improved log chute <b>2</b> with the interior cavity <b>34</b> that holds one embodiment of the placement of the arm <b>26</b>. This cavity <b>34</b> is incorporated into the log chute to protect the arm <b>26</b> and its operating system during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side view showing the placement of the arm <b>26</b> within the cavity <b>34</b> and being electronically powered. This is embodiment utilizes an electric switch <b>36</b> that when activated it energizes a motor that will manipulate the arm <b>26</b> moving the log chute <b>2</b> from its first position <b>20</b> or the loading position <b>20</b> to the second position <b>22</b> or its unloading position <b>22</b>. Here the arm <b>26</b> is connected internally to the log chute <b>2</b> and operates from the internal cavity <b>34</b> for the manipulation of the log chute <b>2</b>. The air curtain can be manufacture from any material that is suitable for the purpose of creating a barrier that is capable of preventing the outside environment from coming into the dwelling equipped with the log chute <b>2</b>.</p>
