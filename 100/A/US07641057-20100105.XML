<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to adjustable shelving systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to adjustable forward feeding display shelving system for storing and displaying merchandise of a variety of shapes and sizes and urging such merchandise towards the front of a shelf. The shelving system is configured to organize merchandise on the shelf into rows.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shelving is used extensively for stocking and storing products or merchandise in a variety of stores. Most stores simply employ shelves on which merchandise is stocked. In such stores if the shelves are not at eye level, it is difficult for the customer to see the items being displayed unless they are located adjacent the front edge of the shelf. Such conventional shelves also make it difficult to rotate the product on the shelves, which involves moving the older stock to the front of the shelf and positioning new stock behind the older stock. This has to be done manually by an employee. Thus, for a number of important merchandising considerations, it is desirable that the merchandise be displayed at the front of a shelf so that the customer can see the merchandise and be induced to purchase such merchandise. For example, if goods are perishable or are subject to becoming stale (e.g. cigarettes, fruit juices, dairy products or any item with an expiration date or a freshness date) it is important that the articles be removed in a first in first out basis to maintain freshness. As mentioned, if the merchandise is not displayed at the front of the shelf, it may not catch the shopper's eye, which may cost the merchant sales.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to automatically move an item forward as the one before it is removed, numerous forward feed devices have been proposed. These devices generally fall into three categories. The first category is inclined tracks, which rely on gravity to feed, slide or roll products forward. Gravity feeding is somewhat unpredictable in that various materials slide easier than others because of different weights and frictional interfaces between the products and the track. A second category employs conveyor belts, which still use gravity to effect forward movement. These devices are typically cumbersome, expensive and complicated due to the need to properly tension and track the conveyor belts. A third category uses spring biased paddles in a pusher system to feed the product forward. Such pusher systems have been found useful for certain merchandise.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Forward feed devices are usually associated with divider walls. Normally, a divider wall is located on either side of, for example, a pusher system. Both the pusher system and the divider wall are mounted to at least a front rail or front mounting member in order to allow a spacing of the pusher systems and divider walls on a shelf. In some known systems, the divider walls are separate from the pusher systems. In others, the divider walls and pusher systems are of one piece. In either case, the divider walls and pusher systems can be slidably mounted on the front rail or mounting member. This, however, has some disadvantages. Such disadvantages have to do with the fact that as the merchandise is being urged forward by the pusher, the merchandise may urge the dividers to slide laterally away from each other along the mounting member thus interfering with adjacent rows of merchandise, possibly making such merchandise more difficult to retrieve. This is particularly true with cans and other merchandise having rounded sides, since with such merchandise one item can rotate in relation to another as it is being pushed forward.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain merchandising systems employ a design in which the divider wall and the pusher are locked to a front rail or mounting member so as to prevent a sideward sliding thereof. However, with these known designs, the dividers and the pusher systems have to be physically removed from contact with the front rail in order to provide lateral adjustability thereto. The known systems also have other disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it has been considered desirable to develop a new improved shelf divider system which would overcome the foregoing difficulties and others while providing better and more advantageous overall results.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating several preferred embodiments of the invention and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of a shelf divider system according to the present invention. In this embodiment, a mounting member or front rail <b>10</b> includes a vertically oriented wall <b>12</b>. With reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vertically oriented wall <b>12</b> includes a first section <b>14</b>, a first groove <b>16</b> and a second section <b>18</b>. Also provided on the mounting member <b>10</b> is a horizontally oriented wall <b>20</b>. Disposed between the horizontally oriented wall section and the vertical wall section <b>12</b> is a second groove <b>22</b>. There is a recessed portion <b>26</b> with an opening <b>28</b> located in the horizontal wall <b>20</b>. The wall <b>20</b> includes a front face <b>30</b>, a top face <b>32</b> and a back face <b>34</b>. Defined at the intersection of the top face <b>32</b> and the back face <b>34</b> is a first row or set of teeth <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Mounted in the first groove <b>16</b> is a front fence <b>40</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a suitable conventional fastener <b>42</b> can extend through the opening <b>28</b> in the horizontal wall <b>20</b> of the mounting member <b>10</b> so as to secure the mounting member in place on a subjacent shelf A, which has suitable apertures for this purpose. It should be appreciated that a plurality of such openings <b>28</b> may be provided on the front rail <b>10</b>. It should also be appreciated that the fastener <b>42</b> is located in the recessed portion <b>26</b> of the horizontal wall so as to not interfere with shelf dividers or pusher tracks secured to the front rail. It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that the mounting member <b>10</b> can be somewhat L-shaped in side view. Of course, the mounting member could also have other shapes, if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, a shelf divider and pusher track, which is of one piece, is disclosed. However, it should be appreciated that separate shelf divider walls and pusher tracks can also be employed with the mounting member or front rail <b>10</b> disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a shelf divider <b>50</b> is mounted on the mounting member or front rail <b>10</b>. The shelf divider includes a horizontally oriented base wall <b>52</b> and a vertically oriented divider wall <b>54</b>. Located on a bottom face <b>58</b> the base <b>52</b> is a transversely extending slot <b>60</b>. With reference now again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the slot <b>60</b> includes a front face <b>62</b>, a roof <b>64</b> and a rear face <b>66</b>. Extending forwardly from the rear face are a set of rear protrusions <b>68</b>. Defined on such protrusions is a second row or set of teeth <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shelf divider base wall <b>52</b> has a first section <b>72</b> and a second section <b>74</b>. Defined on the second section is a flange or rail <b>76</b>. Positioned adjacent the flange is a channel or groove <b>78</b>. A pusher member <b>80</b> is slidably mounted on the base wall second section <b>74</b>. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pusher member <b>80</b> includes a vertically extending pusher wall <b>82</b> and a base wall <b>84</b>. Connecting the pusher wall and the base wall are first and second brace walls or gussets <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Depending from the base wall <b>84</b> is a foot <b>90</b>. In this embodiment, a first portion <b>92</b> of the foot can be aligned with the first brace wall <b>86</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A second portion or flange <b>94</b> of the foot can be oriented approximately normal to the first portion <b>92</b> and can be parallel to a plane of the base wall <b>84</b>. Thus, a somewhat U-shaped section is formed for accommodating the flange or rail <b>76</b> extending from the base wall second section <b>74</b>. Protruding from a lower surface <b>96</b> of the base wall <b>84</b> is a rib or protrusion <b>98</b>. The protrusion includes a pair of side walls <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>. It should be apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> that the second side wall <b>102</b> is spaced a considerable distance from a first side wall <b>104</b> of the channel or groove <b>78</b> but that the protrusion first side wall <b>100</b> is located adjacent the groove second side wall <b>106</b>. Located on the base wall second section <b>74</b> are top rails <b>108</b> and bottom rails <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a coil spring <b>120</b> can be housed on the pusher member <b>80</b>. More particularly, the coil spring is supported on the base wall <b>84</b> between the pair of brace walls. A section <b>122</b> of the coil spring extends through a slot <b>124</b> in the pusher wall <b>82</b>. A front end (not illustrated) of the coil spring can be secured to a front portion of the shelf divider. In use, as the pusher <b>80</b> reciprocates on the track formed by a flange <b>76</b>, the channel <b>78</b> and the rails <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, the pusher base <b>84</b> and foot <b>90</b> ride on the top and bottom rails <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> such that the lower surface <b>96</b> of the base wall contacts at least one of the top rails <b>108</b> while the second portion <b>94</b> of the foot or guide contacts the bottom rail <b>110</b>. Due to the cooperation of the foot <b>90</b> and the protrusion <b>98</b> with the base wall second section <b>74</b>, the pusher <b>80</b> can not be lifted away from the track. Rather, the pusher must be slid to an end of the track to be subsequently removed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it can be seen that when the pusher <b>80</b> is fully retracted, it can at least partially extend past a rear wall <b>130</b> of the shelf divider <b>50</b>. However, the pusher does not fall off the shelf divider as a rear edge <b>132</b> of the foot second portion <b>94</b> contacts a depending section <b>134</b> of the rear wall <b>130</b>. Since the pusher can be retracted past the rear end of the divider member <b>50</b>, a system of the present invention can be used on a shelf that is somewhat deeper than is the length of the divider <b>50</b>. Thus, the present system is capable of accommodating shelving of the varying depths. Of course, if the shelf is no deeper than the length of divider <b>50</b> then no part of the pusher will be able to retract past the end of the divider as the pusher will contact the rear surface of the shelf. In order to stiffen the two brace walls <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>, stiffening ribs <b>136</b> can be employed, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Moreover, the pusher wall <b>82</b> can have an enlarged upper end <b>138</b> in order to better accommodate wider merchandise that is being urged forwardly on the track by the pusher member.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, it can be seen that the angle of the front face <b>30</b> in relation to a plane of the second groove <b>22</b> can be, for example, 71&#xb0;. In contrast, the angle between the front face <b>62</b> and the roof <b>64</b> of the slot <b>60</b> located in the shelf divider <b>50</b> can be 70&#xb0;. As a result, when the shelf divider is completely seated on the mounting member <b>10</b> a pinching action takes place between the front face <b>62</b> and roof <b>64</b> of the divider <b>50</b> and the front face <b>30</b> and top face <b>32</b> of the mounting member <b>10</b>. Such pinching action locks the shelf divider <b>50</b> onto the mounting member to retard a sideward sliding motion of the shelf divider on the mounting member. Such pinching action is possible due to the resilient nature of the materials from which the shelf divider and the mounting member are made. If desired, these two components can be made of suitable conventional resilient materials, such as known thermoplastic materials. These will allow some relative flexing between the two as the shelf divider is mounted on or detached from the mounting member or rail. The two components can be made from the same material or from different materials. It should, of course, be appreciated that other suitable angles could be provided on the interengaging surfaces of the mounting member and the shelf divider to provide the desired pinching action or locking action.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Of course, such sideward sliding movement is also retarded by the interengaging sets of teeth <b>36</b> and <b>70</b> on the mounting member and the shelf divider respectively. To this end, the back face <b>34</b> is angled forwardly by 5&#xb0; from the vertical. Similarly, the rear protrusions <b>68</b> are angled forwardly by 5&#xb0; from the vertical. Thus, there is a mating engagement of the mounting member back face with the rear protrusion <b>68</b> of the shelf divider <b>50</b>. In this embodiment, the pinch point occurs only at the engagement of the mounting member front face <b>30</b> with the shelf divider front face <b>62</b>. However, it should be appreciated that such pinch points could be located at other positions along the engagement surfaces of the mounting member and shelf divider.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As is best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the locking action of the shelf divider <b>50</b> on the mounting member <b>10</b> takes place when the shelf divider is fully lowered onto the mounting member. However, when a rear end of the shelf divider is slightly lifted, the shelf divider is rotated in relation to the mounting member. This action unlocks the shelf divider from the mounting member, disengages the two sets of teeth <b>36</b> and <b>70</b> and allows the shelf divider to be moved along the mounting member to a desired location. To this end, the shelf divider can either be slid along the mounting member or simply pulled away from the mounting member and laterally moved to the desired location and then reconnected with the mounting member.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an end wall <b>150</b> for the shelf divider system includes a base <b>152</b> and an upright portion <b>154</b>. With reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a transversely extending slot <b>156</b> is located adjacent a first end of the end wall <b>150</b>. The slot <b>156</b> is adapted to accommodate the horizontal wall <b>20</b> of the mounting member <b>10</b>. A front edge <b>157</b> of the divider is seated in the second groove <b>22</b>. Also provided for the end wall <b>150</b> is a recessed area <b>158</b>. Located in the recessed area are spaced first and second sockets <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. Cooperating with the end wall <b>150</b> is a flange <b>170</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The flange includes a first arm <b>172</b>, and, spaced therefrom, a second arm <b>174</b>. Each of these arms have a tooth <b>176</b> positioned on their distal end. The arms are adapted to extend through the sockets <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> so that the teeth protrude past the far edge of the base in order to clip or lock the flange <b>170</b> into place in the end wall <b>150</b>. Provided on the flange are a plurality of slots <b>178</b> and apertures <b>180</b>. These are meant to accommodate suitable conventional fasteners (not shown) in order to secure the end wall in place on the associated shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a second embodiment of a shelf divider system according to the present invention is there illustrated. In this embodiment, a rail or mounting member includes a vertically oriented wall <b>192</b> having a first groove <b>194</b> and a horizontally oriented wall <b>196</b> as well as a second groove <b>198</b>. Selectively secured to the rail is a divider <b>210</b> having a base wall <b>212</b> and a vertically oriented dividing wall <b>214</b>. A transverse slot <b>218</b> extends across a bottom surface of the base. The base thus has a front edge <b>220</b> which is adapted to fit into the second groove <b>198</b> while the slot extends over the horizontal wall <b>196</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In this embodiment, no teeth are employed. Rather, a smooth set of engaging walls is disclosed in this embodiment. Thus, the set of engaging walls can be even, free from irregularities, roughness or projections. The locking feature is achieved by suitably configuring the engaging surfaces of the slot and the mounting member horizontal wall, along the lines discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> hereinbefore.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In other words, a locking engagement can be achieved when the divider <b>210</b> is fully lowered onto the mounting member <b>190</b> because of the differing angles provided for the mating surfaces of the mounting member and the divider. Even a 1&#xb0; difference in the angles of the front face <b>198</b> of the horizontal wall <b>190</b> and the front face of the slot <b>218</b> is adequate to provide the desired pinching or locking action. Such a 1&#xb0; difference was disclosed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. Of course, other suitable angular relationships between the mating faces could also be employed. In order to detach the divider <b>210</b> from the mounting member <b>190</b>, an installer merely has to raise a distal end <b>222</b> of the divider <b>210</b> thereby disengaging the locking feature. At this point, the divider can then be slid in relation to the mounting member <b>190</b> along the second groove <b>198</b>. Alternatively, the divider can be detached from the mounting member and then moved in relation to it. It should be appreciated that the mounting member or rail can be secured to a subjacent shelf adjacent a front edge of the shelf or adjacent a rear edge of the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a third embodiment of a shelf divider system according to the present invention is there illustrated.

These engage the first set of teeth <b>242</b> on the rear rail <b>230</b> so as to lock the divider in place on the rear rail. The divider <b>250</b> also includes a track <b>264</b> on which is mounted a pusher <b>268</b>. The pusher can reciprocate along the track from adjacent the rear rail <b>230</b> to a forward position on a shelf on which the system is mounted. In this embodiment, a front wall <b>270</b> is provided for the track <b>264</b>. The front wall can be of one piece with the divider <b>250</b> or it can be a separate element that is suitably connected to either the divider or to the shelf on which the divider is mounted.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It should be appreciated that the various mounting members illustrated in, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-24</figref> can be positioned at either the front edge of a shelf or the rear edge of the shelf, just as the mounting member of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is positioned adjacent a front edge of the shelf and mounting member of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is positioned adjacent the rear edge of the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the previous embodiments, the mounting member is shown to have a vertical wall, a horizontal wall and a slot defined between these two walls. However, it should be appreciated that other types of mounting member designs are also contemplated. For example, as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a mounting member <b>470</b> can have a somewhat different configuration as well. In this embodiment, the mounting member <b>470</b> includes a vertical wall <b>472</b> and a horizontal wall <b>474</b>. In this design, there is no separate slot defined between the vertical wall and the horizontal wall. Also, in this design, there is a raised area or plateau <b>476</b> located on the horizontal wall. Mounted atop the raised area <b>476</b> is a set or row of teeth <b>478</b>. As in the earlier designs, the teeth can cooperate with suitable teeth located on a divider element, a track element or a combination divider and track assembly, as previously disclosed herein. It can be appreciated that the cooperating divider, track or combination divider and track assembly would need to be suitably configured in order to be accommodated on the mounting member.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a yet twelfth version of a mounting member <b>490</b> is there disclosed. In this embodiment, the mounting member includes a vertical wall <b>492</b> and a horizontal wall <b>494</b>. A set of teeth <b>496</b> is disposed on an upper surface <b>498</b> of the horizontal wall. In this design, the cooperating divider wall, pusher track or combination divider wall and pusher track is seated on the mounting member horizontal wall <b>494</b> and engages the teeth on the horizontal wall so as to retard a sidewards sliding motion of the cooperating member. It can be appreciated that the cooperating member would need to be suitably configured for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, there is disclosed a yet thirteenth embodiment of a mounting member <b>510</b> according to the present invention.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a fourteenth embodiment of a shelf divider system according to the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, a mounting member or front rail <b>610</b> includes a vertically oriented wall <b>612</b>. With reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-31</figref>, the vertically oriented wall <b>612</b> includes a first section <b>614</b>, a first groove <b>616</b> and a second section <b>618</b>. Also provided on the mounting member <b>610</b> is a horizontally oriented wall <b>620</b>. Disposed between the horizontally oriented wall section and the vertical wall section <b>612</b> is a second groove <b>622</b>. The wall <b>620</b> includes a front face <b>630</b>, a top face <b>632</b> and a back face <b>634</b>. Defined at the intersection of the top face <b>632</b> and the back face <b>634</b> is a rounded corner <b>635</b>. Located on the back face <b>634</b> is a first row or set of teeth <b>636</b>. In fact, the wall <b>620</b> may be termed a raised area or plateau, since its top face <b>632</b> is located at a higher elevation than is the surface of the groove <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Mounted in the first groove <b>616</b> is a front fence <b>640</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>. A recessed portion with an opening can be located in the horizontal wall (not illustrated) for accommodating fasteners to secure the front rail <b>610</b> to the shelf A, as in the earlier embodiments. It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> that the mounting member <b>610</b> can be somewhat L-shaped in side view. Of course, the mounting member <b>610</b> could also have other shapes, if so desired. In this embodiment, a shelf divider <b>650</b> and a pusher track <b>676</b>, which are of two separate pieces, are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28</figref>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b>, the shelf divider <b>650</b> is mounted on the mounting member <b>610</b>. The shelf divider <b>650</b> includes a horizontally oriented base wall <b>652</b> and a vertically oriented divider wall <b>654</b>. Located on a bottom face <b>658</b> of the base wall <b>652</b> is a transversely extending slot <b>660</b>. The slot <b>660</b> includes a roof <b>665</b> and a rear face <b>667</b>. The slot <b>660</b> also includes a front face <b>662</b> which is defined by a rear edge of a flange <b>663</b>. The flange <b>663</b> extends transversely along the bottom face <b>658</b> of the base wall <b>652</b>. The flange <b>663</b> includes a front face <b>664</b> and a bottom face <b>666</b>. Extending forwardly from the slot rear face <b>667</b> are a set of rear protrusions or teeth <b>668</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. With reference now again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, the shelf divider base wall <b>652</b> has a first side flange <b>671</b> and a second side flange <b>672</b>. The side flanges <b>671</b> and <b>672</b> can include longitudinally extending rails or raised areas <b>673</b> and <b>674</b> for supporting merchandise thereon. The first side flange <b>671</b> can include an outwardly extending spacer member <b>675</b> which extends along a majority of the length of the side flange <b>671</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref>, the separate track <b>676</b> can be slidably mounted to the mounting member <b>610</b>. The track <b>676</b> includes a pair of elongated rails <b>677</b> and <b>678</b> extending longitudinally along the edges of a top surface of the track <b>676</b>. A series of longitudinally extending guide sections <b>679</b> and <b>680</b> are positioned adjacent the rails <b>677</b> and <b>678</b> and define a central channel <b>681</b> therebetween. The track <b>676</b> includes a horizontally oriented base wall <b>682</b> which can rest upon the shelf. Located on a bottom face <b>683</b> of the base wall <b>682</b> is a transversely extending slot <b>684</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the slot <b>684</b> includes a roof <b>686</b> and a rear face <b>687</b>. The slot <b>684</b> also includes a front face <b>685</b> which is defined by a rear edge of a flange <b>688</b>. The flange <b>688</b> extends transversely along the bottom face <b>683</b> of the base wall <b>682</b>. The flange <b>688</b> includes a front face <b>689</b> and a bottom face <b>690</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>, a pusher member <b>692</b> is shown which can be slidably mounted on the track <b>676</b> in a reciprocating manner. The pusher member <b>692</b> includes a vertically extending pusher wall <b>693</b> and a base wall <b>694</b>. Connecting the pusher wall <b>693</b> and the base wall <b>694</b> are first and second brace walls or gussets <b>696</b> and <b>698</b>. As described above, the two brace walls <b>696</b> and <b>698</b> can be stiffened with stiffening ribs <b>726</b>. Depending from the base wall <b>694</b> is a foot <b>700</b>. In this embodiment, a first portion <b>702</b> of the foot extends normally from the base wall <b>694</b> and is positioned between the gussets <b>696</b> and <b>698</b>. A second portion or flange <b>703</b> of the foot can be oriented approximately normal to the first portion <b>702</b> and can be parallel to a plane of the base wall <b>694</b>. Similarly, a third portion or flange <b>704</b> of the foot can be oriented approximately normal to the first portion <b>702</b> and can be parallel to the plane of the base wall <b>694</b>. Thus, a pair of somewhat U-shaped sections are formed for accommodating the guide sections <b>679</b> and <b>680</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>), whereby the first portion <b>702</b> is positioned in the central channel <b>681</b> and flanges <b>703</b> and <b>704</b> can slide underneath guide sections <b>679</b> and <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It is to be appreciated that a coil spring <b>720</b> can be housed on the pusher member <b>692</b>. More particularly, the coil spring <b>720</b> can be supported on a support wall <b>721</b> extending between the pair of brace walls <b>696</b> and <b>698</b>. A front end of the coil spring <b>720</b> can be secured to a front portion of the shelf divider. A central section of the coil spring <b>720</b> extends away from the pusher <b>692</b> through a slot <b>722</b> defined in the pusher wall <b>693</b>. With reference now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, it can be seen that the coil spring is mounted on the support wall <b>721</b>, curls around a back end thereof and then extends forwardly out through the slot <b>722</b>. In use, as the pusher <b>692</b> reciprocates on the track <b>676</b> formed by the guide sections <b>679</b> and <b>680</b>, the channel <b>681</b> and the rails <b>677</b> and <b>678</b>, a lower surface <b>706</b> of the base wall <b>694</b> contacts and rides along the rails <b>677</b> and <b>678</b>. Due to the cooperation of the foot <b>700</b> and the flanges <b>703</b> and <b>704</b> with the guide sections <b>679</b> and <b>680</b>, the pusher <b>692</b> can not be lifted away from the track. Rather, the pusher <b>692</b> must be slid to an end of the track to be subsequently removed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 39</figref>, track <b>676</b> includes a downward sloping section <b>710</b>. It can be seen that when the pusher <b>692</b> is fully retracted, a front edge <b>712</b> of the foot <b>700</b> can be tilted downward along the sloping section <b>710</b>. The front edge <b>712</b> engages a stop wall <b>714</b> located adjacent the forward end of the sloping section <b>710</b>. The engagement of first portion <b>702</b> and stop wall <b>714</b> prevents movement of the pusher <b>692</b> along the track <b>676</b>. In this manner, the pusher <b>692</b> can remain stationary to facilitate the stocking of sale items on the shelf system. To once again allow sliding of pusher <b>692</b>, the pusher wall <b>693</b> is tilted backward to align the foot <b>700</b> with the track <b>676</b>. The pusher <b>692</b> does not fall off the track as a rear edge <b>718</b> of the foot <b>700</b> contacts a depending section <b>715</b> of a rear wall <b>717</b> of the track <b>676</b>. In order to connect the two rails <b>677</b> and <b>678</b>, connecting ribs <b>713</b> can be employed, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 39</figref>. It is a rearmost one of the connecting ribs which can serve as the stop wall <b>714</b>. Moreover, the pusher wall <b>693</b> can have an enlarged upper end <b>728</b> in order to better accommodate wider merchandise that is being urged forwardly on the track <b>676</b> by the pusher member <b>692</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, it can be seen that the angle of the front face <b>630</b> of the wall <b>620</b> in relation to a plane of the second groove <b>622</b> can be, for example, 52&#xb0;. The angle between the shelf divider front face <b>662</b> in relation to a plane of the roof <b>665</b> in the slot <b>660</b> can be slightly less than 52&#xb0; (ie. 51&#xb0;). As a result, when the shelf divider <b>650</b> is seated on the mounting member <b>610</b>, a pinching action takes place between the front face <b>662</b> of the slot <b>660</b> and the front face <b>630</b> of the horizontal wall <b>620</b>. Such pinching action engages the shelf divider <b>650</b> to the mounting member <b>610</b> to retard a sideward sliding motion of the shelf divider <b>650</b> on the mounting member <b>610</b>. Such pinching action is possible due to the resilient nature of the materials from which the shelf divider and the mounting member are made. If desired, these two components can be made of suitable conventional resilient materials, such as known thermoplastic materials. These will allow some relative flexing between the two as the shelf divider <b>650</b> is mounted on or detached from the mounting member <b>610</b>. The two components can be made from the same material or from different materials. It should, of course, be appreciated that other suitable angles could be provided on the interengaging surfaces of the mounting member and the shelf divider to provide the desired pinching action or locking action. In this embodiment, the pinch point occurs at the engagement of the horizontal wall <b>620</b> front face <b>630</b> with the slot front face <b>662</b>. However, it should be appreciated that such pinch points could be located at other positions along the engagement surfaces of the mounting member and shelf divider.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Of course, such sideward sliding movement is also retarded by the interengaging sets of teeth <b>636</b> and <b>668</b> on the mounting member <b>610</b> and the shelf divider <b>650</b> respectively. To this end, the back face <b>634</b> can be angled forwardly by 5&#xb0; from the vertical. Similarly, the rear face <b>667</b> can be angled forwardly by 5&#xb0; from the vertical. Thus, there is a mating engagement of the mounting member back face with the rear face <b>667</b> of the shelf divider <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As is best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the locking action of the shelf divider <b>650</b> on the mounting member <b>610</b> takes place when the shelf divider is fully lowered onto the mounting member. However, when a rear end of the shelf divider is slightly lifted, the shelf divider is rotated in relation to the mounting member. This action unlocks the shelf divider from the mounting member, disengages the two sets of teeth <b>636</b> and <b>670</b> and allows the shelf divider to be moved along the mounting member <b>610</b> to a desired location. To this end, the shelf divider can either be slid along the mounting member <b>610</b> or simply pulled away from the mounting member <b>610</b> and laterally moved to the desired location and then reconnected with the mounting member <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the angle between a track front face <b>685</b> in relation to a plane of the slot roof <b>686</b> located in the track <b>676</b> can be slightly less than 52&#xb0; (ie. 51&#xb0;). As a result, when the track <b>676</b> is completely seated on the mounting member <b>610</b> a pinching action takes place between the front face <b>685</b> and roof <b>686</b> of the track <b>676</b> and the front face <b>630</b> and top face <b>632</b> of the horizontal wall <b>620</b>. Such pinching action retains the track <b>676</b> onto the mounting member <b>610</b> to retard a sideward sliding motion of the track <b>676</b> on the mounting member, as previously discussed in connection with other embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As is best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, the pinching action of the track <b>676</b> on the horizontal wall <b>620</b> only takes place when the track <b>676</b> is fully lowered onto the mounting member <b>610</b>. However, when a rear end of the track is slightly lifted, the track is rotated in relation to the mounting member. This action releases the track <b>676</b> from the mounting member and allows the track <b>676</b> to be moved sideways in relation to the mounting member to a desired location. To this end, the track <b>676</b> can either be slid along the mounting member or simply pulled away from the mounting member and laterally moved to the desired location and then reconnected with the mounting member.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the embodiments discussed hereinbefore, either a front mounting member/rail or a rear mounting member/rail was employed. However, it should be recognized that both a front rail and a rear rail can be utilized as mounting members for mounting a combination shelf divider and pusher track or separate shelf dividers and pusher tracks. The use of two rail designs in general is known in the art. Therefore, it can be appreciated that two rails or mounting members can be employed in the adjustable shelving system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the various embodiments disclosed herein, the contact surface located on the divider member or track or member which cooperates with the mounting member or front rail is disclosed as being located in the slot. However, it should be appreciated that the contact surface, which can be a set of teeth, can also be located near the slot, adjoining the slot, in proximity to the slot, in the vicinity of the slot and the like. Thus, the second contact surface does not necessarily have to lie within the slot or be contiguous with or abutting, touching or in juxtaposition with the slot. Rather, it can be in the neighborhood of the slot. The location of the second contact surface, which can be a second set of teeth, is determined by the location of the first contact surface, which can be a first set of teeth, on the mounting member or track. All that is necessary is that the two engage each other and cooperate with each other in order to retard a sideward sliding motion of the divider track or cooperating member in relation to the elongated mounting member or rail.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">While the embodiments disclosed herein illustrate the use of a slot, i.e., a transverse groove or opening, it should be appreciated that other types of openings could be provided along the bottom face of the cooperating member, track or divider assembly disclosed herein. Thus, any type of suitable aperture, way, path, channel, passage or other suitable gap could be employed. For example, a set of notches could be provided along the bottom face instead of a single slot if the mounting member or rail were suitably configured. Thus, the term &#x201c;slot&#x201d; as used herein is intended to include all such openings, apertures, holes, orifices, passages, grooves, troughs, channels, indentations and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon the reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
