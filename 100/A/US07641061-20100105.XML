<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A retail display system for increasing density of merchandising of products, by using the otherwise unused space of existing display configurations. A hanger display configuration, which may hold vertical strip displays, is installed in such a manner as to adapt to a diverse range of product packaging and shelving fixture types, efficiently provide signage, pricing and scanning information, and to reduce theft. The hanger display configuration can be manufactured for a specific product and specific quantity of such product. Faceplates have clamps on the rear face for clamping the faceplates to seldom-used non-shelve portions of the rack display and other store fixtures, such as bars, stanchions, corners, etc.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to providing an improved system for displaying and marketing merchandise, including more efficient use of space and better inventory control. More particularly, this invention concerns a highly adaptable retail display system that efficiently uses normally unused space within a store to display and sell merchandise. The field of product display and marketing has increasingly become a more exact science involving extensive research into the shopping and purchasing behaviors of consumers. As a result, retailers have become increasingly sophisticated in their application of product-display systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, a retail space will include a diverse range of product-display fixtures. Arrangement of such fixtures often follows a set of tactics for ensuring that a maximum number of shoppers will see and actively consider purchasing a displayed product. It is well-known that specific prime locations within a retail floor space are highly desirable for generation of sales. Similarly, prime locations within, and on, display-fixtures are known to produce higher sales volume. A principal need of many retailers is to maximize the quantity of products displayed within a given floor area, and more specifically, to maximize the display of products with the highest sales volumes, cash values and profit margins within the prime store locations. In addition, distributors often pay additional bonuses or rewards to stores that choose to assign a highly desired space to display their particular product line. For these and other reasons, it is economically important to most retailers to utilize the maximum amount of available product display space within a store.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, many product vendors require flexibility in displaying their product and controlling their inventory within the product display system. Currently, a large number of retailers rely on cumbersome, industry standard, retail display systems that allow only limited flexibility in arrangement, ease of modification and product-specific display. Many retailers utilize the theory that the best solution for some product lines is to create relatively static, permanent displays; however, not all products merit such long-term placement. Many products are not always in large demand or are seasonal. For example, promotional products tied to a seasonal holiday or new movie release may have a relatively short (yet highly lucrative) promotional window. It is highly desirable that product placement systems that are easy to modify and provide a high degree of adaptability (quickly adaptable to new marketing strategies and inventory management solutions) would be extremely desirable for use in the retail industry.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, many retailers use a variety of add-on merchandising displays in conjunction with existing conventional shelving construction to increase product display densities. These methods include utilizing vertically hanging strip-displays that have a vertical row of hooks or clips for holding packages of merchandise. While this type of typical strip-type-merchandising-system is effective for the display of certain products, they suffer from distinct shortcomings. For example, strip-type merchandising systems are typically made of flimsy construction that may be easily dislodged or removed from its supports. Further, such strip-type merchandising systems are limited in their adaptability to a diverse range of packaging, product lines, display quantities and shelving types. Further, most strip-type merchandising systems provide limited opportunities for supplementary advertising and product branding (the display of a specific or well-established brand name of merchandise). As previously mentioned, such strip-type merchandising systems are typically not securely affixed to store fixtures and may even be stolen or removed easily by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Merchandisers, marketers, and advertisers are increasingly seeking to attract buyers by rapidly revising product packaging, as well as marketing strategies. These revisions require the retailer to find flexibility and adaptability within their own product display systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A primary object and feature of the present invention is to fulfill the above-mentioned needs by the provision of a vertical strip display system that displays merchandise for sale using assorted non-shelf portions, space otherwise unused, of existing display fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, it is a primary object and feature that the display system is installed in such a manner as to deter theft of such strip displays.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, it is a primary object and feature of this invention to provide a strip display system that is adaptable to a diverse range of product packaging and shelving fixture types.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further primary object and feature of this invention to efficiently provide signage, pricing and scanning information.</p>

Preferably, the mounting bracket <b>22</b> functions as a clamp as the set screws are tightened against the substrate upon which the mounting bracket <b>22</b> is installed (at least embodying herein wherein such at least one attacher comprises at least one clamp). The opening of the mounting bracket <b>22</b> &#x201c;U&#x201d; is variable; however, an about &#xbd;&#x2033; to about 4&#x2033; opening is preferred in order to be mounted over the majority of preferred store fixture construction materials.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plan view of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shown in an installed position on a typical end-cap merchandise fixture comprising a vertical end piece <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the attachment means provided by the combination of the mounting bracket <b>22</b> and a preferred embodiment of tightening (clamping) the mounting bracket <b>22</b> to the vertical end piece <b>18</b>, preferably using two set screws <b>38</b> attached from a single side of the mounting bracket <b>22</b>. There are multiple preferred embodiments of the set screw attachments as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view of a preferred embodiment of a flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> of the retail display system <b>30</b>. Preferably, the hook strip <b>36</b> (hook strip <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) comprises an elongated stem <b>35</b>, unitary in construction, with an upper hook strip attachment <b>24</b>, which may be round or more preferably flat, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is preferably a flat metal bar <b>48</b> approximately &#x215b;&#x2033; in thickness and about &#x215c;&#x2033; to about 2&#x2033; in width (at least embodying herein at least one bar, comprising at least one width, and at least one thickness, wherein such at least one width is substantially greater than such at least one thickness).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Preferably, the flat metal bar <b>48</b> extends approximately 2&#xbd;&#x2033; to about 4&#x2033; in length and is bent in the middle with a 180-degree arc/radius <b>46</b> to produce a hook segment <b>49</b>, as shown. Preferably, the hook segment <b>49</b> comprises a segment length (preferably about 1&#xbd;&#x2033; to about 3&#x2033;) adapted to pass through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and be secured from removal during installation of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to the faceplate aperture <b>32</b>, as shown. Preferably, the hook segment <b>49</b> is oriented substantially parallel to the elongated stem <b>35</b>, located on the opposite side of the bend, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (at least embodying herein at least one first substantially linear segment comprising at least one first segment length; and at least one second substantially linear segment comprising at least one second segment length; wherein such at least one first substantially linear segment and such at least one second substantially linear segment are connected by at least one bend so that such at least one first substantially linear segment and such at least one second substantially linear segment are substantially parallel and offset from each other).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Preferably, the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> (at least embodying herein at least one hook structured and arranged to removably engage such at least one aperture) is formed such that the outer flat peripheral shape closely matches the slot-shaped opening of the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This preferred arrangement limits &#x201c;side-to-side&#x201d; swinging of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> wherein rotation of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is restricted about an axis oriented substantially perpendicular to the front face <b>29</b> and the rear face <b>31</b> of the faceplate <b>20</b> (at least embodying herein wherein such at least one hook and such at least one elongated slot are structured and arranged so that such at least one hook closely fits within such at least one elongated slot to restrict rotation of such at least one merchandise display hanger about at least one axis oriented substantially perpendicular to such at least one front face). This preferred feature assists in maintaining the elongated stem <b>35</b> in a substantially vertical display position, thereby reducing spillage of merchandise due to an accidental (or malicious) side impact.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Preferably, the elongated stem <b>35</b> comprises hooks/clips <b>37</b> installed along its vertical length for the preferred purpose of clipping on merchandise to be displayed for sale (at least embodying herein at least one merchandise support member structured and arranged to support merchandise). These hooks and clips <b>37</b> may be spaced at assorted intervals to accommodate a variety of packaging sizes. When the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is inserted through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b>, and the mounting bracket <b>22</b> is tightened securely against the wood end-cap display vertical end piece <b>18</b>, the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is secured from removal. The unique securability of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is important in the prevention of theft of the entire hook strip <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Preferably, the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is engaged and disengaged with the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> by rotating the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> until the structure of the faceplate <b>20</b> no longer blocks the passage of the hook segment <b>49</b> through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (at least embodying herein wherein such at least one hook and such at least one aperture are structured and arranged so that such at least one merchandise display hanger can be removably attached to such at least one support plate by inserting such at least one hook into such at least one aperture). Preferably, the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is &#x201c;locked&#x201d; into place as it is positioned against the vertical end piece portion <b>18</b> and held firmly in place by the faceplate <b>20</b>. More specifically, the faceplate <b>20</b> and the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> are structured and arranged so that attaching the faceplate <b>20</b> adjacent the substantially flat surface of vertical end-piece portion <b>18</b> restricts rotation of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to prevent the reorienting of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to a position allowing removal from the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> (at least embodying herein wherein such at least one attacher, such at least one hook, and such at least one aperture are structured and arranged so that attaching such at least one attacher restricts the relative angular position of such at least one merchandise display hanger and such at least one support plate so that such at least one hook cannot be removed from such at least one aperture and further embodying herein wherein such at least at least one support plate and such at least one merchandise display hanger are structured and arranged so that attaching such at least one support plate adjacent a substantially flat surface restricts rotation of such at least one hook so that such at least one hook cannot be removed from such at least one aperture). Preferably, for best security, the radius of the arc <b>46</b> should be under 2&#x2033; for most applications, with a highly-preferred radius of about &#x215b;&#x2033;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of a flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, further illustrating the component parts of a preferred embodiment of a flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the installation method of the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to the faceplate <b>20</b> of the mounting bracket <b>22</b> using the faceplate aperture <b>32</b>. The mounting bracket <b>22</b> is placed at about 45 degrees to the perpendicular flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> which is then inserted through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> until the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> is resting on the point of the 180 degree radius <b>46</b>. It is clear from the illustrated depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> and the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> are both structured and arranged so that the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> can be removably inserted into the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> when the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> and the faceplate <b>20</b> are in a first relative angular position (about 45 degrees). Referring to the illustrated depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, preferably, the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> and the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> are also structured and arranged such that the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> cannot be removed from the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> when the flat hook strip attachment <b>24</b> and the faceplate <b>20</b> are rotated into a second (substantially vertical) angular position, as shown. The above-described arrangement at least embodies herein wherein such at least one hook and such at least one aperture are structured and arranged so that such at least one hook can be removably inserted into such at least one aperture when such at least one merchandise display hanger and such at least one support plate are in a first relative angular position; and wherein such at least one hook and such at least one aperture are structured and arranged so that such at least one hook cannot be removed from such at least one aperture when such at least one merchandise display hanger and such at least one support plate are rotated into a second relative angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A preferred &#x201c;non-disengageable&#x201d; coupling of the hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to the faceplate <b>20</b> is achieved with the connection of the hook strip attachment <b>24</b> through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> (with the hook strip attachment <b>24</b> and the faceplate <b>20</b> resting in the generally vertical position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), and the mounting bracket <b>22</b> of the faceplate <b>20</b> firmly clamped to a store display vertical end-piece <b>18</b>, as shown. More specifically, the mounting bracket <b>22</b> is preferably adapted to position the hook strip attachment <b>24</b> between the faceplate <b>20</b> and the vertical end-piece <b>18</b> to prevent rotation of the hook strip attachment <b>24</b> to a position allowing removal (at least embodying herein wherein such at least one attacher, such at least one hook, and such at least one aperture are structured and arranged so that attaching such at least one attacher prevents removal of such at least one hook). This preferred arrangement is an important improvement as theft of the hook strips and the contents is an industry problem for this type of display. The first described embodiment of such attachment is shown as two set screws tightly screwed-in to the store fixture vertical end-piece <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of another preferred embodiment of the hook strip attachment <b>25</b> of the retail display system. In this preferred embodiment, the hook strip attachment <b>25</b> is preferably round consisting of approximately a 3&#x2033; diameter round metal hook, about 2&#xbd;&#x2033; to about 4&#x2033; in length. The hook strip attachment <b>25</b> is a hook strip widely available and utilized by those knowledgeable in the art. The preferable connection of the hook strip attachment <b>25</b> and the mounting bracket <b>22</b> is when both the mounting bracket <b>22</b> and hook strip attachment <b>25</b> are resting connected through the faceplate aperture <b>32</b> and are perpendicular to the ground. In this embodiment, the hook strip attachment <b>25</b> is installed using aperture <b>34</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, round aperture portion <b>34</b> is structured and arranged to allow a &#xbc;&#x2033; round hook strip attachment <b>25</b> to be installed in the faceplate aperture <b>32</b>. When connected in the above described manner, the mounting bracket <b>22</b> is then attached to a store display vertical end-piece <b>18</b>. The embodiment of such attachment is shown as two set screws tightly screwed-in to the store fixture vertical end-piece <b>18</b>.
