<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A bed rail structured to minimize the gap between the mattress and the bed rail and including a leg portion and a rail portion. The rail portion extends upwardly on a first side of the mattress to extend beyond the sleeping surface of the mattress and prevent a person from rolling out of bed. The leg portion is sandwiched between the mattress and the box spring and extends toward a second side of the mattress. In one embodiment, the leg portion includes a distal end that is engaged to the second side of at least one of the mattress and box spring such that the distal end and rail portion hug the mattress. In another embodiment, the bed rail includes a relatively rigid cover depending from an upper portion of the rail portion to the sleeping surface so as to cover a gap that may exist between the first side of the mattress and the rail portion. In still another embodiment, the rail portion is set at an acute angle relative to the leg portion so as to tend to close off any gap between the first side of the mattress and the rail portion. In another embodiment, the wall of the rail portion may include tubing and the rail portion may be drawn against the bed with a strap extending about the periphery of the bed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates particularly to a bed rail and specifically to a bed rail that hugs the mattress to maximize a tight fit between the rail portion and the side of a mattress and to minimize the chance that a child can fall between the rail portion of the bed rail and the side of the mattress.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A bed rail is a structure engaged to the side of a bed to prevent a person, especially a child, from rolling out of bed and falling to the floor. A bed rail includes a leg portion that is sandwiched between the mattress and box spring. A bed rail further includes a rail portion that extends from the leg portion and upwardly to and beyond the sleeping surface of the bed. The rail portion forms the rail that prevents the child from rolling out of bed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A bed rail is intended to provide a safe sleeping environment, particularly for a child. However, the leg portion tends to work its way out from between the mattress and the box spring. As the leg portion works its way out, a gap is created between the side of the mattress and the rail portion of the bed rail. Children have rolled off the bed, have fallen into the gap, and have been entrapped between the bed rail and side of the mattress.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of a member engaged to the leg portion and adapted for engaging the second side of the bed such that the member and rail portion hug the bed therebetween to minimize a creation of a gap between the rail portion and the first side of the bed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of a cover depending from an upper portion of the rail portion and extending over a portion of the sleeping surface of the bed to cover any gap that may be created between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of the rail portion being set at an angle relative to the leg portion so that the rail portion confronts as much as possible the edge of the mattress where the sleeping surface joins the first side of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of the present bed rail is safety. The embodiments of the invention have means for minimizing the creation of the gap between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail is easy to set up so as to provide a tight fit between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail is difficult to set up when an attempt is made to create a less tight fit between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail includes a compact configuration for storage.</p>

The provision of the inclined surface <b>158</b> on button <b>150</b> permits the counter member <b>68</b> and rail portion <b>42</b> to be drawn towards each other automatically or with little effort. Accordingly, it is relatively easy to make the rail portion <b>42</b> fit tightly against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. The provision of the confronting surface <b>160</b> on button <b>150</b> permits the counter member <b>68</b> to be drawn apart from the rail portion <b>42</b> only with the difficulty associated with depressing button <b>150</b>. Accordingly, it is relatively difficult to loosen the bed rail <b>40</b> and therefore the chances of forming a gap <b>30</b> are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that rail portion <b>42</b> (or the plane in which the frame <b>32</b> of the rail portion <b>42</b> lies) is preferably set at an acute angle A relative to leg portion <b>44</b> (or at an acute angle to the plane in which the leg portions <b>44</b> lie). A pivot mechanism <b>170</b> may permit a swinging between the rail portion <b>42</b> and, in such a case, such pivot mechanism <b>170</b> does not permit a swinging to a right angle arrangement or to a swinging to an obtuse angle arrangement.

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Distal ends or distal end portions of upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are pivotally affixed via respective pins <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> to upper corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> such that tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> swing relative to tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Such relative swinging of tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> occurs in generally the same plane. An inner portion <b>234</b> of each of the corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are U-shaped in cross section to permit the tubes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> to swing relative to corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and toward tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Upper ends or upper end portions of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are rigidly affixed, with no pivotal swinging and no axial sliding, in a cylindrical receptacle formed in an outer portion <b>236</b> of each of the corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>. The cylindrical receptacle is a non-through hole. Each of the upper end portions of the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are fixed in their respective cylindrical receptacles with a pin. Such a pin is preferably a spring biased button which, upon being pushed into its respective side tube <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, permits the respective side tube <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to be withdrawn out of the cylindrical receptacle for disassembly and then snapped back in for reassembly.

Female receptor <b>246</b> is oblong in section to minimize an axial spinning of base leg sections <b>250</b> relative to the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and thus to minimize an axial spinning of the base leg sections <b>250</b> relative to the rail portion <b>204</b>. Base leg section <b>250</b> is rigidly fixed in receptor <b>246</b> and to body <b>240</b> via a pin <b>252</b>.

Cradle <b>254</b> is a semi-circular open end receptor having a pair of aligned through holes <b>260</b>. Holes <b>260</b> engage opposing ends of an outer two ended button <b>262</b> which is found on distal end portion <b>256</b> of lower tube <b>212</b> and which is further found on distal end portion <b>258</b> of lower tube <b>214</b>. Each of the ends of button <b>262</b> extends, in the biased and locked position, beyond the outer diametrical surface of its respective tube <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> such that each of the ends of button <b>262</b> can engage holes <b>260</b>. Each of the ends of button <b>262</b> is resiliently depressable or pushable radially into tube <b>212</b> or <b>214</b> such that the absolute end of button <b>262</b> is at or within the outer diametrical surface of tube <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> such that the button <b>262</b> can disengage from holes <b>260</b>. Outer two ended buttons <b>262</b> may be operated directly such as by sliding a fingernail between cradle <b>254</b> and the end of the button <b>262</b>. More preferably, each of the outer two ended buttons <b>262</b> is operated by a respective inner two ended button <b>264</b> that is not engaged by cradle <b>254</b> and that lies at an accessible location outside of cradle <b>254</b> when tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are engaged by cradles <b>254</b>.

The structural arrangement for buttons <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> includes a C-shaped flat spring pinched resiliently within each of the distal end portions <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> of tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Each of the ends of the C-spring includes one end of button <b>262</b> and one end of button <b>264</b> such that a pushing upon one end of inner button <b>264</b> draws the respective, same sided outer button <b>262</b> inwardly. Hence a pinching of the ends of inner button <b>264</b> radially inwardly also draws the outer ends of button <b>262</b> radially inwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Each of the sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> includes an upper open ended slot or detent <b>270</b> for receiving a roller <b>272</b> rotatably engaged on a pin <b>274</b>.

Tapering side <b>158</b> is a quick connect mechanism. Vertical side <b>160</b> is not a quick connect mechanism and requires hand operation directly on the button for operation. In other words, with such a structure provided to button <b>402</b>, namely tapering side <b>158</b>, counter attachment <b>404</b> is readily slid onto base leg portion <b>250</b> with no need to depress button <b>402</b> such that the rail portion <b>204</b> can readily hug the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> and such that there is no gap between the rail portion <b>204</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. With such a structure provided to button <b>402</b>, namely vertical side <b>160</b>, leg portion <b>202</b> cannot be increased in length, which would create a gap between the rail portion <b>204</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, without depressing button <b>402</b> because the vertical side <b>160</b> prevents counter attachment <b>404</b> from sliding out of base leg section <b>250</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As with counter attachment <b>404</b>, merely a relative minimum amount of effort is required to decrease the effective length of counter attachment <b>420</b>, given the relative orientations of tapering sides <b>158</b> of buttons <b>436</b> and <b>402</b>, such that the creation of any gap between the bed rail <b>200</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> is prevented. As with counter attachment <b>404</b>, a relative maximum amount of effort is required for increasing the effective length of counter attachment <b>420</b> because of the relative orientations of vertical sides <b>160</b> of buttons <b>436</b> and <b>402</b> so as to minimize the creation of any gap between the bed rail <b>200</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Counter attachment <b>404</b> may be utilized for a relatively small bed. Counter attachment <b>420</b> may be utilized for a relatively large bed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It is noted that, to increase the length of counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, effort is maximized in at least two ways. First, to gain access to the counter attachments, <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, the mattress <b>16</b> must be lifted off the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>. Since the counters <b>414</b>, <b>440</b> are maintained at an upright position, it is difficult to simply pull the bed rail <b>200</b> from between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b>. Second, once access is gained to the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, buttons <b>402</b>, <b>436</b> must be depressed and then redepressed for each of their respective slots <b>412</b>, <b>432</b> while the female section <b>406</b> is being removed from section <b>250</b> (or slid outwardly relative to each other) and while sections <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> are being separated (or slid outwardly relative to each other). Such a depression and a redepression takes time and effort and such a depression and redepression is preferred. Buttons <b>402</b> and <b>436</b> are resilient and spring based such that their bias is to the outer locked position and such buttons <b>402</b> and <b>436</b> pop out of slots <b>412</b> and <b>432</b> as sections are being slid relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the bed rail <b>200</b> in the process of being folded to a compact configuration. Leg portion <b>202</b> and rail portion <b>204</b> have been swung relatively to each other by the operation of connections <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> such that base leg sections <b>250</b> are disposed generally parallel to side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. From the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are disconnected from the connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and the lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are slid out of the lower wall section <b>380</b>. Then the hinge connection <b>220</b> is squeezed so as to operate the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b>. Indicia <b>450</b> is provided on the upper wall section <b>382</b> to indicate the location and general structure of the hinge mechanism <b>220</b> and unlocking mechanism <b>342</b>. An arrow indicia <b>452</b> is provided on the upper wall section <b>382</b> below indicia <b>450</b> and points at indicia <b>450</b> to indicate the direction the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> slides to unlock the hinge mechanism <b>3220</b>. Upon an unlocking of the upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> relative to each other, the outer ends of the bed rail <b>200</b> can be swung upwardly with the base leg sections <b>250</b> to the compact storage configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In a stored configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, bed rail <b>200</b> with each of the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> can fit in a nylon drawstring bag where the bag measures about seven inches in diameter and about 30 inches in depth.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the preferred embodiment for lower connection <b>226</b> (and <b>228</b>). In this preferred embodiment, side tube <b>216</b> (or <b>218</b>) is preferably set at an acute angle A relative to leg portion <b>202</b>, including leg base section <b>250</b>. In other words, the following features are aligned on an axis B: side tube <b>216</b> (or <b>218</b>), slots <b>288</b>, slots <b>270</b>, pin <b>290</b>, walls <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>. The following features are aligned on an axis C: female receptor <b>246</b>, base leg section <b>250</b>, and counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> (excluding the counters <b>414</b> and <b>440</b>). Axis B is preferably set at acute angle A relative to axis C. Body <b>240</b> is molded and its inner steel bracket is fabricated such that its features on axis A, including the opening for pin <b>290</b> and slots <b>270</b>, is set at acute angle A relative to female receptor or sleeve <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Such an acute angle A works to minimize any gap between the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> and the rail portion <b>204</b> for a number of reasons. First, because of the acute angle, the rail portion <b>204</b> lies closer to the upper side of mattress <b>16</b> than the lower side of the mattress <b>16</b>. The rail portion <b>204</b> is needed at the upper side to prevent a person from rolling off of the bed <b>24</b>. Second, except for perhaps high tech excessively expensive mechanical arrangements such as found at NASA, mechanical arrangements may loosen over time. The provision of features providing for angle A minimizes the chance that the angle A would become obtuse, i.e., greater than ninety degrees, whereby the rail portion <b>204</b> would extend upwardly and away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Third, angle A works in combination with counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> where the sections of the counter attachments are readily slideable relative to each other to decrease the effective length of the legs of leg portion <b>204</b>. In other words, as to this third point, mattress <b>16</b> may be hugged more tightly between counters <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>) and the rail portion <b>204</b> because acute angle A permits the rail portion <b>204</b> to give somewhat. Rail portion <b>204</b> gives somewhat because of the mechanical arrangement of the rail portion <b>204</b> as a whole, because of the mechanical connection between rail portion <b>204</b> and the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, because of the mechanical hinge arrangement <b>220</b> and because of the mechanical frame assembly <b>206</b>. In light of the above three factors, the chances that rail portion <b>204</b> closely confronts the upper face of the mattress <b>16</b> at first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> are maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows rail portion <b>204</b> swung downwardly relative to the leg portion <b>202</b>. When the bed rail <b>200</b> is not in use, such as during daytime hours, the rail portion <b>204</b> is swung downwardly by disengaging rollers <b>272</b> from slots <b>270</b> on the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and pivoting the rail portion <b>204</b> as a whole against the first side <b>26</b> of the box spring <b>18</b>. When swung downwardly, side rails <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> confront stops <b>460</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) of sleeve or receptor <b>246</b>. To place the rail portion <b>204</b> into the upright operating position, rail portion <b>204</b> is swung upwardly such that rollers <b>272</b> roll against peripheral surface <b>294</b> and such that rollers <b>272</b> then snap into detents <b>270</b> under pressure from the coil springs <b>282</b> whereupon the rail portion <b>204</b> is locked relative to the leg portion <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows that tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be swung from the downward position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, to the upright operating position shown by first arrowhead <b>462</b>, to the folded position shown by second arrowhead <b>464</b> such that tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be swung through about a 270 degree arc relative to leg portion <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref>, <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C show the preferred embodiment for button <b>402</b> (and for button <b>436</b>). Button <b>402</b> includes the tapering face <b>158</b> and the vertical face <b>160</b>. Button <b>402</b> further includes a second vertical face <b>470</b> opposite of vertical face <b>160</b> and running generally parallel thereto. Button <b>402</b> is a spring that during manufacture is slid into base leg section <b>250</b> and does not need to be affixed to base leg section <b>250</b>. More specifically, button <b>402</b> includes a spring <b>472</b> having a base arm <b>474</b> and an upper arm <b>476</b>. Upper arm <b>476</b> includes a head <b>478</b>. Head <b>478</b> includes the vertical surfaces <b>160</b>, <b>470</b> and the tapering surface <b>158</b>. Head <b>478</b> further includes an upper surface <b>480</b> with which a finger may make contact to depress the head <b>478</b>. From a top view, head <b>478</b> is round, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Vertical surface <b>160</b> of head <b>478</b> can extend through opening <b>480</b> in base leg section <b>250</b> and can further extend through opening <b>412</b> in section <b>406</b>. Vertical surface <b>470</b> of head <b>478</b> can extend through opening <b>480</b> in base leg section <b>250</b> and cannot extend through opening <b>412</b> in section <b>406</b>. Tapering surface <b>158</b> of head <b>478</b> cannot extend through opening <b>480</b> in base leg section <b>250</b> when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended (not depressed) and can extend through opening <b>412</b> in section <b>406</b> when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended (not depressed). In other words, when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended, the intersection or juncture of tapering surface <b>158</b> and vertical surface <b>470</b> is disposed about at the juncture of the upper outer surface of base leg section <b>250</b> and the lower inner surface of section <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> shows that when one attempts to increase the length of leg portion <b>202</b>, a portion of section <b>406</b> forming slot <b>412</b> brings pressure to bear upon vertical surface <b>160</b> of head <b>478</b>, which in turn may slide the button <b>402</b> toward the opposite edge of opening <b>480</b> until vertical surface <b>470</b> of head <b>478</b> abuts such opposite edge of opening <b>480</b> formed in base leg section <b>250</b>, which prevents further sliding of the section <b>406</b> relative to base leg <b>250</b> in the direction of sliding that was attempted. Such further sliding is permitted only by depressing button <b>402</b> by an outside object such as a finger, wherein button <b>402</b> is depressed into base leg section <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> shows that sliding in the other direction (the direction opposite to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>) is permitted, without a finger depressing the button <b>402</b>. Here, upon sliding in such opposite direction, a portion of section <b>406</b> forming slot <b>412</b> brings pressure to bear upon tapering surface <b>158</b>, which automatically depresses the head <b>478</b> into base leg section <b>250</b> and permits such sliding to continue. Accordingly, length of leg portion <b>402</b> is decreased with a minimal amount of effort.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As noted above, button <b>436</b> includes the same structure as button <b>402</b>. Hence, button <b>436</b> includes the second vertical surface <b>470</b> opposite of vertical surface <b>160</b>. However, whereas tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>402</b> faces the direction of counters <b>414</b> and <b>440</b>, tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>436</b> faces the direction of the rail portion <b>204</b>. Thus, with counter attachment <b>420</b>, decreasing the length of a leg of leg portion <b>202</b> is relatively easy, because section <b>422</b> encounters the tapering side <b>158</b> of button <b>402</b> when being pushed onto base leg section <b>250</b> and because the tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>436</b> encounters the slot edges of slots <b>432</b> when section <b>424</b> is being pushed onto section <b>422</b>. Conversely, increasing the length of counter attachment <b>420</b> is relatively difficult because the vertical surfaces <b>160</b> and <b>470</b> are encountered.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In operation, the bed rail <b>200</b> is removed from the factory provided box or bag with the fabric wall <b>370</b> already engaged to the frame assembly <b>206</b>. Then tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may be engaged to each other and further engaged in their respective cradles <b>254</b> to hold the lower end portions of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> in a spaced apart rigid relationship via the absolute ends of the tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> confronting and abutting the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>. Then base leg sections <b>250</b> may be swung such that rollers <b>272</b> engage detents <b>270</b> and such that base leg sections <b>250</b> are set at an acute angle relative to rail portion <b>204</b>. Base leg sections <b>250</b> may then be tucked into the first side <b>26</b> of the bed <b>24</b> between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b>. Then either of the counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b> is engaged to the base leg sections <b>250</b> by sliding the counter attachment into the second side <b>28</b> of the bed <b>24</b> between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b> until the counter attachments <b>404</b> (or <b>420</b>) meets with and is engaged to base leg section <b>250</b>. (If counter attachment <b>420</b> is used, medial section <b>422</b> may be first attached to the base leg section <b>250</b> or may be first attached to counter section <b>424</b>). Here, it should be noted that, since slots <b>412</b>, <b>432</b> are provided on only one side of the counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b>, the counter <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>) can not be locked into the downward position, such as against box spring <b>18</b>. Then, with the mattress <b>16</b> between the upright and locked rail portion <b>204</b> and the counter <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>), the counter <b>414</b> and rail portion <b>204</b> are pushed relatively toward each other until the mattress <b>16</b> is tightly hugged and until the rail portion <b>204</b> abuts the upper surface of the mattress <b>16</b> at the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b> such that no gap exists therebetween and a person may safely sleep upon the mattress <b>16</b>. During daytime hours, the rail portion <b>204</b> may be swung down to the out-of-the-way position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and then swung upwardly at bedtime to the upright operating and locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. To make the effective length of the leg portion <b>202</b> greater, a relative great amount of effort is required. Mattress <b>16</b> must be taken off of the leg portion <b>204</b> or access must otherwise be gained to buttons <b>402</b> (or <b>402</b> and <b>436</b>) and then buttons <b>402</b> (or <b>436</b>) must be repeatedly depressed as section <b>406</b> (or <b>424</b>) is drawn out of its cooperating leg section and drawn away from rail portion <b>204</b>. To fold the bed rail <b>200</b>, lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are removed from their cradles <b>254</b> and the counter attachments <b>404</b> (or <b>420</b>) are removed from their base leg sections <b>250</b>. Rollers <b>272</b> are unlocked from their detents <b>270</b> and base leg sections <b>250</b> are swung up to be parallel to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Then hinge mechanism <b>220</b> is unlocked by unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> such that upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may be swung to confront and be parallel with side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the pair of base leg sections <b>250</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, whereby six tubes are generally parallel with each other.</p>

As well as plastic body <b>536</b>, height adjustment mechanism <b>534</b> includes a pin <b>538</b> that ties the plastic body <b>538</b> to side tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. In some cases, pin <b>538</b> is selected to be a set screw that bites into the outer surface of tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>, and each of the height adjustment mechanisms <b>534</b> may have a pair of set pins opposing each other. In other cases, pin <b>538</b> may be a permanent or removable rivet that passes diametrically through tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. In other cases, pin <b>538</b> may be a removable screw that passes diametrically through tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>, where tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> have a number of openings <b>540</b> at different heights. Height adjustment mechanism <b>534</b>, including plastic body <b>536</b>, pin <b>538</b> and openings <b>540</b>, may be referred to as a second quick connect.

Such a rigid feature further maximizes the closing off of any gap that is formed between bed rail <b>500</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Tubing <b>522</b> makes the wall <b>502</b> rigid at a selected location below, yet relatively close to, the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>. Such a further rigid feature even further maximizes the closing off of any gap that is formed between bed rail <b>500</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Further, multiple sleeve <b>514</b> has relatively great rigidity overall with tubing <b>518</b> and adjacent tubing <b>522</b>.

The provision of this space <b>552</b> maximizes the flow of air and thus oxygen to any gap that would be formed between bed rail <b>550</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Each of bed rails <b>500</b> and <b>550</b> may include a peripheral strap <b>560</b> for even further minimizing any gap that may be formed between a bed rail and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> by drawing bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b>, or more particularly the wall <b>502</b>, against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. Mattress <b>16</b> includes a periphery <b>562</b>. Mattress periphery <b>562</b> includes the first side <b>26</b>, which runs into a head side or end <b>564</b>, which runs into the second side <b>28</b>, which runs into the foot side <b>566</b>, which runs into the first side <b>26</b>. Peripheral strap <b>560</b> engages each of sides <b>26</b>, <b>564</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>566</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Peripheral strap <b>560</b> further includes a locking buckle <b>568</b> for engaging opposite ends of strap <b>560</b> and for drawing wall <b>502</b> against the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. The ends of strap <b>560</b> and locking buckle <b>568</b> may be oriented at a number of positions, such as on the second side <b>28</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, or on the outer face <b>570</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b>, or on the head side <b>564</b> or foot side <b>566</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, or adjacent to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Peripheral strap <b>560</b> is preferably engaged to the wall <b>502</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> instead of to the frame such as to tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, though connection to the frame is possible. The reason why engagement of strap <b>560</b> directly to the wall <b>502</b> is preferred is to draw features of the wall <b>502</b>, such as tubing <b>518</b> and tubing <b>522</b>, directly to the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. One means of such an engagement is to avoid wrapping strap <b>560</b> about the outer faces of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and instead run the strap <b>560</b> across the inner faces of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Strap <b>560</b> is engaged to the wall <b>502</b> preferably with a weaving engagement utilizing slots <b>572</b> formed in multiple sleeve <b>514</b>. Slots <b>572</b> are preferably located in and between tubing <b>518</b> and tubing <b>522</b>. Slots <b>572</b> are preferably elongate in height such that strap <b>560</b> may be located relatively close to or relatively far from tubing <b>518</b>. A weave engagement between strap <b>560</b> and wall <b>502</b> is preferred because such an engagement is dependent less upon a stitching or gluing or welding engagement that may disengage from the wall <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">It should be noted that bed rails <b>500</b> and <b>550</b>, except as noted above, otherwise include the features of bed rail <b>200</b>, including the features of leg portion <b>202</b> and rail portion <b>204</b>. However, peripheral strap <b>560</b> is a counter such that the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> may or may not be used in combination with peripheral strap <b>560</b>. It can be appreciated that counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> work directly on the frame (such as side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>) of the bed rail <b>200</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>550</b> while the counter or strap <b>560</b> works directly on what is within the frame of the bed rail <b>200</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>550</b> such that counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b> may work in combination with counter or strap <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">As noted above, strap <b>560</b> is engaged to the wall <b>502</b> of the bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> and runs between side tubes or portions <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. In other words, the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> include first faces that are oriented toward the direction in which leg portion <b>202</b> extends from wall <b>502</b>, and the strap <b>560</b> confronts these inner first faces of the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, when the strap <b>560</b> is engaged on the mattress <b>16</b> such that the wall <b>502</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> is directly drawn against the mattress <b>16</b> and such that side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are indirectly drawn against the mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">If desired, the strap <b>560</b> may confront the opposite face of tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> (i.e., the face opposite the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>) such that the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the frame of the bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> are drawn directly against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b> and such that the wall <b>502</b> is indirectly drawn against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. However, such is not preferred because such a structure may leverage the wall <b>502</b> out away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows that the preferred angle A (the angle between the leg portion and the rail portion) positions tubing <b>522</b> slightly away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, positions tubing <b>518</b> directly against the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> so as to shut off any gap extending in a plane from said sleeping surface <b>519</b>, and positions tubing <b>208</b> inwardly of the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> where first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> defines a plane. Where the leg portions and rail portions have a greater acute angle, i.e. closer to a right angle relationship, tubing <b>522</b> may be set more closely to or directly against first side <b>26</b>. In other words, tubing <b>208</b>, <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> are generally in a common plane that intersects a plane defined by the first side <b>26</b> at a single line, with such single line being in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and with tubing <b>518</b> preferably being co-axial with such line.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">It can be appreciated that the sleeves <b>516</b> and <b>520</b> are elongate in height such that tubing <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> can be disposed at various heights via the second quick connect <b>534</b> while minimizing a change in the layout or form of sheeting <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The length of tubing <b>518</b> is about the distance between side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> and such entire length lies in the plane <b>519</b> of the sleeping surface of mattress <b>16</b>. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed above such plane, then a gap may form in the plane and below such plane. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed below such plane, then a gap may form in the plane and below the plane to the height of the tubing <b>518</b>. If such entire length is broken, then a gap may form at the discontinuous portion. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed at an angle relative to the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>, then a gap is generated at all locations except where the tubing <b>518</b> breaks the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>.</p>
