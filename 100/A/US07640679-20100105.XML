<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to footwear. The invention concerns, more particularly, an article of footwear having a midsole element that defines a void and bores extending through the midsole element to the void.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional article of athletic footwear includes two primary elements, an upper and a sole structure. The upper provides a covering for the foot that securely receives and positions the foot with respect to the sole structure. In addition, the upper may have a configuration that protects the foot and provides ventilation, thereby cooling the foot and removing perspiration. The sole structure is secured to a lower surface of the upper and is generally positioned between the foot and the ground. In addition to attenuating ground reaction forces (i.e., imparting cushioning), the sole structure may provide traction and control foot motions, such as pronation. Accordingly, the upper and the sole structure operate cooperatively to provide a comfortable structure that is suited for a variety of ambulatory activities, such as walking and running.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sole structure of athletic footwear generally exhibits a layered configuration that includes a comfort-enhancing insole, a resilient midsole formed from a polymer foam material, and a ground-contacting outsole that provides both abrasion-resistance and traction. In some articles of footwear, the midsole is the primary sole structure element that imparts cushioning and controls foot motions. Suitable polymer foam materials for the midsole include ethylvinylacetate or polyurethane that compress resiliently under an applied load to attenuate ground reaction forces. Conventional polymer foam materials are resiliently compressible, in part, due to the inclusion of a plurality of open or closed cells that define an inner volume substantially displaced by gas. The polymer foam materials of the midsole may also absorb energy when compressed during ambulatory activities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The midsole may be formed from a unitary element of polymer foam that extends throughout the length and width of the footwear. With the exception of a thickness differential between the heel and forefoot areas of the footwear, such a midsole exhibits substantially uniform properties in each area of the sole structure. In order to vary the properties of midsole, some conventional midsoles incorporate dual-density polymer foams. More particularly, a lateral side of the midsole may be formed from a first foam material, and the medial side of the midsole may be formed from a second, less-compressible foam material. Another manner of varying the properties of the midsole involves the use of stability devices that resist pronation. Examples of stability devices include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,255,877 to Bowerman; 4,288,929 to Norton et al.; 4,354,318 to Frederick et al.; 4,364,188 to Turner et al.; 4,364,189 to Bates; and 5,247,742 to Kilgore et al.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another manner of varying the properties of the midsole involves the use of fluid-filled bladders. U.S. Pat. No. 4,183,156 to Rudy, discloses an inflatable insert formed of elastomeric materials. The insert includes a plurality of tubular chambers that extend substantially longitudinally throughout the length of the footwear. The chambers are in fluid communication with each other and jointly extend across the width of the footwear. U.S. Pat. No. 4,219,945 to Rudy discloses an inflated insert encapsulated in a polymer foam material. The combination of the insert and the encapsulating polymer foam material functions as the midsole. Examples of additional fluid-filled bladders for footwear include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,906,502 and 5,083,361, both to Rudy, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,993,585 and 6,119,371, both to Goodwin et al.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is an article of footwear having an upper and a sole structure secured to the upper. The sole structure includes a midsole element that may be formed of unitary construction from a polymer foam material. A void is defined in the midsole element, and the void extends substantially vertically through a central area of the polymer foam material. The void also extends between an upper surface and a lower surface of the midsole element to define an interior surface. A plurality of bores are also defined in the midsole element. The bores extend substantially horizontally through the polymer foam material, and the bores extend between an exterior surface of the midsole element and the void.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments of the invention, one or more of the bores have a substantially constant width dimension. Two or more of the bores may also have the same width dimension. In some embodiments, the bores may be formed such that unequal numbers of the bores are formed in a lateral side and a medial side of the midsole element. For example, the lateral side may form three bores, whereas the medial side forms two bores. Alternately, the lateral side may form two bores, whereas the medial side forms three bores.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bores may form columns in the midsole element. In some embodiments, unequal numbers of the columns are formed in the lateral side and the medial side. One or more of the columns may also form a substantially vertical cavity, and some of the columns may not form a cavity. In addition, a column may form two or more cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The advantages and features of novelty characterizing the present invention are pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. To gain an improved understanding of the advantages and features of novelty, however, reference may be made to the following descriptive matter and accompanying drawings that describe and illustrate various embodiments and concepts related to the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following discussion and accompanying figures disclose various articles of footwear having a sole element in accordance with the present invention. Concepts related to sole element are disclosed with reference to footwear having configurations that are suitable for various athletic activities, including running, training, and walking, for example. The invention is not solely limited to articles of footwear designed for running, training, and walking, however, and may be applied to a wide range of athletic footwear styles that include basketball shoes, hiking shoes, tennis shoes, volleyball shoes, soccer shoes, and football shoes, for example. In addition to athletic footwear, concepts related to the invention may be applied to footwear that is generally considered to be non-athletic (e.g., dress shoes, sandals, and work boots) or footwear serving a medical or rehabilitative purpose. Accordingly, one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the concepts disclosed herein apply to a wide variety of footwear styles, in addition to the specific footwear styles discussed in the following material and depicted in the accompanying figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Article of footwear <b>100</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes an upper <b>110</b> and a sole structure <b>120</b> that are suitable for a variety of athletic activities, including running, for example. Upper <b>110</b> has a generally conventional configuration incorporating a plurality material elements (e.g., textiles, foam, and leather) that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form an interior void for securely and comfortably receiving a foot. The material elements may be selected and located with respect to upper <b>110</b> in order to selectively impart properties of durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort, for example. In addition, upper <b>110</b> may include a lace that is utilized in a conventional manner to modify the dimensions of the interior void, thereby securing the foot within the interior void and facilitating entry and removal of the foot from the interior void. The lace may extend through apertures in upper <b>110</b>, and a tongue portion of upper <b>110</b> may extend between the interior void and the lace. Accordingly, upper <b>110</b> may exhibit a substantially conventional configuration within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For reference purposes in the following material, footwear <b>100</b> may be divided into three general regions: a forefoot region <b>101</b>, a midfoot region <b>102</b>, and a heel region <b>103</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Forefoot region <b>101</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>100</b> corresponding with the toes and the joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot region <b>102</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>100</b> corresponding with the arch area of the foot, and heel region <b>103</b> corresponds with rear portions of the foot, including the calcaneus bone. Footwear <b>100</b> also includes a lateral side <b>104</b> and a medial side <b>105</b>. Regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> are not intended to demarcate precise areas of footwear <b>100</b>. Rather, regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> are intended to represent general areas of footwear <b>100</b> to aid in the following discussion. In addition to footwear <b>100</b> generally, references to the various regions <b>100</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> may also be applied to upper <b>110</b>, sole structure <b>120</b>, and individual elements thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Sole structure <b>120</b> is secured to a lower area of upper <b>110</b> and is generally positioned between upper <b>110</b> and the ground, thereby extending between the foot and the ground. The primary elements of sole structure <b>120</b> are a plate <b>121</b>, a midsole <b>122</b>, and an outsole <b>123</b>. In addition, sole structure <b>120</b> may incorporate an insole (not depicted) that is positioned within the interior void in upper <b>110</b> and located to correspond with a plantar (i.e., lower) surface of the foot, thereby enhancing the comfort of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Plate <b>121</b> extends between upper <b>110</b> and midsole <b>122</b> in at least heel region <b>103</b> and portions of midfoot region <b>102</b>. Plate <b>121</b> exhibits a generally concave configuration to conform with the shape of the heel area of the foot, and plate <b>121</b> may form an upward protrusion in midfoot region <b>102</b> to support the arch area of the foot. Suitable materials for plate <b>121</b> include a variety of semi-rigid polymer materials, such as nylon and polyether block amide. Although plate <b>121</b> is depicted as having a generally concave configuration, plate <b>121</b> may also be planar or have other shapes within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Midsole <b>122</b> is at least partially formed from a pair of midsole elements <b>124</b> and <b>130</b> that attenuate ground reaction forces (i.e., impart cushioning) and may control foot motions, such as pronation. Midsole element <b>124</b> is positioned in forefoot region <b>101</b> and extends into midfoot region <b>102</b>. Similarly, midsole element <b>130</b> is positioned in heel region <b>103</b> and extends into midfoot region <b>102</b>. Accordingly, midsole elements <b>124</b> and <b>130</b> effectively extend throughout the longitudinal length of footwear <b>100</b> (i.e., through each of regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b>), with plate <b>121</b> extending between midsole elements <b>124</b> and <b>130</b>. Whereas midsole element <b>124</b> is secured directly to upper <b>110</b>, midsole element <b>130</b> is secured to plate <b>121</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, however, plate <b>121</b> may be absent such that midsole element <b>130</b> is secured directly to upper <b>110</b>. Alternately, plate <b>121</b> may extend through the longitudinal length of footwear <b>100</b> such that each of midsole elements <b>124</b> and <b>130</b> are directly secured to plate <b>121</b>. Suitable materials for midsole <b>122</b> include one or more polymer foam materials, such as ethylvinylacetate or polyurethane, that compress resiliently under an applied load to impart cushioning. The polymer foam materials forming midsole <b>122</b> may also absorb energy when compressed during ambulatory activities.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Outsole <b>123</b> is secured to a lower area of midsole <b>122</b> (i.e., to both of midsole elements <b>124</b> and <b>130</b>) to form a lower surface of footwear <b>100</b>, and outsole <b>123</b> extends through the longitudinal length of footwear <b>100</b>. Suitable materials for outsole <b>123</b> include a variety of abrasion-resistant materials, such as carbon black rubber compound, that are textured to provide traction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The structure of midsole element <b>130</b> will now be discussed in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7B</figref>. Midsole element <b>130</b> is formed of unitary (i.e., one-piece) construction from a single density polymer foam material, but may also be formed from multiple elements that are joined together. In other embodiments, midsole element <b>130</b> may be formed to exhibit areas of different densities. For example, the portion of midsole element <b>130</b> in lateral side <b>104</b> may be formed from a more compressible foam than the portion of midsole element <b>130</b> in medial side <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Midsole element <b>130</b> forms four primary surfaces that include: an upper surface <b>131</b>, a lower surface <b>132</b>, an exterior surface <b>133</b>, and an interior surface <b>134</b>. Upper surface <b>131</b> has a generally concave shape that corresponds with the shape of plate <b>121</b>, and upper surface <b>131</b> is positioned adjacent to plate <b>121</b> and secured to plate <b>121</b>, with an adhesive, for example. In other embodiments, upper surface <b>131</b> may be planar or exhibit another shape. Lower surface <b>132</b> is positioned opposite upper surface <b>131</b> and has a generally planar configuration that joins with outsole <b>123</b>. The rear-lateral area of lower surface <b>132</b> may have a bevel that facilitates contact between footwear <b>100</b> and the ground during the running cycle, as discussed in greater detail below. Exterior surface <b>133</b> extends between upper surface <b>131</b> and lower surface <b>132</b> to form an exterior of midsole element <b>130</b>, thereby facing outward from footwear <b>100</b>. The figures depict exterior surface <b>133</b> as having a generally smooth configuration, but exterior surface <b>133</b> may also exhibit a textured or ribbed configuration that enhances the compression properties of midsole element <b>130</b>. Interior surface <b>134</b> also extends between upper surface <b>131</b> and lower surface <b>132</b>, but is positioned on an interior of midsole element <b>130</b> to define a generally elliptical interior void <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Interior void <b>135</b> extends vertically through midsole element <b>130</b> and between upper surface <b>131</b> and lower surface <b>132</b>. Although the shape of interior void <b>135</b> may vary significantly within the scope of the present invention, interior void <b>135</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> as having a generally elliptical configuration. In other embodiments, interior void <b>135</b> may be round, rectangular, or triangular, for example, or interior void <b>135</b> may have an irregular shape. Outsole <b>123</b> may define an aperture that corresponds with the position of interior void <b>135</b>, thereby exposing plate <b>121</b> from a bottom of footwear <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, outsole <b>123</b> may extend over the area of midsole element <b>130</b> that corresponds with interior void <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition to interior void <b>135</b>, which extends vertically between upper surface <b>131</b> and lower surface <b>132</b>, midsole element <b>130</b> also includes five bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>that extend horizontally between exterior surface <b>133</b> and interior surface <b>134</b>. More particularly, bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>c </i>extend through lateral side <b>104</b>, and bores <b>136</b><i>d</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>extend through medial side <b>105</b>. Bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>are depicted in the figures as extending through upper surface <b>131</b> to form a plurality of individual columns <b>137</b> that contact and support portions of plate <b>121</b>. In other embodiments, however, bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>may form discrete and continuous apertures in midsole element <b>130</b> that do not break the continuity of upper surface <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>exhibit substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b> from exterior surface <b>133</b> to interior surface <b>134</b>. That is, the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>do not increase or decrease substantially between exterior surface <b>133</b> and interior surface <b>134</b>. In other words, bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>are not depicted as tapering inward or flaring outward in the figures. In other embodiments of the invention, the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>may vary between exterior surface <b>133</b> and interior surface <b>134</b>. The substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>from exterior surface <b>133</b> to interior surface <b>134</b> impart a generally trapezoidal shape to each of columns <b>137</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. More particularly, the lack of inward tapering and outward flaring in the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>imparts a generally trapezoidal shape to the portions of upper surface <b>131</b> associated with the various columns <b>137</b>, but the specific shape of upper surface <b>131</b> may vary considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another feature of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>relates to the relative dimensions of each of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e</i>. As discussed above, bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>exhibit substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b>. In addition, the width dimension <b>106</b> of each of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension <b>106</b> of other bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e</i>. More particularly, the width dimension of bore <b>136</b><i>a </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension of bore <b>136</b><i>c</i>, and the width dimension of bore <b>136</b><i>b </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension of bore <b>136</b><i>d</i>, for example. In other embodiments of the invention, the relative width dimensions of the various bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The relative number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>through lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and the resulting number of columns <b>137</b>, are selected to correspond with a common motion of the foot during running, which proceeds as follows: Initially, the heel strikes the ground, followed by the ball of the foot. As the heel leaves the ground, the foot rolls forward so that the toes make contact, and finally the entire foot leaves the ground to begin another cycle. During the time that the foot is in contact with the ground and rolling forward, it also rolls from the outside or lateral side to the inside or medial side, a process called pronation. While the foot is air-borne and preparing for another cycle, the opposite process, called supination, occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Footwear <b>100</b> may be structured to exhibit lesser compressibility on medial side <b>105</b> when compared with lateral side <b>104</b> in order to limit the degree of pronation in the foot. In other words, medial side <b>105</b> is less compressible to resist medial roll in the foot. The lesser compressibility of medial side <b>105</b> is imparted through the relative number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>through lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and the resulting number of columns <b>137</b>. More particularly, three bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>c </i>extend through lateral side <b>104</b>, and two bores <b>136</b><i>d</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>extend through medial side <b>105</b>. The difference in the number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>forms a differential in the compressibility of lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. That is, lateral side <b>104</b> is more compressible than medial side <b>105</b> due to the difference in the number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Differences in the degree of compressibility between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b> are at least partially dependent upon various factors, including the dimensions of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e</i>, the number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e</i>, and the properties of the material forming midsole element <b>130</b>. Differences in the degree of compressibility between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b> may also be controlled through the formation of one or more cavities <b>138</b> in one or more columns <b>137</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, the column <b>137</b> positioned in medial side <b>105</b> defines two cavities <b>138</b>, where as the columns <b>137</b> positioned in lateral side <b>104</b> do not define cavities <b>138</b>. Accordingly, only selected columns <b>137</b> may incorporate cavities <b>138</b>, and in some embodiments no columns <b>137</b> may incorporate cavities <b>138</b>. Cavities <b>138</b> are depicted as being substantially vertical, but may have other orientations. In addition, cavities <b>138</b> may extend through lower surface <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although medial side <b>105</b> is intended to have lesser compressibility than lateral side <b>104</b>, cavities <b>138</b> may increase the compressibility of medial side <b>105</b> to further tune the difference in compressibility between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. A pair of cavities <b>138</b> are also formed in the column <b>137</b> that forms a rear area of midsole element <b>130</b>. These cavities <b>138</b> may decrease the compressibility of midsole element <b>130</b> in the area of sole structure <b>120</b> that compresses during the initial contact between footwear <b>100</b> and the ground during the running cycle. The various cavities <b>138</b> are depicted as not extending through lower surface <b>132</b>, but may extend through one or both of surfaces <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> in further embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The polymer foam material of midsole element <b>130</b>, as depicted in the figures, encompasses approximately two-thirds of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and a dimension <b>107</b> across interior void <b>135</b> (also in the direction between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>) encompasses approximately one-third of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. As depicted in the figures, therefore, the ratio of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b> to dimension <b>107</b> is approximately 3:1. In further embodiments of the invention, the ratio may vary significantly, but will generally be in a range of 1.5:1 to 9:1. Accordingly, the ratio will generally be greater than 1.5:1 and may be, therefore 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">An indentation <b>139</b> circumscribes at least a portion of interior surface <b>134</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B. Indentation <b>139</b> also affects the compressibility of midsole element <b>130</b>. In effect, indentation <b>139</b> increases the compressibility of the portions of midsole element <b>130</b> that are adjacent to interior surface <b>134</b>. That is, indentation <b>139</b> increases the compressibility of central areas of midsole element <b>130</b> relative to outer areas, which may promote stability in footwear <b>100</b>. As depicted in the figures, indentation <b>139</b> exhibits a semi-circular configuration, but indentation <b>139</b> may have a variety of configurations within the scope of the present invention. Although indentation <b>139</b> is depicted as extending around substantially all of midsole element <b>139</b>, indentation <b>139</b> may be limited to heel region <b>103</b> or may be absent is some embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, midsole element <b>130</b> tapers downward from the rearward areas to the areas that are positioned in midfoot region <b>102</b>. The heel areas of some articles of footwear are at a greater elevation than forefoot areas, particularly in athletic footwear. The downward taper facilitates this configuration in footwear <b>100</b>. In addition, the downward taper forms a wedge-shaped portion of midsole element <b>130</b> that extends between plate <b>121</b> and outsole <b>123</b> in midfoot region <b>102</b> and is generally positioned under the arch area of the foot.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Midsole element <b>130</b> is depicted as being positioned in heel region <b>103</b> and extending into midfoot region <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Based upon the above discussion, midsole element <b>130</b> incorporates a variety of features.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The above discussion of footwear <b>100</b> provides an example of the various configurations that are suitable for midsole element <b>130</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Midsole element <b>140</b> forms four primary surfaces that include: an upper surface <b>141</b>, a lower surface <b>142</b>, an exterior surface <b>143</b>, and an interior surface <b>144</b>.

The figures depict exterior surface <b>153</b> as having a generally smooth configuration, but exterior surface <b>153</b> may also exhibit a textured or ribbed configuration that enhances the compression properties of midsole element <b>150</b>. Upper surface <b>151</b> has a generally concave shape that corresponds with the shape of plate <b>121</b>, and upper surface <b>151</b> is positioned adjacent to plate <b>121</b> and secured to plate <b>121</b>, with an adhesive, for example. Lower surface <b>152</b> is positioned opposite upper surface <b>151</b> and has a generally planar configuration that joins with outsole <b>123</b>. Exterior surface <b>153</b> extends between upper surface <b>151</b> and lower surface <b>152</b> to form an exterior of midsole element <b>150</b>, thereby facing outward from footwear <b>100</b>. Interior surface <b>154</b> also extends between upper surface <b>151</b> and lower surface <b>152</b>, but is positioned on an interior of midsole element <b>150</b> to define a generally elliptical interior void <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Interior void <b>155</b> extends vertically through midsole element <b>150</b> and between upper surface <b>151</b> and lower surface <b>152</b>. Although the shape of interior void <b>155</b> may vary significantly within the scope of the present invention, interior void <b>155</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> as having a generally elliptical configuration. In other embodiments, interior void <b>155</b> may be round, rectangular, or triangular, for example, or interior void <b>155</b> may have an irregular shape. Outsole <b>123</b> may form an aperture that corresponds with the position of interior void <b>155</b>, thereby exposing plate <b>121</b> from a bottom of footwear <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, outsole <b>123</b> may extend over the area of midsole element <b>150</b> that corresponds with interior void <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to interior void <b>155</b>, which extends vertically between upper surface <b>151</b> and lower surface <b>152</b>, midsole element <b>150</b> also includes four bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>that extend horizontally between exterior surface <b>153</b> and interior surface <b>154</b>. More particularly, bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>b </i>extend through lateral side <b>104</b>, and bores <b>156</b><i>c</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>extend through medial side <b>105</b>. Bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>are depicted in the figures as extending through upper surface <b>151</b> to form a plurality of individual columns <b>157</b> that contact and support portions of plate <b>121</b>. In other embodiments, however, bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>may form discrete and continuous apertures in midsole element <b>150</b> that do not break the continuity of upper surface <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>exhibit substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b> from exterior surface <b>153</b> to interior surface <b>154</b>. That is, the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>do not increase or decrease substantially between exterior surface <b>153</b> and interior surface <b>154</b>. In other words, bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>are not depicted as tapering inward or flaring outward in the figures. In other embodiments of the invention, the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>may vary between exterior surface <b>153</b> and interior surface <b>154</b>. The substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>from exterior surface <b>153</b> to interior surface <b>154</b> impart a generally trapezoidal shape to each of columns <b>157</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. More particularly, the lack of inward tapering and outward flaring in the width dimensions <b>106</b> of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>imparts a generally trapezoidal shape to the portions of upper surface <b>151</b> associated with the various columns <b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another feature of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e </i>relates to the relative dimensions of each of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e</i>. As discussed above, bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e </i>exhibit substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b>. In addition, the width dimension <b>106</b> of each of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension <b>106</b> of other bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e</i>. More particularly, the width dimension of bore <b>156</b><i>a </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension of bore <b>156</b><i>c</i>, and the width dimension of bore <b>156</b><i>b </i>is substantially similar to the width dimension of bore <b>156</b><i>d</i>, for example. In other embodiments of the invention, the relative width dimensions of the various bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>e </i>may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The relative number of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>through lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and the resulting number of columns <b>157</b>, are selected to impart a compressibility to portions of midsole element <b>150</b> that is advantageous during walking activities. During walking activities, the degree of pronation in the foot is significantly reduced when compared with the degree of pronation during the running cycle. Accordingly, midsole element <b>150</b> may exhibit an equal number of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>on each of lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. That is, midsole element <b>150</b> may have a substantially symmetrical shape that does not impart differences in the degree of compressibility between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As with midsole elements <b>130</b> and <b>140</b>, one or more cavities <b>158</b> may be formed in one or more columns <b>157</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, for example, the columns <b>157</b> positioned in lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b> each define a single cavity <b>158</b>, and the column <b>157</b> that forms a rear area of midsole element <b>150</b> may define three cavities <b>158</b>. These cavities <b>158</b> may decrease the compressibility of midsole element <b>150</b> in the area of sole structure <b>120</b> that compresses during the initial contact between footwear <b>100</b> and the ground during walking activities. The various cavities <b>158</b> are depicted as not extending through lower surface <b>152</b>, but may extend through one or both of surfaces <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> in further embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The polymer foam material of midsole element <b>150</b>, as depicted in the figures, encompasses approximately two-thirds of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and a dimension <b>107</b> across interior void <b>155</b> (also in the direction between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>) encompasses approximately one-third of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. As depicted in the figures, therefore, the ratio of the distance between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b> to dimension <b>107</b> is approximately 3:1. In further embodiments of the invention, the ratio may vary significantly, but will generally be in a range of 1.5:1 to 9:1. Accordingly, the ratio will generally be greater than 1.5:1 and may be, therefore 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An indentation <b>159</b> circumscribes at least a portion of interior surface <b>154</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B. Indentation <b>159</b> also affects the compressibility of midsole element <b>150</b>. In effect, indentation <b>159</b> increases the compressibility of the portions of midsole element <b>150</b> that are adjacent to interior surface <b>154</b>. That is, indentation <b>159</b> increases the compressibility of central areas of midsole element <b>150</b> relative to outer areas, which may promote stability in footwear <b>100</b>. As depicted in the figures, indentation <b>159</b> exhibits a semi-circular configuration, but indentation <b>159</b> may have a variety of configurations within the scope of the present invention. Although indentation <b>159</b> is depicted as extending around substantially all of midsole element <b>159</b>, indentation <b>159</b> may be limited to heel region <b>103</b> or may be absent is some embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, midsole element <b>150</b> tapers downward from the rearward areas to the areas that are positioned in midfoot region <b>102</b>. The heel areas of some articles of footwear are at a greater elevation than forefoot areas, particularly in athletic footwear. The downward taper facilitates this configuration in footwear <b>100</b>. In addition, the downward taper forms a wedge-shaped portion of midsole element <b>150</b> that extends between plate <b>121</b> and outsole <b>123</b> in midfoot region <b>102</b> and is generally positioned under the arch area of the foot.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Midsole element <b>150</b> is depicted as being positioned in heel region <b>103</b> and extending into midfoot region <b>102</b>. In further embodiments of the invention, midsole element <b>150</b> may be limited to heel region <b>103</b>, or midsole element <b>150</b> may extend into forefoot region <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the concepts disclosed herein may be applied to various areas and components of midsole <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Based upon the above discussion, midsole element <b>150</b> incorporates a variety of features. For example, midsole element <b>150</b> may be formed of unitary construction from a single density foam, but may also be formed from foams of different density. In addition, the number of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>may be the same between lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, and some or all of bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>may exhibit substantially constant width dimensions <b>106</b> from exterior surface <b>153</b> to interior surface <b>154</b>. Bores <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<b>156</b><i>d </i>may also impart a trapezoidal shape to the various columns <b>157</b>. Furthermore, some or all of columns <b>157</b> may define cavities <b>158</b> that further affect the compressibility of specific areas of midsole element <b>150</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each of midsole elements <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b> may be formed of unitary construction from a polymer foam material or another material through a substantially conventional molding process. In molding midsole element <b>130</b>, for example, interior void <b>135</b> may be defined in the polymer foam material so as to extend in a substantially vertical direction and from upper surface <b>131</b> to lower surface <b>132</b>. In addition, bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>may be defined in the polymer foam material so as to extend in a substantially horizontal direction and from exterior surface <b>133</b> to interior void <b>135</b>. Bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b><i>e </i>may be formed to exhibit substantially constant width, and unequal number of bores <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<b>136</b> may be formed in one of lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>. Similar concepts may be applied to each of midsole elements <b>140</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
