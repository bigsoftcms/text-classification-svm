<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to beverage holders, and more particularly to such holders that are adapted to penetrate the ground and hold beverage containers above the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The growing popularity of outdoor concerts has brought to light several problems for picnickers. First, because the ground typically slopes downward toward the stage, bottles, cans and glasses are prone to fall over on the uneven ground thus increasing the chance of beverages being spilled. This is particularly a problem for stemmed glasses, which include a high center of gravity and are thus even more prone to tipping over on sloped surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A second issue is the presentation of such beverages at levels that are comfortable to reach for. Concertgoers, especially those attending concerts at wineries, bring lawn chairs to the events and would often need to grope blindly downward to reach a glass, can, or bottle resting on the ground below.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Finally, prior art systems have been known to be difficult to install and/or flimsy at best.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the need remains for a beverage holder that retains beverages level even on uneven ground, at a desired height, and that can be easily installed for use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides for a beverage support apparatus. The apparatus includes a first elongate body having a first penetrator at a lower end that is capable of piercing the ground in a generally vertical manner. The first elongate body also has a first beverage support provided on its raised end. Further, the apparatus may include a second elongate body, spaced from and arranged in parallel to said first elongate body, which also has penetrator at a lower end capable of piercing the ground in a generally vertical manner and a beverage support provided on its raised end. A high-volume beverage container retaining member is slidably coupled between the first elongate body and second elongate body for vertical movement therealong. The beverage container retaining member has a retaining portion adapted to fit over a top of a beverage container and rest against an outer surface of the beverage container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure further provides for an alternative beverage support apparatus. This apparatus includes an elongate body having a penetrator at a lower end capable of piercing the ground in a generally vertical manner, a beverage support provided on a raised end of the elongate body, and a handle positioned on the elongate body between the penetrator and the beverage support.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure further provides for a method for implementing a beverage holder comprising the steps of: providing a beverage holder having a penetrator, a handle, and a beverage support surface; using the handle, inserting the penetrator into the ground in a generally vertical direction so that the beverage support is elevated above the surface of the ground; and resting a beverage container on the beverage support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention that proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the inventions as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a beverage support apparatus <b>100</b> includes two support elements <b>200</b>, <b>204</b>. First support element <b>200</b> includes a first elongate body <b>102</b>. In one preferred embodiment the first elongate body <b>102</b> is formed of a wire or metal rod and bent into the shape shown, but body <b>102</b> can be made by any means that will fulfill the desired purposes of the apparatus. The first elongate body <b>102</b> should be strong enough to support a beverage container, here shown as wine glass <b>104</b>, without bending or tipping to an extent that the beverage may be spilled.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A first penetrator <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is formed or included at a lower end of the elongate body <b>102</b> and is capable of piercing the ground in a generally vertical manner. The first penetrator <b>106</b> may just be part of the elongate body <b>102</b> in an unaltered form. For example in the wire or steel rod embodiment, the elongate body <b>102</b> would have the capability to pierce the ground without special modifications because of the small cross-section of the wire used and stiffness of the material. It may also be desirable to taper or sharpen the first elongate body <b>102</b> at the lower end <b>106</b> to enable better piercing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A first beverage support <b>108</b> is provided on a raised end of the first elongate body <b>102</b>. In one embodiment the first beverage support <b>108</b> may include an annular support surface <b>109</b> with a gap <b>110</b> formed therein for use with a container <b>104</b>. The wine glass <b>104</b> shown is of a type that includes a bulb with a sloped undersurface <b>105</b> coupled to a stem <b>107</b> and thence to a base <b>122</b>. The annular support surface <b>109</b> and gap <b>110</b> are structured so that the stem <b>107</b> of the glass <b>104</b> may be received through the gap <b>110</b> and the sloped undersurface <b>105</b> of the bulb of the glass <b>104</b> lowered until resting against the annular support surface <b>109</b> with the base <b>122</b> on or suspended above the handle <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one preferred embodiment the beverage support element <b>200</b> may include a handle <b>111</b> affixed to the elongate body <b>102</b>. The handle <b>111</b> may be a loop formed in the plane of the elongate body <b>102</b> whereby a thumb may be received within the loop and used to push the penetrator <b>106</b> into the ground (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In this fashion, the hand and forearm of the user may be inserted down through the circular opening formed within the annular support surface <b>109</b> and the thumb inserted within the handle <b>111</b> so that the webbing of the hand between the thumb and palm pushes down against the lower inside portion of the handle <b>111</b>. If the hand and arm of the user is too large to fit through the circular opening, the thumb may simply be inserted within the handle loop from the outside. Downward force applied to the apparatus beverage support element <b>200</b> in this fashion would then push the elongate body <b>102</b> into the ground as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at any angle &#x3b8; desired, but preferably so that the support element <b>200</b> is in a generally vertical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A second support element <b>204</b>, characterized in a preferred embodiment by a second elongate body <b>112</b>, may be spaced from and arranged in parallel to said first elongate body <b>102</b> by a desired distance <b>113</b>. The second elongate body <b>112</b> may have both a second penetrator at a lower end capable of piercing the ground in a generally vertical manner and second beverage support <b>116</b> provided on a raised end of the second elongate body <b>112</b>. The second elongate body <b>112</b> may be implemented in the manner described above for the first elongate body <b>102</b> as shown, but is not limited to do so.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, a high-volume beverage container retaining member <b>118</b> may be slidably coupled between the first elongate body <b>102</b> and second elongate body <b>112</b> for vertical movement therealong (shown by arrow <b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The beverage container retaining member <b>118</b> may have a retaining portion <b>119</b> adapted to engage the beverage container <b>120</b> on an outer surface of the beverage container <b>120</b>, such as a sloped top surface <b>121</b> of wine bottle <b>120</b> (shown in dashed outline). The retaining portion <b>119</b> of the beverage retaining member <b>118</b> may include a substantially circular periphery as shown, and may also include looped portions <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> that wrap around and slidably receive elongate bodies <b>102</b>, <b>112</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The embodiment of retaining member <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown with overlapping retaining portions <b>119</b>. Including the looped portions <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> allows the retaining member <b>118</b> to slide vertically <b>115</b> along the elongate bodies <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> when the retaining member <b>118</b> is aligned perpendicular with respect to the elongate bodies <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> and to be fixed when the retaining member <b>118</b> is offset from the perpendicular axis. In that case, it may be preferable to have a double loop <b>117</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for better functionality. Double loops <b>117</b> have been found to allow greater frictional contact with upright elongate member <b>102</b> (and the opposing loops with elongate member <b>112</b>) so that the retaining member <b>118</b> may be manually set at a desired height and then stay at that height when released. The retaining portion <b>119</b> may further include a back retaining portion <b>134</b> that spans between the loops <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> and elongate bodies <b>102</b>, <b>112</b>. The shape and size of the retaining portion <b>119</b> may be designed to accommodate any number of beverage container shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The high volume beverage container <b>120</b> (e.g. a wine bottle, 2-liter bottle, etc.) can be inserted through the top of the retaining member <b>118</b> until the bottom of the container rests on the ground. Alternately, the retaining member <b>118</b> can be slid upward and the container <b>120</b> slid underneath and inserted upward through the retaining member opening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention may also be described as a beverage support apparatus <b>100</b> comprising an elongate body <b>102</b> having a penetrator <b>106</b> at a lower end capable of piercing the ground <b>202</b> in a generally vertical manner. The apparatus <b>100</b> also has a beverage support <b>108</b> on a raised end of the elongate body <b>102</b>, and a handle <b>111</b> positioned on the elongate body <b>102</b> between the penetrator <b>106</b> and the beverage support <b>108</b>. This embodiment may also be formed continuously from a single wire or metal rod. Ground <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown sloped to represent the typical topography of an amphitheater where embodiments of the present invention are likely to be used. Penetrator <b>106</b> inserts at an oblique angle &#x3b8; relative to the sloped ground so that the beverage support <b>108</b> defines a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of gravity G.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment for implementing a beverage support <b>400</b>. The support <b>400</b> includes a lower resting portion <b>402</b> and an upper retaining portion <b>404</b>. The upper retaining portion <b>404</b> may be formed with a loop in a plane perpendicular to the elongate body <b>406</b>. The loop on the upper retaining portion <b>402</b> may also include a gap <b>408</b> for receiving a cylindrical beverage container <b>412</b> therethrough where an axis of the elongate body <b>406</b> passes up through the interior of the loop. Gap <b>408</b> preferably has a dimension approximately equal to a width <b>414</b> of container <b>412</b> so that the container can be placed within the device <b>400</b> via the top or, alternately, from the side through gap <b>408</b>. If gap <b>408</b> is sized to be slightly smaller than a diameter than the can <b>412</b>, the resilient opposing ends of the upper retaining portion <b>404</b> spanning the gap <b>408</b> temporarily expand to admit the can, and then snap back to its original dimension so that the can is retained within the device and does not easily slide out.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The upper retaining portion <b>404</b> and the lower resting portion <b>402</b> may be coupled together via a connection member <b>410</b> formed off axis relative to the elongate portion <b>406</b>. This embodiment for a beverage support <b>400</b> may also be included in the continuously formed wire or metal rod embodiment for the elongate body discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An embodiment of the present invention may also be described as a method for implementing a beverage holder <b>100</b> comprising the steps of providing a beverage holder <b>200</b> having a penetrator <b>106</b>, a handle <b>111</b>, and a beverage support surface <b>108</b>; using the handle <b>111</b>, inserting the penetrator <b>106</b> into the ground in a generally vertical direction so that the beverage holder <b>200</b> is elevated above the surface of the ground <b>202</b>; and resting a beverage container <b>104</b> on the beverage support surface <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The beverage support surface in the above method may include an annular surface <b>109</b> with a gap <b>110</b> formed therein and the beverage container <b>104</b> includes a glass having a stem <b>107</b> coupled between an underside <b>105</b> of the glass and a base <b>122</b>, the method further comprising inserting the stem <b>107</b> of the glass through the gap and resting the underside <b>105</b> of the glass on the annular surface <b>109</b> so that the base <b>122</b> of the glass is suspended above the handle <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is to be understood that the above-referenced arrangements are only illustrative of the application for the principles of the present disclosure. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements can be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. While embodiments of the present invention have been shown in the drawings and fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiment(s) of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications can be made without departing from the principles and concepts as set forth herein.
