<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to agricultural implements and, more specifically, to such implement having different sets of vertically adjustable tools including a set of rockshaft mounted tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">During agricultural seeding operations, placing fertilizer in soil at controlled separation from seed helps prevent high fertilizer concentrations from harming the young plants. Machines are available with a machine configuration having separate openers for seed and fertilizer. With many of the separate opener configurations, there is a reduced number of fertilizer openers. Typically there is one fertilizer opener for two seed openers, and the fertilizer application point is approximately equally spaced between the two seed application points. An example of such a machine is the John Deere 1895 Air Drill with two rows of disk-type rockshaft-mounted seed openers combined with one row of disk-type rockshaft-mounted fertilizer openers. Another example is the Bourgault 5710 Air Hoe Drill with shank-type frame-mounted seed openers and frame-mounted disk-type fertilizer openers. Disk-type openers are relatively complex and expensive compared to hoe openers. However, disks tend to have lower draft and higher residue flow capacity. Controlling fertilizer placement depth on frame mounted fertilizer openers can be difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On implements wherein the operating depth of a shank opener is set by the machine frame position, changes in fertilizer placement relative to seed placement require adjustment of the position of a disk-type fertilizer opener relative to the frame. Changes in the disk opener position relative to the frame are also required to raise the disk opener above the ground surface when only the shank openers are in use. Rockshaft mounted openers typically have a limited range of preferred rotational position due to a limited acceptable range of attack angles between the application boot and the soil surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved implement having different sets of tools. It is a further object to provide such an implement which overcomes most or all of the aforementioned problems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is another object of the invention to provide an improved implement having both seeding and fertilizing tools. It is yet another object to provide such an implement which includes front mounted fertilizer openers and rear mounted seeding tools.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved combination fertilizer and seeding implement having disk type fertilizer openers and frame-mounted seeding tools. It is yet another object to provide such an implement with front, rockshaft mounted fertilizer openers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved implement having a frame-mounted rockshaft carrying tools. It is another object to provide such an implement wherein the rockshaft is adjustable vertically relative to the frame for accommodating different ranges of frame operating heights.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Implement construction includes a front section of disk type fertilizer openers and a rear section of frame mounted tools such as seed openers. The openers are connected by drawbars to a rockshaft which is vertically adjustable to accommodate different ranges of operating depths of the frame mounted tools. The construction combines the lower draft, better residue cutting ability and higher residue flow capacity of a disk type opener with the lower cost, lower complexity and wider choice of soil engagement devices of a shank type opener. In addition, since the shank depth is set by frame height, readjustment of operating depth of all shanks can be accomplished easily and rapidly by changing frame height. The vertical adjustability of the rockshaft facilitates a wide range of frame operating heights for different tool depths while maintaining optimum disk opener drawbar angles.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, therein is shown a portion of a multi-section implement <b>10</b> having a main frame <b>12</b> supported by vertically adjustable forward ground wheel assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> for forward movement over a field. Rear ground wheel assemblies <b>20</b>, shown rotated upwardly to the retracted field-working position, are connected to a rear flexible rockshaft <b>22</b> forming part of the frame <b>12</b> and are rockable downwardly relative to the frame <b>12</b> to support the rear of the implement <b>10</b> for transport. Lift linkages <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are connected between the rockshaft <b>22</b> and the wheel assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively. Main lift cylinders <b>30</b> connected between the wheel assemblies <b>20</b> and the frame <b>12</b> rotate the rockshaft <b>22</b> to raise and lower the wheel assemblies <b>14</b>-<b>20</b> relative to the frame. Rear wheel positioning cylinders <b>32</b> are connected between wheel arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the wheel assemblies <b>22</b> to rotate the wheels upwardly (shown) to provide ground clearance for field-working operations and downwardly to provide rear frame support during transport. The cylinders <b>32</b> are plumbed in combination with implement frame cylinders <b>36</b> which fold the implement <b>10</b>. As the cylinders <b>36</b> are retracted to fold sections of the frame <b>12</b> for transport, the cylinders <b>32</b> extend to move the wheel assemblies <b>20</b> downwardly. When the frame sections are unfolded for field-working operations by extending the cylinders <b>36</b>, the cylinders <b>32</b> retract to move the wheel assemblies <b>20</b> upwardly. In the field, the forward wheel assemblies <b>14</b>-<b>18</b> are adjusted vertically with respect to the frame <b>12</b> to change frame height relative to the ground and adjust planting depth, as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown, the implement <b>10</b> is a combination seeding and fertilizing implement having a set of forward fertilizer openers <b>40</b> connected to a forward flexible rockshaft <b>42</b> and rear frame-mounted hoe-type seed openers <b>44</b>. As the frame <b>12</b> is raised and lowered during field-working operations, the operating depth of the seed openers <b>44</b> is adjusted. The forward fertilizer openers <b>40</b> are shown as disk-type openers having drawbars <b>50</b> with upper forward ends connected by lower portions of drawbar brackets <b>52</b> to the rockshaft <b>42</b>. Spring and tension link assemblies <b>54</b> are connected between upper portions of the brackets <b>52</b> and lower rearward ends of the drawbar <b>50</b> to bias the drawbar assembly downwardly during field-working operations and to lift the fertilizer openers <b>40</b> from the ground when the rockshaft <b>42</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction as viewed in the drawings. A motor or rockshaft cylinder <b>60</b> having a rod end connected to a rockshaft bracket <b>62</b> and a base end connected to a frame bracket <b>64</b> rotates the rockshaft <b>42</b> to raise and lower the fertilizer openers <b>40</b> and to adjust the downpressure on the openers when in the field-working position. Angled opener disks <b>70</b> and depth gauging wheels <b>72</b> are mounted on the lower aft ends of the drawbars <b>50</b>. Fertilizer boots <b>74</b> open downwardly on the shadow side of the angled disks <b>70</b> and deposit material in furrows opened by disks <b>70</b>. Trailing closing wheels <b>76</b> supported by inverted U-shaped brackets <b>78</b> from the aft ends of the drawbars <b>50</b> close the furrow and firm the soil over the deposited material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The main frame <b>12</b> includes transverse members or ranks <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>c </i>offset rearwardly of a forward frame member <b>12</b><i>f</i>. The forward frame member <b>12</b><i>f </i>carries adjustable rockshaft support structure <b>80</b> for selectively mounting the rockshaft <b>42</b> at one of a plurality of vertically spaced locations depending on the operating height of the frame <b>12</b> to maintain opener drawbar angle within a desired range. The rear ranks <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c </i>support transversely spaced shank assemblies <b>44</b><i>a </i>with C-shaped shanks having lower ends with hoe-type or other suitable openers <b>44</b><i>b</i>. Seed tubes <b>44</b><i>t </i>connected to a source of seed (not shown) provide seed to furrows opened by the openers <b>44</b><i>b</i>. Gangs of trailing press wheels <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) close and firm soil over the seed furrows. The fertilizer openers <b>40</b> are typically spaced on the rockshaft <b>42</b> to provide fertilizer application points centrally between two adjacent rows of seed. The depth of penetration of the openers <b>44</b><i>b </i>is determined by the height of the frame <b>12</b> above the surface of the ground, and by adjusting the wheel assemblies <b>14</b>-<b>18</b> the planting depth of the entire implement <b>10</b> can be easily changed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The adjustable rockshaft support structure <b>80</b> facilitates vertical adjustment of the rockshaft <b>42</b> relative to the frame <b>12</b> so that the operating range of the angles of the drawbar <b>50</b> are optimized. For example, for relatively deep seeding depth operations, the rockshaft <b>42</b> can be raised relative to the frame to prevent the drawbar angles from decreasing beyond a minimum desired angle. Conversely, for shallower seed opener operations wherein the frame <b>12</b> is in a relatively higher position, the rockshaft can be lowered to maintain the drawbars within the desired operating angle range.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each adjustable rockshaft support structure <b>80</b> includes a frame bracket <b>90</b> supported from the forward frame member <b>12</b><i>f </i>and having a forward slotted wall <b>92</b>. A bearing block support <b>94</b> includes a rear plate <b>96</b> with vertically spaced apertures <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which abuts the slotted wall <b>92</b>. A split bearing block assembly <b>100</b> which rotatably supports the rockshaft <b>42</b> is secured to the back of the slotted wall <b>92</b> and against the plate <b>96</b> by bolts <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, respectively. Bolts <b>110</b> pass through selected sets of the apertures <b>98</b> and apertures in the slotted wall <b>92</b> which align with the apertures <b>98</b>. The set of apertures are selected to position the rockshaft <b>42</b> at the desired vertical location with respect to the frame <b>12</b>. The plate <b>96</b> can be repositioned relative to the slotted wall <b>92</b> to change the vertical location of the rockshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To facilitate easier vertical adjustment of the rockshaft <b>42</b>, an adjustable support structure <b>120</b> extends between the frame bracket <b>90</b> and the bearing block attachment structure. As shown, the support structure <b>120</b> includes a threaded end <b>122</b> extending upwardly through an aperture in a horizontal member <b>124</b> on the bracket <b>90</b>. A nut <b>126</b> threaded onto the end <b>122</b> maintains the support structure <b>120</b> in the bracket aperture and facilitates vertical adjustment of a lower eye end <b>128</b> which receives the end of the upper bearing block bolt <b>102</b>. The bolt <b>102</b> also passes through a backing plate or bracket support <b>130</b> which abuts the slotted wall <b>92</b> adjacent the slot. The change the vertical location of the rockshaft <b>42</b> relative to the frame <b>12</b>, the bolts <b>110</b> are removed and the bearing block bolt <b>102</b> is loosened. The structure <b>120</b> supports the rockshaft <b>42</b> when the bolts <b>110</b> are removed from the apertures. The operator then rotates the nut <b>126</b> to raise or lower the eye end <b>128</b> until the set of apertures <b>98</b> in the plate <b>96</b> align with the apertures in the wall <b>92</b> providing the desired .height setting. The slots in the wall <b>92</b> facilitate vertical movement of the bearing block bolts and thus the bearing block support <b>94</b>. The bolts <b>110</b> are then inserted into the aligned sets of apertures and tightened secure the rockshaft <b>42</b> ins position relative to the frame <b>12</b>. The support structure <b>120</b> therefore supports the rockshaft <b>42</b> during adjustments and helps align the apertures for easy insertion of the bolts <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The frame bracket <b>64</b> for the rockshaft cylinder <b>60</b> is also connected to the plate <b>96</b> by a bracket support <b>130</b> adjacent the bearing block support <b>94</b>. Therefore, the cylinder <b>60</b> automatically maintains proper positional relationship with the rockshaft <b>42</b> as the rockshaft height is adjusted. The cylinders <b>60</b> can be connected by a conventional hydraulic system to an adjustable pressure regulator <b>140</b> to provide adjustable downpressure for the leading fertilizer openers <b>40</b>.</p>
