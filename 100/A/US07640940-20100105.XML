<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a dish washing machine, and more particularly, to a drive unit for dish washing machines that can be easily assembled and is capable of improving wash water filtering performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a dish washing machine is a machine that injects wash water to dishes to wash the dishes, and heats the washed dishes to dry the washed dishes. A conventional dish washing machine is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The construction of the conventional dish washing machine will be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional dish washing machine comprises: upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>; upper and lower racks <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>; and a drive unit <b>10</b>, all of which are mounted in a tub <b>1</b>. To the drive unit <b>10</b> are connected upper and lower connection pipes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> for pumping out wash water and a drain hose <b>9</b> for draining the wash water. The upper and lower connection pipes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are connected to the upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively. The upper rack <b>6</b> is disposed above the upper injection arm <b>4</b>, and the lower rack <b>7</b> is disposed above the lower injection arm <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are rotatably disposed above the drive unit <b>10</b>. Each of the upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> has injection holes for allowing wash water to be injected to the corresponding rack therethrough. In addition, the lower injection arm <b>5</b> has injection holes for allowing wash water to be injected therethrough to remove food particles from a filter of the drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The drive unit <b>10</b> will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The drive unit <b>10</b> comprises: a sump <b>20</b> for receiving wash water; a heater <b>30</b> mounted to the sump <b>20</b> for heating wash water; a washing pump mounted to the sump <b>20</b> for pumping out wash water; a drain pump mounted to the sump <b>20</b> for draining wash water; and filtering device for guiding some of the pumped-out wash water to the upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and filtering the remainder of the pumped-out wash water.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sump <b>20</b> has a wash water receiving space <b>21</b> for substantially receiving wash water defined therein. Also, the sump <b>20</b> has a drain chamber <b>22</b>, which is partitioned from the wash water receiving space <b>21</b>. To the outside of the wash water receiving space <b>21</b> is mounted a flow channel control device <b>25</b>. To the flow channel control device <b>25</b> a flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is connected via a shaft. Also, the sump <b>20</b> has a plurality of bosses <b>29</b>, to which the filtering device is fixed by fixing members.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The washing pump comprises: a washing motor <b>41</b> disposed below the sump <b>20</b> for generating a driving force; and an impeller <b>42</b> mounted in the filtering device for pumping out wash water. The impeller <b>42</b> is connected to a shaft of the washing motor <b>41</b>. The drain pump is mounted to the drain chamber <b>22</b> of the sump <b>20</b>. The drain pump comprises a drain motor <b>51</b> and a drain impeller <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The filtering device comprises: a pump housing <b>60</b> having a space for allowing the impeller <b>42</b> to be mounted therein; a filter housing <b>70</b> mounted for covering the top of the pump housing <b>60</b>; and a cover <b>80</b> mounted for covering the top of the filter housing <b>70</b> and the top of the sump <b>20</b>. The pump housing <b>60</b> is disposed at the lower surface of the filter housing <b>70</b>. The cover <b>80</b> is disposed at the upper surface of the filter housing <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The filter housing <b>70</b> has a solid waste chamber <b>75</b> defined therein. The solid waste chamber <b>75</b> has an outlet port <b>75</b><i>a</i>, which communicates with the drain chamber <b>22</b>. The outlet port <b>75</b><i>a </i>extends a predetermined length downward from the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> such that the outlet port <b>75</b><i>a </i>can be inserted into the drain chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The cover <b>80</b> has a filter <b>81</b>, which corresponds to the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b>. At the cover, around the filter <b>81</b>, are formed a plurality of collection holes <b>82</b>. The collection holes <b>82</b> communicate with the sump <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The assembly of the drive unit <b>10</b> will now be described. At the edge of the pump housing <b>60</b> are formed a plurality of bosses <b>67</b>. At the filter housing <b>70</b> are formed a plurality of fixing holes <b>77</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>67</b> of the pump housing <b>60</b>, respectively. The fixing holes <b>77</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b> are arranged along a circumferential part, which is spaced a predetermined distance from the edge of the filter housing <b>70</b> toward the center of the filter housing <b>70</b>. The bosses <b>67</b> have fixing holes formed therein, respectively. Consequently, the pump housing <b>60</b> is fixed to the filter housing <b>70</b> by inserting fixing members B<b>1</b> into the fixing holes of the bosses <b>67</b> of the pump housing <b>60</b> through the fixing holes <b>77</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At the edge of the filter housing <b>70</b> are also formed a plurality of bosses <b>78</b>, which extend outward from the edge of the filter housing <b>70</b>. At the cover <b>80</b> are formed a plurality of fixing holes <b>88</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>78</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b>, respectively. The bosses <b>78</b> have fixing holes formed therein, respectively. Consequently, the filter housing <b>70</b> is fixed to the cover <b>80</b> by inserting fixing members B<b>2</b> into the fixing holes of the bosses <b>78</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b> through the fixing holes <b>88</b> of the cover <b>80</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">At the cover <b>80</b> are also formed a plurality of fixing holes <b>89</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>29</b> of the sump <b>20</b>, respectively. Consequently, the cover <b>80</b> is fixed to the sump <b>20</b> by inserting fixing members B<b>3</b> into fixing holes formed in the bosses <b>29</b> of the sump <b>20</b> through the fixing holes <b>89</b> of the cover <b>80</b>, respectively. Since the cover <b>80</b> is supported by the sump <b>20</b>, the pump housing <b>60</b> and the filter housing <b>70</b> do not fall. In this way, fixing between the pump housing <b>60</b> and the filter housing <b>70</b>, between the filter housing <b>70</b> and the cover <b>80</b>, and between the cover <b>80</b> and the sump <b>20</b> is accomplished by means of the fixing members B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The filter housing <b>70</b> will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the filter housing <b>70</b> comprises: a wash water inlet port <b>72</b> for allowing wash water pumped out from the impeller <b>42</b> to be introduced therethrough; main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>and a sampling flow channel <b>74</b> connected to the wash water inlet port <b>72</b>; and a solid waste chamber <b>75</b> connected to the sampling flow channel <b>74</b>. At the outlet port <b>75</b><i>a </i>of the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> is mounted an opening/closing valve for allowing wash water and food particles to be discharged from the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> to the drain chamber <b>22</b> when a draining operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">At the wash water inlet port <b>72</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b> is rotatably mounted a flow channel control valve <b>26</b> for opening or closing the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b</i>. The flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is connected to the flow channel control device <b>25</b>, which is mounted to the sump <b>20</b>, via a shaft. At the edge of the channel control valve <b>26</b> is formed an opening/closing rib <b>26</b><i>a </i>for opening or closing the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The operation of the dish washing machine with the above-stated construction will now be described. The dish washing machine successively or selectively performs a preliminary washing operation, a main washing operation, a rinsing operation, a heating and rinsing operation, and a drying operation to wash dishes. Draining operations are performed between the respective operations. Hereinafter, the main washing operation will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the main washing operation is initiated, the washing motor <b>41</b> is rotated, and therefore, the impeller <b>42</b> is rotated. The impeller <b>42</b> pumps out wash water (containing a detergent) from the sump <b>20</b> to the wash water inlet port <b>72</b> of the pump housing <b>60</b>. At this time, the flow channel control device <b>25</b> is rotated, and therefore, the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> either selectively opens the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, or simultaneously opens the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As a result, some of the wash water in the wash water inlet port <b>72</b> is introduced into the upper injection arm <b>4</b> and/or the lower injection arm <b>5</b> through the main flow channel <b>73</b><i>a </i>and/or the main flow channel <b>73</b><i>b</i>, and the remainder of the wash water is introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> simultaneously or alternately opens the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>such that the wash water can be supplied to not only the upper injection arm <b>4</b> but also the lower injection arm <b>5</b>. At this time, some of the wash water is always introduced into the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> irrespective of which main flow channel(s) is opened by the flow channel control valve <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wash water introduced into the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> is directly guided into the solid waste chamber <b>75</b>. The wash water guided into the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> overflows through the filter <b>81</b>, which is disposed above the solid waste chamber <b>75</b>. At this time, the filter <b>81</b> filters the wash water such that foreign matter is separated from the wash water.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The filtered wash water and the wash water dropping from the upper and lower injection arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> is introduced again into the sump <b>20</b> through the collection holes <b>82</b> of the cover <b>80</b>. In this way, the wash water is filtered. It should be noted that some of the wash water is not filtered for a short period of time, but almost all of the wash water is filtered during the main washing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After the washing operation is completed as described above, a draining operation is initiated. When the draining operation is initiated, the drain pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are operated. At this time, the wash water and the food particles are introduced into the drain pump <b>51</b> and impeller <b>52</b> from the sump <b>20</b> by a suction force of the drain pump <b>51</b> and impeller <b>52</b>. At the same time, the wash water and the food particles are introduced into the drain pump <b>51</b> and impeller <b>52</b> from the solid waste chamber <b>75</b> through the outlet port <b>75</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The wash water and the food particles introduced into the drain pump <b>51</b> and impeller <b>52</b> are drained out of the dish washing machine through the drain hose <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the conventional dish washing machine has the following problems. First, the pump housing is not supported by the sump. The pump housing is fixed to the lower part of the filter housing. As a result, the fixing operation of the impeller to the shaft of the washing motor is very complicated, and therefore, time required to assemble the drive unit is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Secondly, the assembly of the pump housing and the filter housing is accomplished by fixing members. After that, the assembly of the cover and the sump is accomplished by fixing members. As a result, the assembly of the drive unit is very complicated, and the number of fixing members is considerably increased.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thirdly, the assembly of the pump housing and the filter housing is accomplished by fixing members, and the assembly of the filter housing and the cover is accomplished by fixing members, which are different from those used to assemble the pump housing and the filter housing. As a result, gaps are created between the pump housing and the filter housing and between the filter housing and the cover if the assembly of the pump housing and the filter housing and/or the assembly of the filter housing and the cover is not secure. Consequently, wash water leaks from the gaps created between the pump housing and the filter housing and between the filter housing and the cover, and therefore, wash water pumping performance is decreased. Furthermore, it is necessary to increase the capacity of the washing pump. Consequently, the size of the dish washing machine is increased, and therefore, the manufacturing costs of the dish washing machine are also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fourthly, the installation space for the solid waste chamber is seriously restricted due to the various flow channels of the filter housing. Consequently, filtering capacity is reduced, and the degree of freedom for installation of the solid waste chamber is decreased. Fifthly, the bottom surface of the solid waste chamber is horizontally disposed. Consequently, solid waste, such as food particles, remains in the solid waste chamber.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present invention is further described in the detailed description which follows, by reference to the noted plurality of drawings by way of non-limiting examples of preferred embodiments of the present invention, in which like reference numerals represent similar parts throughout the several views of the drawings, and wherein:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating a drive unit for dish washing machines according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the drive unit comprises: a sump <b>100</b> for receiving wash water; a pump housing <b>210</b> disposed inside the sump <b>100</b> such that the pump housing <b>210</b> is supported by the sump <b>100</b>, the pump housing <b>210</b> having a washing impeller <b>120</b> located therein; a flow channel housing <b>220</b> disposed to cover the top of the pump housing <b>210</b>, the flow channel housing <b>220</b> having flow channels <b>222</b> for guiding some of the wash water pumped out from the washing impeller <b>120</b> to washing arms and a solid waste chamber <b>221</b> for filtering some of the pumped-out wash water; a filter housing <b>230</b> integrally fixed to the upper part of the flow channel housing <b>220</b> by thermal fusion, the filter housing <b>230</b> having a filter opening <b>232</b>, which corresponds to the solid waste chamber <b>221</b>; and an arm holder <b>240</b> integrally fixed to the upper part of the filter housing <b>230</b> by thermal fusion. The arm holder <b>240</b> has a filter <b>241</b> disposed to cover the filter opening <b>232</b> of the filter housing <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the pump housing <b>210</b> is disposed inside the sump <b>100</b> such that the pump housing <b>210</b> is supported by the sump <b>100</b>, the washing impeller <b>120</b> is securely fitted onto the shaft of a washing motor, and then the thermally-fused integral body (i.e., the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b>) is securely attached to the pump housing <b>210</b>. Consequently, assembly of the drive unit is simplified. Also, leakage of wash water from between the housings is prevented since the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b> are integrally fixed to one another by thermal fusion. Consequently, pumping performance is increased. Furthermore, the number of the bosses and the fixing holes formed at the thermally-fused integral body is considerably decreased as compared to the prior art. Consequently, the structure of the drive unit is simplified, and the degree of freedom for designing the drive unit is increased as compared to the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b> that are integrally fixed to one another by thermal fusion are shown separated from one another. For example, the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b> are separated from one another by cutting. The cut parts are hatched as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b>, which are integrally fixed to one another by thermal fusion, and the pump housing <b>210</b> are securely attached to the sump <b>100</b> by means of fixing members, which are inserted through the arm holder <b>240</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b>, the flow channel housing <b>220</b> and the pump housing <b>210</b>. In other words, only two components, i.e., the pump housing <b>210</b> and the thermally-fused integral body, are securely attached to the sump <b>100</b> by means of the fixing members. Consequently, the assembly of the drive unit is simplified. In addition, a sealing member <b>140</b> is interposed between the pump housing <b>210</b> and the thermally-fused integral body.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The housing coupling structure will now be described in detail. At the sump <b>100</b> are formed a plurality of bosses <b>119</b>. At the pump housing <b>210</b> are formed fixing holes <b>219</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. At the edge of the pump housing <b>210</b> are formed supporting parts <b>215</b>, which extend outward from the edge of the pump housing <b>210</b>. The fixing holes <b>219</b> are also formed at the supporting parts <b>215</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b>. At the thermally-fused integral body are formed bosses <b>229</b> and <b>239</b> and fixing holes <b>249</b>, which correspond to the fixing holes <b>219</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b> and the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. Specifically, the bosses <b>229</b> and <b>239</b> are formed at the flow channel housing <b>220</b> and the filter housing <b>230</b>, respectively. The bosses <b>229</b> of the flow channel housing <b>220</b> correspond to the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. Also, the bosses <b>239</b> of the filter housing <b>230</b> correspond to the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. The fixing holes <b>219</b> and <b>249</b> are formed at the pump housing <b>210</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b>, respectively. The fixing holes <b>219</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b> correspond to the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. Also, the fixing holes <b>249</b> of the arm holder <b>240</b> correspond to the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. Consequently, the sump <b>100</b>, the pump housing <b>210</b> and the thermally-fused integral body are arranged such that the bosses and the fixing holes are aligned as described above, and then the thermally-fused integral body and the pump housing <b>210</b> are securely attached to the sump <b>100</b> by means of fixing members <b>270</b> at one time.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The filter housing <b>230</b> has an upper chamber <b>231</b> whose bottom surface is higher, by a predetermined amount, than the bottom surface of the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> such that the bottom surfaces of the upper chamber <b>231</b> and the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> are arranged in the shape of a step. The upper chamber <b>231</b> communicates with the solid waste chamber <b>221</b>. The filter <b>241</b> of the arm holder <b>240</b> is disposed to cover the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b>. It should be noted, however, that the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> are nominally classified (or arbitrarily designated), and therefore, the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> substantially constitute a single solid waste chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The upper chamber <b>231</b> is disposed such that the upper chamber <b>231</b> deviates (i.e., extends away from) the solid waste chamber <b>221</b>. For example, the upper chamber <b>231</b> and the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> are connected to each other and are configured to have the shape of a ring. Preferably, the upper chamber <b>231</b> is constructed to cover the top of a predetermined region of the flow channel housing <b>220</b> where a flow channel control valve <b>130</b> and main flow channels <b>222</b> are disposed. As a result, the region of the flow channel housing <b>220</b> where the solid waste chamber cannot be formed due to the flow channel control valve and the main flow channels in the conventional art is used as the solid waste chamber, and therefore, the size of the solid waste chamber is considerably increased. However, the shape of the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> is not limited to the above-mentioned ring. For example, the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> may be formed in the shape of a square or rectangular frame, or a triangular frame.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> is formed an inlet/outlet port <b>225</b> for allowing wash water to be introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> through the port <b>225</b> when a washing operation is performed and allowing solid waste, which is separated from the wash water by filtering, to be discharged out of the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> through the port <b>225</b> when a draining operation is performed. Preferably, the bottom surface of the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the bottom surface of the upper chamber <b>231</b> are inclined downward toward the inlet/outlet port <b>225</b>. In this case, the wash water is smoothly discharged from the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> to a drain chamber <b>110</b> when the draining operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Preferably, the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> communicate with each other in the vicinity of the inlet/outlet port <b>225</b>. Also preferably, the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> are partitioned from each other at the side opposite to the inlet/outlet port <b>225</b>. For example, both ends of the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> are connected to both ends of the upper chamber <b>231</b> when the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> are connected to each other such that the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> are arranged in the shape of a ring. At one of the two connections where the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> are connected to each other, which is opposite to the inlet/outlet port <b>225</b>, is formed a partition rib <b>234</b>. Consequently, circulation of wash water along the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> and the upper chamber <b>231</b> is prevented by the partition rib <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The inlet/outlet port <b>225</b> has two flow channels (not shown) formed vertically therethrough. The two flow channels are partitioned from each other such that one of the flow channels communicates with a sampling flow channel <b>223</b> and the drain chamber <b>110</b> while the other flow channel communicates with the drain chamber <b>110</b> and the solid waste chamber <b>221</b>. As a result, the sampling flow channel <b>223</b>, the drain chamber <b>110</b>, and the solid waste chamber <b>221</b> communicate with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At the edge of the filter housing <b>230</b> are formed collection holes <b>233</b>. Each of the collection holes <b>233</b> is open to outside, and communicates with the sump <b>100</b>. At the upper end of the edge of the sump <b>100</b> are preferably formed fixing ribs <b>111</b>, which are inserted into the collection holes <b>233</b> of the filter housing <b>230</b>, respectively. The filter housing <b>230</b> is prevented from being rotated by the provision of the fixing ribs <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The assembly process of the drive unit for dish washing machines according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. When the pump housing <b>210</b> is disposed inside the sump <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fixing holes <b>219</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b> are aligned with the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>, respectively. At this time, the supporting parts <b>215</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b> are supported by the sump <b>100</b>. After the pump housing <b>210</b> is disposed in the sump <b>100</b>, the washing impeller <b>120</b> is securely fitted onto the shaft of the washing motor.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After the washing impeller <b>120</b> is securely fitted on the shaft of the washing motor, the thermally-fused integral body (i.e., the flow channel housing <b>220</b>, the filter housing <b>230</b> and the arm holder <b>240</b>) is placed above the pump housing <b>210</b> such that the bosses <b>229</b> and <b>239</b> and fixing holes <b>249</b> of the thermally-fused integral body and the fixing holes <b>219</b> of the pump housing <b>210</b> are aligned with the corresponding bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b>. Subsequently, the fixing members <b>270</b> are inserted into the bosses <b>119</b> of the sump <b>100</b> through the fixing holes <b>249</b>, the bosses <b>239</b>, the bosses <b>229</b>, and the fixing holes <b>219</b>, respectively, at one time. In this way, the drive unit is easily and conveniently assembled.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the drive unit for dish washing machines comprises: a sump <b>300</b> for receiving wash water; a pump housing <b>410</b> disposed inside the sump <b>300</b> such that the pump housing <b>410</b> is supported by the sump <b>300</b>, the pump housing <b>410</b> having a washing impeller <b>320</b> located therein; a flow channel housing <b>420</b> disposed to cover the top of the pump housing <b>410</b>, the flow channel housing <b>420</b> having flow channels <b>422</b> for guiding some of the wash water pumped out from the washing impeller <b>320</b> to washing arms and a solid waste chamber <b>421</b> for filtering some of the pumped-out wash water; a filter housing <b>430</b> disposed to cover the top of the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b> having a filter opening <b>432</b>, which corresponds to the solid waste chamber <b>421</b>, and collection holes communicating with the sump <b>300</b> for conveying the wash water to the sump <b>300</b>; an arm holder <b>440</b> disposed above the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, the arm holder <b>440</b> having a filter <b>441</b> disposed to cover the filter opening <b>432</b> of the filter housing <b>430</b>; and fixing members <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> for securely attaching the pump housing <b>410</b>, the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b> and the arm holder <b>440</b> to the sump <b>300</b>. The fixing members <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> are inserted into the sump <b>300</b> through the arm holder <b>440</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b>, the flow channel housing <b>420</b> and the pump housing <b>410</b> in order.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">While the pump housing <b>410</b> is disposed inside the sump <b>300</b> such that the pump housing <b>410</b> is supported by the sump <b>300</b>, the washing impeller <b>320</b> is fitted onto the shaft of a washing motor. As a result, the assembly process of the drive unit is simplified. Also, the housings of the drive unit are securely coupled with one another at one time, since the fixing members <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> are inserted into the sump <b>300</b> through the arm holder <b>440</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b>, the flow channel housing <b>420</b> and the pump housing <b>410</b> in order. Consequently, the assembly process of the drive unit is simplified, and the coupling force between the housings is considerably increased. Between the pump housing <b>410</b> and the flow channel housing <b>420</b> is disposed a sealing member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The housing coupling structure will now be described in detail. At the sump <b>300</b> are formed a plurality of bosses <b>319</b>. At the pump housing <b>410</b> and the arm holder <b>440</b> are formed fixing holes <b>419</b> and <b>449</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>319</b> of the sump <b>300</b>, respectively. At the flow channel housing <b>420</b> and the filter housing <b>430</b> are formed bosses <b>429</b> and <b>439</b>, which also correspond to the bosses <b>319</b> of the sump <b>300</b>, respectively. The fixing members <b>470</b> are inserted into the bosses <b>319</b> of the sump <b>300</b> through the fixing holes <b>449</b> of the arm holder <b>440</b>, the bosses <b>439</b> of the filter housing <b>430</b>, the bosses <b>429</b> of the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, and the fixing holes <b>419</b> of the pump housing <b>410</b> in order.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At the edge of the pump housing <b>410</b> are formed a plurality of bosses <b>417</b>. At the flow channel housing <b>420</b> are formed bosses <b>427</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>417</b> of the pump housing <b>410</b>, respectively. At the filter housing <b>430</b> are formed bosses <b>437</b>, which correspond to the bosses <b>417</b> of the pump housing <b>410</b>, respectively. At the arm holder <b>440</b> are formed fixing holes <b>447</b>, which also correspond to the bosses <b>417</b> of the pump housing <b>410</b>, respectively. The fixing members <b>480</b> are inserted into the bosses <b>417</b> of the pump housing <b>410</b> through the fixing holes <b>447</b> of the arm holder <b>440</b>, the bosses <b>437</b> of the filter housing <b>430</b>, and the bosses <b>427</b> of the flow channel housing <b>420</b> in order. In this way, the housings are arranged such that the housings are vertically stacked, and then the housings are securely coupled with one another by means of the fixing members <b>470</b> and <b>480</b>. Consequently, the drive unit is assembled at one time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At the filter housing <b>430</b> is also formed an upper chamber <b>431</b>, in addition to the solid waste chamber <b>421</b>. The solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> are substantially identical to those of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Therefore, a detailed description of the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> will not be given.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Preferably, communication holes <b>428</b> and <b>438</b> are formed at the regions of the flow channel housing <b>420</b> and the filter housing <b>430</b> surrounded by the filter opening <b>432</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b>. The communication holes <b>428</b> and <b>438</b> communicate with the sump <b>300</b> for discharging leaked wash water to the sump <b>300</b>. Also preferably, the communication holes <b>428</b> and <b>438</b> are disposed such that the communication holes <b>428</b> and <b>438</b> deviate from an impeller location part <b>311</b> where the washing impeller <b>320</b> is located. In addition, collection holes <b>433</b> are formed at the edge of the filter hosing <b>430</b>. Each of the collection holes <b>433</b> opens to the outside, and communicates with the sump <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The assembly process of the drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment is very similar to that of the first preferred embodiment, and therefore, a detailed description will not be given of the assembly process of the drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment. However, the drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment is characterized in that that the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b>, and the arm holder <b>440</b> are individually prepared, and are then securely coupled with one another by means of the fixing members <b>470</b> and <b>480</b>. The drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment is further characterized in that the housings are coupled with one another by means of the fixing members at one time, whereby the coupling force between the housings is increased, and leakage of the wash water is effectively prevented. Also, the drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment is characterized in that the communication holes <b>428</b> and <b>438</b> are provided to discharge wash water leaking from the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b>, although no communication holes are necessary for the drive unit according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, which includes the thermally-fused integral body as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The operation of the drive unit for dish washing machines with the above-stated construction according to the present invention will now be described in detail. The operation of the drive unit according to the first preferred embodiment is identical to that of the second preferred embodiment. Hereinafter, the operation of the drive unit according to the second preferred embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A main washing operation will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>. When the main washing operation is initiated, the impeller <b>320</b> introduces wash water from the sump <b>300</b> to the impeller location part <b>411</b>. The wash water is pumped out, and is then introduced to the wash water inlet port of the flow channel housing <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As the flow channel control valve <b>330</b> is rotated, the main flow channels <b>422</b> are selectively, simultaneously, or alternately opened or closed. At this time, some of the pumped-out wash water is introduced into the upper injection arm and/or the lower injection arm through the main flow channels <b>422</b>. Also, some of the pumped-out wash water is introduced into the sampling flow channel <b>423</b>. At this time, the wash water is introduced into the sampling flow channel <b>423</b> irrespective of which main flow channel(s) <b>422</b> is opened by the flow channel control valve <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The wash water introduced into the sampling flow channel <b>423</b> flows into the drain chamber <b>310</b> through the inlet/outlet port <b>425</b>. A pollution level detector <b>424</b> is mounted in the sampling flow channel <b>423</b>. The pollution level detector <b>424</b> (which can be of a suitable construction or type) serves to detect the pollution level of the wash water and transmit the detected pollution level of the wash water to a control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Relatively large-sized food particles, which are contained in the wash water in the drain chamber <b>310</b>, are deposited on the bottom surface of the drain chamber <b>310</b>. Consequently, the food particles are primarily separated from the wash water in the drain chamber <b>310</b>. The drain chamber <b>310</b> serves as a submerged tank when the washing operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the wash water introduced into the drain chamber <b>310</b> flows into the solid wasted chamber <b>421</b> through the inlet/outlet port <b>425</b>. At this time, food particles are accumulated in the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> from the partition rib side to the wash water inlet side. Also, relatively small-sized food particles are introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b>, and therefore, the amount of food particles introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As the amount of wash water introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> is gradually increased, the wash water is introduced into the upper chamber <b>431</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At this time, the partition rib <b>434</b> prevents the wash water from flowing from the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> to the upper chamber <b>431</b>. Also, food particles are accumulated in the upper chamber <b>431</b> from the partition rib side to the wash water inlet side. As a result, the filter <b>441</b> is effectively prevented from being blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, the wash water is introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> via the drain chamber <b>310</b>. Consequently, the water pressure applied to the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> is relatively decreased as compared to the prior art. Also, the wash water primarily filtered in the drain chamber <b>310</b> is introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b>. As a result, the amount of food particles introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> is decreased compared to the prior art. Also, the upper chamber <b>431</b> is formed such that the upper chamber <b>431</b> can cover the top of the main flow channels <b>422</b> and the flow channel control valve <b>330</b>, and therefore, the filtering capacity is increased. Furthermore, the food particles are accumulated in the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> from the partition rib side to the wash water inlet side, and therefore, the filter <b>441</b> is effectively prevented from being blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The wash water introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> as described above overflows through the filter <b>441</b>. At this time, relatively small-sized food particles contained in the wash water are secondarily separated from the wash water by the filter <b>441</b>. The filtered wash water is introduced again into the sump <b>300</b> through the collection holes <b>433</b> of the filter housing <b>430</b>. Here, the pumping force of the impeller <b>320</b> creates water pressure, by which the wash water is introduced into the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> via the drain chamber <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A small amount of wash water leaks through gaps between the flow channel housing <b>420</b>, the filter housing <b>430</b> and the arm holder <b>440</b>, and is then introduced into the regions of the flow channel housing <b>420</b> and the filter housing <b>430</b> surrounded by the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b>. The leaked wash water is collected into the sump <b>300</b> through the communication holes <b>428</b>, <b>438</b>. Consequently, the drive unit is sanitarily used.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After the washing operation is completed, a draining operation is initiated. When the draining operation is initiated, the drain pump is operated. At this time, the wash water and the food particles are introduced into the drain chamber <b>310</b> from the sump <b>300</b>. At the same time, the wash water and the food particles are introduced into the drain chamber <b>310</b> from the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> through the inlet/outlet port <b>425</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The bottom surfaces of the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> are inclined downward toward the inlet/outlet port <b>425</b>. Consequently, discharge of the food particles from the solid waste chamber <b>421</b> and the upper chamber <b>431</b> is facilitated. Also, circulation of the food particles is prevented by the partition rib <b>434</b>. Consequently, the food particles are completely discharged when the wash water is drained. The wash water and the food particles introduced into the drain chamber <b>310</b> are drained out of the dish washing machine through the drain port.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As apparent from the above description, the drive unit for dish washing machines according to the present invention has the following effects. First, the pump housing is disposed inside the sump such that the pump housing is supported by the sump, and then the washing impeller is fitted onto the shaft of the washing motor, according to the first and second preferred embodiments of the present invention. Consequently, easy and convenient coupling between the shaft of the washing motor and the washing impeller is accomplished, and therefore, time required to assemble the drive unit is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Secondly, the fixing members are inserted through the arm holder, the filter housing, and the pump housing, according to the first and second preferred embodiments of the present invention. Consequently, the assembly process of the drive unit is simplified. Furthermore, the number of the fixing members is considerably decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thirdly, the flow channel housing, the filter housing and the arm holder are integrally fixed to one another by thermal fusion to constitute the thermally-fused integral body, according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Consequently, leakage of wash water from between the housings is effectively prevented. As a result, decrease of wash water pumping performance due to the leakage of wash water is prevented, and therefore, it is not necessary to increase the capacity of the washing pump. Furthermore, the size and the manufacturing costs of the dish washing machine are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Fourthly, the upper chamber is disposed to cover the tops of the various flow channels of the flow channel housing. As a result, the size of the soiled water chamber is increased. Consequently, filtering capacity is considerably increased, and the degree of freedom for installation of the solid waste chamber is increased. Fifthly, the bottom surfaces of the solid waste chamber and the upper chamber are inclined downward toward the wash water draining side. As a result, discharge of food particles is facilitated when the draining operation is performed.</p>
