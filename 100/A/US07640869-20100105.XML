<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2004/00886, filed Aug. 2, 2004, which claims priority of Chinese Application Nos. 200320106047.3, filed Oct. 7, 2003 and 200320107316.8, filed Nov. 21, 2003. The disclosure of all prior applications are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a folding desk, more particularly, to a height-adjustable folding desk.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Folding desks are used in the home or office. In the office, small items can be put on the desk, or the desk can be used as a tea table or during meetings, papers, drawings, pens and so on can be put on the desk; at home, a desk can be used in studying, working, or ironing. Accordingly, the structure of a folding desk should be designed for easy folding and moving.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, existing folding desks with leg-folding features, fall into two main categories: 1. The first one is where the two leg supports are vertically fixed to the two sides of the lower surface of the desk, and the leg supports can fold toward the middle of the desk; 2. The second one is composed of desk legs which are cross-connected with each other, forming a folding structure. For folding, because the former is not as easy as the latter, most folding desks adopt the latter format.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In both cases, the desk leg often uses a shrinking sleeve. This shrinking structure has the following drawbacks: 1. the shrinking structure leads the desk leg to have an overlapped portion, so material use is increased, increasing the cost of manufacture; 2. in order to adjust the height, one must use a fixing structure to keep the desk at the needed height. Because the stress to the fixing structure is great, the fixing structure is prone to breaking; 3. The four desk legs must be adjusted respectively, so the operation is inconvenient; 4. In the case of a folding desk which adopts crossed desk legs, the desk legs are kept at an angle of inclination, while the desk legs include a shrinking sleeve. This leads to great complexity and increased stress to the fixing structure, and greatly reduced stability. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved desk or table whose height can be conveniently adjusted.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention is to provide a height-adjustable folding desk. The aim is to resolve the above drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a height-adjustable folding table or desk, which comprises a tabletop, a first support and a second support, wherein each of the first support and the second support comprises a left foot portion and a right foot portion linked via a connecting portion, wherein the left foot portions of the first and second foot supports are rotationally cross-connected with each other, and the right foot portions of the first and second foot supports are rotationally cross-connected with each other, wherein the connecting portion of the first foot support is pivotally connected with one end of the lower surface of the tabletop, wherein the other end of the lower surface of the tabletop comprises a fixture comprising an adjustment board which comprises a plurality of grooves configured to receive the connecting portion of the second foot support, and wherein the connecting portion of the second foot support is fitted into a groove of the adjustable fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the fixture further comprises a pressure lever, and a torsion spring, wherein one end of the pressure lever is rotationally connected with the lower surface of the tabletop, the end of the pressure lever is the free end, and the torsion spring keeps the pressure lever in firm contact with the lower surface of the tabletop, or with the connecting portion of the second foot support if it is received in one of the plurality of grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the fixture comprises two adjustment boards flanking the pressure lever, wherein the grooves of the two adjustment boards are positioned to correspond to each other for receiving the connecting portion of the second foot support.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the pressure lever is longer than the adjustment board, and the free end bends away from the under surface of the tabletop.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the pressure lever is T-shaped, having a traverse rod and a longitudinal rod, wherein the two ends of the transverse rod are pivotally connected with the lower surface of tabletop, wherein the torsion spring comprises a body, and two extending portion, wherein the transverse rod is inserted into the torsion spring body, one of the extending portion of the torsion spring is in contact with the lower surface of the tabletop, the other extending portion is hooked to the longitudinal rod of the T-shaped pressure lever.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the plurality of grooves are configured such that they have an approximately vertical inner wall on the side away from the free end of the pressure lever, and a sloped inner wall on the side near the free end of the pressure lever.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the adjustment board is formed on the desktop integrally.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention comprises a tabletop, a first support and a second support, wherein each of the first support and the second support comprises a left foot portion and a right foot portion linked via a connecting portion, wherein the left foot portions of the first and second foot supports are rotationally cross-connected with each other, and the right foot portions of the first and second foot supports are rotationally cross-connected with each other, wherein the connecting portion of the first foot support is pivotally connected with one end of the lower surface of the tabletop, wherein the other end of the lower surface of the tabletop comprises fixture which comprises a pressure lever and a torsion spring, wherein one end of the pressure lever is rotationally connected with the lower surface of the tabletop, the end of the pressure lever is the free end, and the torsion spring keeps the pressure lever in firm contact with the lower surface of the tabletop, and wherein the pressure level further comprises a plurality of grooves facing the lower surface of the tabletop and configured to receive the connecting portion of the second foot support, and wherein the connecting portion of the second foot support is fitted into a groove of the pressure lever.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the pressure lever is T-shaped, having a traverse rod and a longitudinal rod, wherein the two ends of the transverse rod are pivotally connected with the lower surface of tabletop.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, the plurality of grooves are configured such that they have an approximately vertical inner wall on the side away from the free end of the pressure lever, and a sloped inner wall on the side near the free end of the pressure lever.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiment of the height-adjustable folding table of the present invention, a handle is set on one end of the transverse rod of the T-shaped adjustable rod, the handle being approximately perpendicular to the lower surface of the desk.</p>
