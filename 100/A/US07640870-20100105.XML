<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A foldable table includes a table top having collapsible legs connected thereto. The table top includes a first table top section and a second table top section. A first hinge assembly hingedly connecting the first table top section to the second table top section such that the table top can selectively move between a folded position and an unfolded position. A latch engages with the first hinge assembly so as to releasably lock the first hinge assembly when the table top is in the unfolded position. In alternative embodiments, portions of the table top sections can interlock when the table is in the unfolded position. A handle can project from between the table top sections when the table is in the folded position.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to tables and, in particular, to foldable tables.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many different types of tables are well known and used for a variety of different purposes. For example, conventional tables may include legs that are pivotally attached to the table top and the legs may be movable between a use position in which the legs extend outwardly from the table top and a storage position in which the legs are folded against the table top. Large, portable tables with folding legs are often referred to as &#x201c;banquet tables&#x201d; and these tables are often used in assembly halls, banquet halls, convention centers, hotels, schools, churches, and other locations where large groups of people meet. Because the tables are portable, the tables can be positioned in an assortment of different configurations and used in a variety of settings. When the tables are no longer needed, the tables can be moved or stored.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ability to collapse the legs on a banquet table allows the table to be more conveniently stored. Even when the legs are collapsed, however, the table top for the table retains its size and shape. For example, many banquet tables have a length in a range between about six to eight feet and a width of about four feet. As a result, the storage of banquet tables even with the legs collapsed still requires a relative large storage area. This required large storage area may not be a problematic for large facilities such as hotels, schools, and churches. It is often desirable, however, to have one or more banquet tables at smaller facilities such as restaurants, offices, or homes where the tables may be used less frequently for special occasions. Conventional banquet tables, even when the legs are folded, are too large and obstructive to be conveniently stored at such smaller facilities. As a result, it is often necessary to rent or borrow the banquet tables for other locations when needed. This process can be inconvenient, time consuming, and costly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, transporting conventional banquet tables can be problematic. That is, because of the length of the banquet tables, they are difficult to move by a single person. As such, two or more people are often required. In addition, the extended length of the banquet tables precludes them from being transported in the trunk or back seat of a car. Rather, they are typically limited to being transported in the bed of a truck or trailer. Again, this can be problematic for those not having access to a truck or trailer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tables have been designed wherein the tabletop is foldable between a folded an unfolded position. Many tables having a foldable tabletop, however, are highly unstable. For example, the table can be weak along the hinge joint causing the table top to sag. To prevent this, foldable table tops are typically made out of stronger and thicker material. As a result, however, the weight of the table increases making them more difficult to carry and move. Tables with foldable tabletops are also more difficult to move and store in that the tabletops often unintentionally swing between the folded and unfolded position as an individual is trying to move, place and/or stack the tables. This is true for attempts to move both a folded and unfolded table. Likewise, tables which have been moved into the folded position can often be difficult to carry in that there no convenient handholds. To exacerbate this problem, attempting to pick the table up in the wrong way can cause the table to unintentionally unfold.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An additional shortcoming of some tables with foldable tabletops is that the hinges are connected to the table top sections using a plurality of screws that are bored into the table top. Disadvantageously, the structural integrity of the table top may be decreased by the holes created by the plurality of screws, and this may allow the table to collapse and fail. In addition, because the screws are typically individually attached to the table top, that may significantly increase the amount of the time required to construct the table.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need therefore exists for a table that eliminates the above-described disadvantages and problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the invention is a table including a table top and legs wherein the legs can be selectively collapsed and the table top can be selectively moved between a folded and unfolded position. Advantageously, when the table is in the unfolded position, the table top and legs create a strong, sturdy and secure table that can be used to support a wide variety of objects and the table can be used for many different purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, because the table top can be selectively moved between the folded and unfolded position, the table can be easily moved by a single person, stored in a much smaller area than conventional tables, and transported in the backseat or trunk of an automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment the table top is constructed from blow-molded plastic to allow a lightweight table to be constructed. Significantly, if the table top is constructed from blow-molded plastic, it can easily be formed into any desired configuration, shape, size and design depending, for example, upon the intended use and/or configuration of the table. The blow-molded table top is also generally weather resistant and temperature insensitive, which allows the table to be used in a wide variety of locations and environments. In addition, the blow-molded table top is durable, long-lasting, and it generally does not corrode, rust or otherwise deteriorate over time. Further, because the blow-molded table top is relatively strong, it can be used to support a relatively large amount of weight. Significantly, the blow-molded table top may form a structural member of the table, or the table top maybe supported by a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, the blow-molded plastic table top is relatively strong because it includes two or more opposing walls or surfaces that are separated by a given distance. The opposing walls help create a high-strength, rigid table top. In addition, because the interior portion of the table top is generally hollow, that creates a lightweight table top. Thus, the blow-molded table top is both lightweight and strong.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of one embodiment of the table, the foldable table top comprises a first table top section and a second table top section that each have an inside edge that bound a central fold joint. Each inside edge has a tongue or groove that aligns with a tongue or groove on the other inside edge. The table top sections are configured so that the tongues and grooves interlock when the table top is in the unfolded position. As a result, the table top has increased strength along the fold joint when the table top is in the unfolded position. Due to the increased strength resulting form the interlocking features, the table top can be made of a lighter material without sacrificing strength or integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the present invention, a handle can be mounted on the bottom surface of the table top such that the handle projects between the inside edges of the table top sections when the table top is in the folded position. In this configuration, a single individual can easily gasp the projecting handle to carry the table. Because of the position of the handle, there is no problem with the table unintentionally unfolding while the table is being carried. Furthermore, the handle is out of the way and thus not obstructive when the table is in the unfolded position. In other embodiments, the handle can be placed at other locations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect is that the table may be easily assembled and/or disassembled because it does not include any heavy or complex mechanisms to attach the legs to the table top or to connect the table top sections. In contrast, the table preferably includes a frame that can be attached to the table top by a snap, friction or interference fit. Specifically, the frame preferably includes two elongated side rails that are connected to frame mounting portions that are integrally formed in the table top. Significantly, no bolts, screws or other mechanical fasteners are required to attach the frame to the table top, but fasteners may be used if desired. Because mechanical fasteners are not required to attach the frame to the table top, fewer parts are required to assemble the table and no decrease in the structural integrity or strength of the table is created.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still another aspect is that the table can be manufactured quickly and easily. In particular, because the frame can be connected to the table top by a snap, friction or interference fit, no fasteners are required to attach the frame to the table top. This may allow the table to be assembled with less time than conventional tables. In addition, because the frame may be simply and easily connected to the table top, fewer workers may be required to assemble the table. Further, the straight forward design and attachment of the frame to the table top may allow the table to be shipped either assembled or unassembled, and it may allow retailers or consumers to assemble the table if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further to the above, in yet another embodiment hinge assemblies are directly mounted to the side rails of the frame so as to hingedly connect the table top sections. The hinge assemblies enable the table top to move between the folded and unfolded positions. Because the hinge assemblies are mounted directly to the side rails, the hinge assemblies do not have to be separately mounted directly to the table top by screws or other fasteners. The hinge assemblies are thus designed to help achieve the benefits as discussed above with regard to the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In still another embodiment, a latch can be movably mounted to one of the hinge assemblies. The latch is designed to selectively lock the hinge assembly when the table top is in the unfolded position. As a result the table top is stable and can be easily moved when in the unfolded position without risk of unintentionally folding. In one embodiment, the latch is spring biased so that the latch automatically locks when the table top is moved into the unfolded position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further aspect of the table is that the legs may be attached to the frame. In particular, the side rails of the frame may include openings that are sized and configured to receive a cross member that allows the legs to pivot between a use position and a storage position relative to the table top. The openings preferably have a non-circular configuration and the cross member also has a non-circular cross-sectional configuration. In particular, the openings and the cross member may have oval, elliptical, oblong or egg-shaped configurations. The openings and cross member are preferably configured such that when the legs are positioned in the folded or stored position, the cross member is relatively loosely held within the openings in the frame. On the other hand, when the legs are in the extended or use position, the cross member is held tightly within the openings in the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a retainer is mounted on a first one of the cross members. The retainer engages with the second cross member on the opposing end of the table top when the table top is moved into the folded position. The retainer helps to retain the table in the folded position so that the table does not unintentionally unfold when the folded table is being carried, transported and/or stored. The retainer is configured to automatically engage with the opposing cross member so as to simplify the engagement process. Furthermore, the retainer is slidably mounted on the first cross member so as to simply the manufacturing process and eliminate the need for separate mechanical fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention is generally directed towards foldable tables having one or more hinges. In one embodiment at least one of the hinges can be selectively locked when the table is in an unfolded position. The principles of the present invention, however, are not limited to tables. It will be understood that, in light of the present disclosure, the hinges and locking features disclosed herein can be successfully used in connection with other types of furniture and structures.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, to assist in the description of the table, words such as top, bottom, front, rear, right and left are used to describe the accompanying figures. It will be appreciated, however, that the table can be located in a variety of desired positions&#x2014;including various angles, sideways and even upside down. A detailed description of the table with hinge now follows.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is one embodiment of an inventive table <b>10</b> incorporating features of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the table <b>10</b> includes a table top <b>12</b> with an upper surface <b>14</b>, a lower surface <b>16</b>, a first end <b>18</b>, a second end <b>20</b>, a front side <b>22</b> and a rear side <b>24</b>. The upper surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> is preferably generally planar to create a smooth, flat working surface, but the upper surface could also be textured and have other suitable configurations depending, for example, upon the intended use of the table <b>10</b>. The table top <b>12</b> may also include an edge <b>26</b> that is disposed about the outer perimeter or periphery of the table top. All or a portion of the edge <b>26</b> may be beveled, sloped or rounded to, for example, increase the comfort and safety of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The table top <b>12</b> may also include a downwardly extending lip <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) disposed near or at the outer portion of the table top. The lip <b>28</b> preferably extends downwardly beyond the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and the lip may be aligned with or form a part of the edge <b>26</b> of the table top. It will be appreciated that the lip <b>28</b> may also be spaced inwardly from the edge <b>26</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Various embodiments of a lip that may be used in conjunction with the table top <b>12</b> are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/096,814, entitled Portable Folding Utility Table with Integral Table Top and Lip, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The table top <b>12</b> preferably has a generally rectangular configuration with rounded corners and slightly rounded edges <b>26</b>. Desirably, the table top <b>12</b> has a relatively large size and it is configured for use as a banquet style table. In particular, the table top <b>12</b> may have a length of about five feet (or about sixty inches) and a width of about two and one-half feet (or about thirty inches), but the table top can be larger or smaller. For example, the table top <b>12</b> could be six or eight feet in length, and the table top could be two or three feet in width. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the table top <b>12</b> can be larger or smaller according, for example, to the intended use of the table <b>10</b>. Additionally, the table top <b>12</b> may have other suitable shapes and configurations such as square, circular, oval, and the like depending, for example, upon the intended use of the table <b>10</b>. In addition, the corners and edges <b>26</b> of the table top <b>12</b> do not have to rounded and, in contrast, the corners and edges could have any desirable configuration, but the rounded features may increase the comfort and/or safety of the user. Further, the table top <b>12</b> could be sized and configured for use with other types of tables such as utility tables, card tables, personal-sized tables, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The table top <b>12</b> is preferably constructed from a lightweight material and, more preferably, the table top is constructed from plastic, such as high density polyethylene. The plastic table top <b>12</b> is desirably formed by a blow-molding process because, for example, it allows a strong, lightweight, rigid and sturdy table top to be quickly and easily manufactured. Other conventional molding processes, such as rotational molding and injection molding, can also be used. Advantageously, the blow-molded plastic table top <b>12</b> is lighter weight that conventional table tops constructed from wood or metal. The blow-molded plastic table top <b>12</b> is lightweight because it is substantially hollow. It will be appreciated that the substantially hollow table top <b>12</b> can include table tops that are generally hollow or completely hollow.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, table top <b>12</b> is preferably constructed from blow-molded plastic because blow-molded plastic table tops are relatively durable, weather resistant, temperature insensitive, corrosion resistant, rust resistant, and blow-molded plastic generally does not deteriorate over time. One skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the table top <b>12</b> does not have to be constructed from blow-molded plastic and other suitable materials and/or processes can be used to construct the table top such as other types of plastics, polymers and synthetic materials. In addition, the table top <b>12</b> may be constructed from other materials with sufficient strength and desirable characteristics such as plywood, particle board, solid wood, wood slates, metal alloys, fiberglass, ceramics, graphite, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The upper surface <b>14</b> and the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> are spaced apart a given distance and these two spaced apart surfaces help create a rigid and strong table top <b>12</b>. Preferably, the upper surface <b>14</b> and the lower surface <b>16</b> are separated by a generally constant distance so that the surfaces are generally aligned in parallel planes. In one embodiment table top <b>12</b> is solid so that upper surface <b>14</b> and lower surface <b>16</b> are directly connected over the entire area of table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such as when table top <b>12</b> is blow-molded, table top <b>12</b> can be substantially hollow so that upper surface <b>14</b> and lower surface <b>16</b> are separated by a gap. For example, table top <b>12</b> can comprises an upper wall <b>250</b> which includes upper surface <b>14</b> and a spaced apart lower wall <b>252</b> which includes lower surface <b>16</b>. Upper wall <b>250</b> and lower wall <b>252</b> are connected together around their perimeter edges by edge <b>26</b>. Furthermore, the upper and lower walls <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may also be interconnected by one or more tack-offs, kiss-offs or depressions <b>30</b>, or other reinforcement structures, which may be sized and configured to further increase the strength and rigidity of the table top <b>12</b>. The depressions <b>30</b> and/or other reinforcement structures can be integrally formed as part of table top <b>12</b>, such as during the blow-molding or other molding processes, or can be formed or attached separately.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The depressions <b>30</b> are preferably located in the lower wall <b>252</b> of table top <b>12</b> and the depressions are preferably sized and configured to increase the strength and structural integrity of the table top <b>12</b>. The depressions <b>30</b> preferably extend towards the upper wall <b>250</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and the ends of the depressions <b>30</b> may contact or engage a bottom surface upper wall <b>250</b> or the ends of the depressions may be spaced from the upper surface of the table top <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the depressions <b>30</b> preferably cover substantially the entire lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>, but it will be appreciated that the depressions may cover only a portion of the table top. Additionally, while the depressions <b>30</b> are shown and described as being located in the lower wall <b>252</b> of the table top <b>12</b>, it will be appreciated that the depressions could be formed in any desired portion of the table top <b>12</b>. For example, it will be appreciated that one or more depressions <b>30</b> may be formed in the upper wall <b>250</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and one or more depressions may be formed in the lower wall <b>252</b> of the table top <b>12</b>, and these opposing depressions may be generally aligned. At least a portion of these opposing depressions <b>30</b> may contact or engage each other, but the opposing depressions do not have to touch or engage.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As discussed above, the depressions <b>30</b> can be arranged into a predetermined pattern or array in order to increase the strength and structural integrity of the table top <b>12</b>. In particular, the depressions <b>30</b> are preferably spaced closely together in a predetermined pattern such that the distance between the depressions is minimized. Advantageously, minimizing the distance between the depressions <b>30</b> may minimize the unsupported areas of the upper wall <b>250</b> of the table top <b>12</b>, which may increase the smoothness of the upper surface <b>14</b> of the table top. In addition, minimizing the distance between the depressions <b>30</b> may increase the structural integrity and strength of the table top <b>12</b>. Thus, the depressions <b>30</b> are desirably closely spaced on the lower wall <b>252</b> of the table top <b>12</b> such that the depressions are separated by a minimum distance in order to create a table top with greater strength, structural integrity, and an upper surface <b>14</b> with increased smoothness.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Advantageously, the increased structural integrity and strength of the table top <b>12</b> may allow the thickness of upper wall <b>250</b> and lower wall <b>252</b> of the table top <b>12</b> to be decreased, which may allow less plastic to be used to construct the table <b>10</b>. Because less plastic may be required to construct the table top <b>12</b>, that may allow the cost of the table <b>10</b> to be decreased. In addition, the blow-molded table top <b>12</b> may cool more quickly during the manufacturing process because of the thinner upper and lower wall. This allows the table top <b>12</b> to be removed from the manufacturing mold more quickly and it may allow the table top to be removed at a higher temperature because it dissipates heat much more rapidly. Significantly, because the cycle time required to construct the table top <b>12</b> may be decreased, the manufacturing efficiency may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The depressions <b>30</b> are also preferably arranged in a predetermined pattern with a generally constant and uniform spacing so that the table top <b>12</b> has generally uniform characteristics. In particular, the depressions <b>30</b> are preferably arranged into a uniform pattern across the entire surface of the table top <b>12</b> so that the strength, structural integrity and/or other characteristics of the table top are generally uniform throughout the table top. Thus, the table top <b>12</b> has fewer, if any, weak or unsupported portions which decrease the strength and structural integrity of the table top. Thus, the depressions <b>30</b> may be used to create a table top <b>12</b> with generally uniform characteristics throughout the table top.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Desirably, other features formed in the table top <b>12</b> are sized and configured such that they do not significantly disturb or disrupt the desired pattern of depressions <b>30</b>. Additional details regarding the size, shape and configuration of depressions that are suitable for use in connection with the table top <b>12</b> are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/409,000, filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled High-Strength, Lightweight Blow-molded Plastic Structures, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In alternative embodiments, it is again appreciated that depressions <b>30</b> and or other reinforcing structures can be eliminated. As such, lower surface <b>16</b> can be substantially flat.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, the lip <b>28</b> is preferably disposed near or at the outer portion of the table top <b>12</b>. As discussed above, the lip <b>28</b> preferably extends downwardly beyond the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and the lip may be aligned with or form part of the edge <b>26</b> of the table top, but the lip may also be spaced inwardly from the edge of the table top <b>12</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the lip <b>28</b> includes an inner surface <b>210</b> and a lower surface <b>212</b>, and the lip preferably has a generally hollow interior. Advantageously, the lip <b>28</b> may be integrally formed during the blow-molding process as part of table top <b>12</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that the lip <b>28</b> does not have to be formed as a unitary component of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The lower surface <b>212</b> of the lip <b>28</b> desirably has a smooth, planar surface that facilitates stacking of the tables <b>10</b>. The inner surface <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b>, however, includes a number of serrations, notches, ribs, and/or struts that are sized and configured to increase the strength, rigidity and/or flexibility of the lip <b>28</b>. In particular, the inner surface <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may include a number of notches, indentations, grooves or other inwardly extending portions <b>216</b> to form an uneven or saw-tooth type surface. The inner surface <b>210</b> may also include a number of bumps, humps, protrusions or other outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> to form an uneven or saw-tooth type surface. The inner surface <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may also contain a combination of inwardly and outwardly portions <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to form the uneven or saw-tooth type surface.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Advantageously, the uneven inner surfaces <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may increase the strength, rigidity and/or flexibility of the lip <b>28</b>, which may increase the strength, rigidity and/or flexibility of the outer portions of the table top <b>12</b>. For example, the uneven inner surfaces <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may allow the outer portions of the table top <b>12</b> to absorb more energy or larger impacts than conventional planar surfaces. Additionally, the uneven inner surfaces <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may absorb more energy without deforming and the uneven inner surfaces <b>210</b> may flex or deflect more without breaking or permanently deforming. Further, the uneven inner surfaces <b>210</b> may be more likely to resiliently return to there original configurations. Thus, the serrated inner surfaces <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b> may form a more durable and longer-lasting outer portion of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The lip <b>28</b> may also include one or more ribs <b>220</b> that increase the wall thickness of the inner surface <b>210</b> of the lip. Advantageously, the ribs <b>220</b> may also increase the strength, rigidity and/or flexibility of the outer portions of the table top <b>12</b>. The ribs <b>220</b> preferably extend from the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> to the lower surface <b>212</b> of the lip <b>28</b> and the ribs are preferably generally vertically aligned, but the ribs may have any suitable arrangement and configuration. It will be appreciated that the ribs <b>220</b> may be used in combination with the inwardly extending portions <b>216</b> and/or the outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> to increase the strength of the table top <b>12</b>. Further, it will be appreciated that the inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may be located in other suitable portions of the table top <b>12</b>, such as the outer surfaces of the lip, the edge <b>22</b> of the table top <b>12</b>, and/or the lower surface <b>212</b> of the lip. It will be understood, however, that the table top <b>12</b> does not require inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> or ribs <b>220</b> be formed in the inner surface of the lip <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Significantly, the inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may be positioned such that they are generally consistent with the pattern of depressions <b>30</b> formed in the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. That is, the inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may be located so that they are aligned with the pattern of depressions <b>30</b> to create a table top <b>12</b> with more uniform characteristics. This may allow a table top <b>12</b> to be constructed with generally consistent strength and structural integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, one or more of the corners <b>222</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may have one or more inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> to increase the strength and structural integrity of the corner. The inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may be spaced closer together in the corners <b>222</b> than along the inner surface <b>210</b> of the lip <b>28</b>, if desired, to further increase the strength and structural integrity of the table top. The inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may be particularly advantageous in the corners <b>222</b> because the corners may be more likely to be damaged and the curved surfaces of the corners may have less strength than the straight edges of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to further increase the strength and structural integrity of the corners <b>222</b>, the radius of the corners may be increased because the strength and structural integrity of the corners increases with a larger radius of curvature. Preferably, the radius of curvature of the inner surface of the corner <b>222</b> is increased and one or more inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> are formed in the corner for added strength. It will be appreciated that the inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b> and/or ribs <b>220</b> may also be formed on the outer surfaces of the corners <b>222</b> and/or the other edges of the table top <b>12</b>. Other suitable embodiments for a table top with inwardly extending portions, outwardly extending portions and/or ribs are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/409,273 filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Edge and Corner for a Table Top, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 7</figref>, the inner surface <b>210</b> of lip <b>28</b> may also contain one or more handles <b>224</b> that are integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b>. The handles <b>224</b> allow the table <b>10</b> to be easily carried when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position. In particular, the handles <b>224</b> are preferably sized and configured to allow the user to grip the table <b>10</b> with one hand and the handles are preferably located at or near the center of the table top <b>12</b>. The handles <b>224</b> are preferably integrally formed in the lip <b>28</b> of the table top <b>12</b> so that the generally consistent pattern of depressions <b>30</b> in the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top is not disturbed, but the handles may be formed in any desired portion of the table top. Additionally, while the handles <b>224</b> are preferably integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b> as part of the blow-molded structure, the handles do not have to be integrally formed in the table top.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Significantly, the lip <b>28</b>, inwardly extending portions <b>216</b>, outwardly extending portions <b>218</b>, ribs <b>220</b> and handles <b>224</b> may be integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b>. Desirably, these features are integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b> during the blow-molding process. It will also be understood that other features of the table top <b>12</b> as discussed below in greater detail may also be integrally formed with table top <b>12</b>. For example, the depressions <b>30</b> and the various mounting portions brackets, clips, and receiving portions as disclosed herein may be integrally formed with table top <b>12</b>. Because these features may be integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b>, that may expedite the manufacturing process. These features, however, do not have to be integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b> and they could be attached to the table top by any suitable methods or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, table top <b>12</b> comprises a first table top section <b>256</b> and a separate second table top section <b>258</b>. First table top section <b>256</b> comprises an inside edge <b>260</b>, an outside edge <b>262</b> and opposing side edges <b>264</b> and <b>266</b> extending therebetween. Similarly, second table top section <b>258</b> includes an inside edge <b>268</b>, an outside edge <b>270</b>, and opposing side edges <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> extending therebetween. Inside edges <b>260</b> and <b>268</b> are adjacently disposed. It is appreciated that the structures that are discussed above with regard to table top <b>12</b> generally, are also applicable to table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>. In one embodiment, table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> are formed as separate and discrete members using the processes and materials as discussed above with regard to table top <b>12</b>. In an alternative embodiment, table top <b>12</b> can initially be formed as a single table top that is subsequently severed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Inside edge <b>260</b> of first table section <b>256</b> comprise an upper edge portion <b>276</b> which extends along upper surface <b>14</b> between side edges <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>. Inside edge <b>260</b> also comprises a lower edge portion <b>278</b> which is disposed between upper edge portion <b>276</b> and lower surface <b>16</b> and which also extends between side edges <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>. Upper edge portion <b>276</b> is substantially flat and linear. In contrast, lower edge portion <b>278</b> has a plurality of alternating grooves <b>280</b> recessed therein and tongues <b>282</b> projecting therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Inside edge <b>268</b> of second table top section <b>258</b> also includes an upper edge portion <b>284</b> and a lower edge portion <b>286</b> each extending between opposing sides <b>272</b> and <b>274</b>. Again, upper edge portion <b>284</b> is substantially flat while lower edge portion <b>286</b> has a plurality of alternating grooves <b>288</b> recessed therein and tongues <b>290</b> projecting therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As will be discussed below in greater detail, first table top section <b>256</b> and second table top section <b>258</b> are hingedly coupled together so that they can be selectively moved between a folded position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and an unfolded position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Tongues <b>282</b> of first table top section <b>256</b> are aligned with corresponding grooves <b>288</b> of second table top section <b>258</b>. Similarly, tongues <b>290</b> of second table top section <b>258</b> are aligned with corresponding grooves <b>280</b> of first table top section <b>256</b>. As a result, when table <b>10</b> is moved into the folded position, tongues <b>282</b> and <b>290</b> are received within corresponding grooves <b>280</b> and <b>288</b>, thereby interlocking table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> along inside edges <b>260</b> and <b>268</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.) This interlocking provides increased rigidity along insides edges <b>260</b> and <b>268</b> so as to prevent unwanted bending.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an alternative embodiment, instead of having both tongues and grooves along each of the insides edges <b>260</b> and <b>268</b>, all of the tongues can be positioned on one of the inside edges while all of the grooves can be placed on the other inside edge. In yet other embodiments, it is appreciated that the plurality of short tongues and grooves can be replaced with one or two elongated tongues and grooves. Furthermore, it is appreciated that the tongues and grooves can be a variety of different sizes, shapes, and configurations. In still other embodiments, it is appreciated that the tongues and grooves can be eliminated. In this embodiment, insides edges <b>260</b> and <b>268</b> can simply be flat so as to bias against each other or to be slightly spaced apart.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, table <b>10</b> further comprises a frame <b>32</b> connected to the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. The frame <b>32</b> includes two side rails <b>34</b> that extend along the length of the table top <b>12</b>. The side rails <b>34</b> are preferably positioned near opposing edges <b>26</b> of the table top. In particular, the side rails <b>34</b> are preferably disposed inwardly from the lip <b>28</b> such that there is a gap or space between the side rails and the lip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). The side rails <b>34</b> preferably extend almost the entire length of the table top <b>12</b> to provide increased strength and rigidity for the table top <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the side rails <b>34</b> may extend along only a portion of the length of the table top <b>12</b> and the side rails may not be required to provide increased strength or rigidity to the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The frame <b>32</b> is desirably constructed from metal, which may easily be formed into the desired configuration by known operations such as stamping and bending, and the metal may be coated or painted as desired. The frame <b>32</b> may also include one or more end rails attached to the ends of the side rails <b>34</b> and the frame may provide attachment points for the legs, as discussed in more detail below. While the frame <b>32</b> preferably includes two side rails <b>34</b> that are generally aligned in a parallel configuration, it will be appreciated that the frame may have other suitable configurations and arrangements depending, for example, upon the size and shape of the table top <b>12</b> or the intended use of the table <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each side rail <b>34</b> comprises an elongated first rail portion <b>294</b> designed for mounting on first table top section <b>256</b>, an elongated second rail portion <b>296</b> designed for mounting on second table top section <b>258</b>, and a hinge assembly <b>298</b> extending between rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b>. In one embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, each rail portion <b>294</b> and <b>296</b> of each side rail <b>34</b> has a generally U-shaped transverse cross section. Specifically, each rail portion includes an elongated first side wall <b>38</b>, an elongated second side wall <b>40</b>, and a connecting portion <b>42</b> extending between the lower ends of side walls <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>. An upper end of first side wall <b>38</b> terminates at an outwardly projecting engaging portion <b>44</b> while the upper end of second side wall <b>40</b> terminates at an outwardly projecting engaging portion <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment depicted, the engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> simply comprise the ends of the first side wall <b>38</b> and second side wall <b>40</b> being bent outwardly over an angle in a range between about 90&#xb0; to about 120&#xb0;. Other angles can also be used. As a result, each engaging portion <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> typically forms an inside angle less than about 90&#xb0; relative to the first and second side walls <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>, respectively. In the embodiment depicted, engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed so as to have a substantially smooth, rounded top surface <b>45</b> and a cupped bottom surface <b>47</b> that terminates at a sharpened edge <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b> of frame <b>32</b> are desirably connected to the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> by one or more frame mounting portions <b>36</b>. Frame mounting portions <b>36</b> allow the rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b> to be connected to the table top by a snap, friction or interference fit. Advantageously, the connection of the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b> does not require the use of mechanical fasteners such as bolts or screws, which desirably expedites the manufacturing or assembly process, but fasteners may be used if desired. Additionally, because screws, bolts and other types of mechanical fasteners are not required to attach the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b>, no holes or other types of stress concentrations are formed in the table top. Thus, the strength and structural integrity of the table top <b>12</b> is not compromised by drilling holes in the table top. In addition, because the frame <b>32</b> is preferably not bonded to the lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>, the table top <b>12</b> is not weakened or damaged by adhesive. Thus, strength and integrity of the table top <b>12</b> may be retained because the frame <b>32</b> is not screwed, bolted or bonded directly to lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top. Further, the attachment of the frame <b>32</b> to the frame mounting portions <b>36</b> may reduce the likelihood of deformation or damage to the table top <b>12</b>. Finally, the connection of the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b> without using mechanical fasteners or adhesive may facilitate assembly of the table <b>10</b> by the retailer or consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The frame mounting portions <b>36</b> are sized and configured to retain the rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b> in a generally fixed position and to prevent the unintended removal of the frame <b>32</b> from the table top <b>12</b>. The frame mounting portions <b>36</b> can be connected along the entire length of the side rails <b>34</b>. Advantageously, any forces acting on the table top <b>12</b> and/or the frame <b>32</b> are distributed over a large area. In contrast, conventional tables that attached the frame to the table top by mechanical fasteners distributed forces over a much smaller area, which makes conventional tables much more likely to fail. Therefore, the frame mounting portions <b>36</b> may provide a very secure attachment of the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b> even though mechanical fasteners are not required. In alternative embodiments it is appreciated that the frame mounting portions <b>36</b> can be spaced apart along side rails <b>34</b> or can be positioned only at desired locations so that only portions of the frame <b>32</b> are attached to the frame mounting portions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an elongated channel <b>50</b> is recessed on lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b> adjacent to each side edges <b>26</b>. Each channel <b>50</b> substantially extends the length of table top <b>12</b> and is adapted to receive a corresponding side rail <b>34</b>. A plurality of frame mounting portion <b>36</b> are formed at incrementally spaced apart on location along channels <b>50</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, each mounting portion <b>36</b> comprises a pair of opposing projections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> which project into channel <b>50</b> from opposing sides thereof. Each projection <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> extends between an opening <b>48</b> of channel <b>50</b> to a floor <b>55</b> of channel <b>50</b>. Each of projections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> bow centrally inward such that the minimum distance between projections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> is less than the maximum width between engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> on rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">During assembly, rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b> of each side rail <b>34</b> are pressed into a corresponding channel <b>50</b> on a select one of table sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.) As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, as side rail <b>34</b> is pressed into channel <b>50</b>, the rounded top surface <b>45</b> of engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> outwardly pushes or deflects projections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> so that engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be advanced to floor <b>55</b>. After engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> pass projections <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, the projections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> resiliently or elastically return to there respective original positions to secure engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and thus rail portions <b>294</b>, <b>296</b> within channels <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the side rails <b>34</b> may engage one or more corresponding surfaces within the channels <b>50</b> to help secure the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, sharp edges <b>52</b> are sized and configured to engage corresponding projections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> of the channel <b>50</b>. Advantageously, the sharp edges <b>52</b> engage and bite into the softer, blow-molded plastic material of the projections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> to allow the frame <b>32</b> to be securely connected to the table top <b>12</b>. Significantly, the engagement of the engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and the edges <b>52</b> to the projections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and/or the wall bounding channel <b>50</b> provides a large contact area between the frame <b>32</b> and the frame mounting portions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment one or more depressions <b>30</b> are preferably formed in the lower portion of the channel <b>50</b> so that a generally consistent, uniform pattern of depressions is formed in the table top <b>12</b>. Advantageously, this helps create a table top <b>12</b> with increased strength, structural integrity and generally uniform characteristics. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the depressions <b>30</b> could have other suitable arrangements and depressions do not have to be formed in the lower portion of the channel <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, because at least a portion of the side rails <b>34</b> are inserted into the recesses <b>50</b>, the side rails and the connecting portion <b>42</b> of the frame <b>32</b> do not extend a large distance away from the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. This may allow a table <b>10</b> with a low profile to be designed and manufactured. Significantly, if the height of the table top <b>12</b> is relatively small, then the tables <b>10</b> may be more easily stacked. This may assist in the shipping and storage of the tables <b>10</b>. Additionally, the lip <b>28</b> may have a height that is larger than or equal to the distance that the side rails <b>34</b> extend from the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> so that the frame is generally hidden from view when the table <b>10</b> is viewed from a plane generally aligned with the upper surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Advantageously, because the frame <b>32</b> may be completely or generally hidden from view, the frame does not have to be finished and it may contain visible imperfections or flaws. In addition, because the frame <b>32</b> may be completely or generally hidden from view by the lip <b>28</b>, a more aesthetically pleasing table <b>10</b> may be created. It will be appreciated, however, that the lip <b>28</b> does not have to hide all or a portion of the frame <b>32</b> from view.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in the accompanying figures, the frame <b>32</b> engages or abuts several different frame mounting portions <b>36</b> to securely attach the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b>. The engagement of the side rails <b>34</b> to several different frame mounting portions <b>36</b> over an extended length of channel <b>50</b> allows any forces or loads on the table top <b>12</b> and the frame <b>32</b> to be distributed over a large area, which helps prevent failure of the table <b>10</b>. Additionally, because the engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the side rails <b>34</b> preferably extend outwardly and are spaced wider apart than the opening <b>48</b> to the frame mounting portions <b>36</b>, a secure snap, friction or interference connection of the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b> may be established. Further, the side rails <b>34</b> and the frame mounting portions <b>36</b> are preferably generally symmetrical to help prevent undesirable twisting of the frame <b>32</b> and/or table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Advantageously, the frame <b>32</b> can be quickly and easily connected to the table top <b>12</b> by inserting the engaging portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the side rails <b>34</b> into the channel <b>50</b> and thus between the frame mounting portions <b>36</b>. As discussed above, mechanical fasteners such as screws or bolts are not required to connect the frame <b>32</b> to the table top <b>12</b>, but such fasteners may be used if desired. In addition, the frame <b>32</b> can be more easily disconnected from the table top <b>12</b>, if desired, because mechanical fasteners do not have to be removed. Other suitable embodiments for connecting a frame to a table top are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/409,259, filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Table with Frame That Can Be Attached to the Table Top without Mechanical Fasteners, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is appreciated that frame <b>32</b> can be mounted to table top <b>12</b> in a variety of different configurations. For example, fewer or more frame mounting portions <b>36</b> can be used than what is illustrated. For example, in one embodiment one frame mounting portion <b>36</b> can be formed on each end of each channel <b>50</b>. In yet another embodiment, each channel <b>50</b> can be formed as a single continuous frame mounting portion <b>36</b>. In other embodiments, frame mounting portion <b>36</b> can be eliminated. Each channel <b>50</b> can be sized to freely receive a side rail <b>34</b>. Mechanical fasteners such as screws, bolts, clamps and the like can then used to secure side rails <b>34</b> within channels <b>50</b>. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a flange <b>416</b> outwardly projects from side rail <b>34</b>. A screw <b>418</b> extends through flange <b>416</b> and engages with lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>. Flanges <b>416</b> can be used in conjunction with or separate from mounting portions <b>36</b>. In yet other embodiments, channels <b>50</b> can be eliminated. Fastening techniques such as adhesive, press fitting, mechanical fasteners, or the like can then be used to directly secure side rails <b>34</b> to lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each side rail <b>34</b> also comprises a hinge assembly <b>298</b>. Hinge assembly <b>298</b> comprises a first bracket <b>306</b> connected to the end of first rail portion <b>294</b> and a second bracket <b>308</b> connected to the end of second rail portion <b>296</b>. Brackets <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> have substantially the same configurations. Specifically, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> second bracket <b>308</b> comprises an elongated first arm <b>310</b> and an elongated second arm <b>312</b> each comprised of a flat metal plate. Arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are disposed in a spaced apart substantially parallel alignment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, each arm <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> has an upper edge <b>315</b> and a lower edge <b>317</b> that each extend between a first end <b>314</b> and an opposing second end <b>316</b>. First end <b>314</b> terminates at an end face <b>319</b>. A flange <b>318</b> outwardly projects along a portion of lower edge <b>317</b> between opposing ends <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>. Flange <b>318</b> is not required but increases the structural rigidity of arms <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> so as to prevent unwanted bending or flexing of arms <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a brace <b>320</b> extends between arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> along upper edges <b>315</b> at or toward first end <b>314</b>. Brace <b>320</b> connects arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> together and further increases the structural integrity thereof. As will be discussed below in greater detail, a tab <b>348</b> projects from brace <b>320</b> between arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, a hole <b>350</b> extends through tab <b>348</b>. Furthermore, a latching head <b>322</b> downwardly projects from lower edge <b>317</b> at first end <b>314</b> of each arm <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. A hole <b>330</b> centrally extends through each latching head <b>322</b>. Each latching head <b>322</b> terminates at a freely exposed, substantially semi-circular bearing surface <b>324</b>. Latching head <b>322</b> includes a catch <b>326</b> that projects beyond end face <b>319</b> of each arm <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>. Catch <b>326</b> is configured so that an L-shaped notch <b>238</b> is formed at the intersection of latching head <b>322</b> and end face <b>319</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, during assembly first bracket <b>306</b> and second bracket <b>308</b> are aligned end to end so that the latching heads <b>322</b> are overlapping and holes <b>330</b> extending through latching heads <b>322</b> are concentrically aligned. A pin <b>322</b> is then passed through each of holes <b>330</b> so as to hingedly connect brackets <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. Pin <b>322</b> can comprise a bolt, rivet, rod, or other conventional form of a pin. In the embodiment depicted, pin <b>322</b> comprises a rivet having opposing flared ends so as to retain the rivet in position. Second end <b>316</b> of arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> of first bracket <b>306</b> and second bracket <b>308</b> are mounted on opposing sides of first rail portion <b>294</b> and second rail portion <b>296</b>, respectively. This mounting can be by welding, adhesive, crimping or various mechanical fasteners such as bolts, screws, or the like. In yet other embodiments, brackets <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> can be integrally formed with rail portions <b>294</b> and <b>296</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Hinge assemblies <b>298</b> enable table top <b>12</b> to be selectively moved between the folded and unfolded positions as previously discussed. Specifically, as a result of hinge assemblies <b>298</b>, table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> can be independently rotated relative to the other so that table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> can be selectively moved between the folded and unfolded positions.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11A</figref>, mounted to one of the hinge assemblies <b>298</b> is a latch <b>334</b>. The latch <b>334</b> comprises a latch plate <b>336</b> having a front edge <b>338</b> and an opposing back edge <b>340</b>. Latch plate <b>336</b> is slidably disposed on spaced apart flanges <b>318</b> of second bracket <b>308</b>. An elongated finger <b>342</b> projects from front edge <b>338</b> of latch plate <b>336</b> and extends below pin <b>332</b>. In part, finger <b>342</b> acts in conjunction with pin <b>332</b> to retain latch <b>334</b> connected to hinge assembly <b>298</b>. Projecting from back edge <b>340</b> of latch plate <b>336</b> is a S-shaped handle <b>344</b>. Handle <b>344</b> bounds a pocket <b>346</b> which enables an operator to easily manually engage handle <b>344</b>. Handle <b>344</b> is disposed between arms <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> which function as guides for the latch <b>334</b>. Finally, projecting from the end of handle <b>344</b> is a post <b>352</b>. Post <b>352</b> extends through hole <b>350</b> in tab <b>348</b> of second bracket <b>308</b>. A spring <b>354</b> encircles post <b>352</b> and is biased between tab <b>348</b> and handle <b>344</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the above configuration, the latch <b>334</b> can be selectively moved between a retracted and advanced position. Specifically, by inserting a finger into pocket <b>346</b> of handle <b>344</b>, an operator can manually pull pack handle <b>344</b>, thereby compressing spring <b>354</b> and moving the latch <b>334</b> into the retracted position. When handle <b>344</b> is released, spring <b>354</b> resiliently biases the latch <b>334</b> back into the advanced position. In alternative embodiments, spring <b>354</b> can be replaced with other types of springs or other biasing members.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The latch <b>334</b> is used for rigidly locking together first table top section <b>256</b> and second table top section <b>258</b> when table <b>10</b> is in the unfolded position. Specifically, when table <b>10</b> is in the unfolded position, hinge assembly <b>298</b> is in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. In this position, notch <b>328</b> which is formed on each latching heads <b>322</b> of bracket <b>306</b> is aligned with latch plate <b>336</b>. Spring <b>354</b> thus biases latch plate <b>336</b> into each notch <b>328</b>. In this position, the latch <b>334</b> prevents table <b>10</b> from being moved into the folded position. That is, attempts to move table <b>10</b> into the folded position is prevented as a result of catches <b>326</b> of latching heads <b>322</b> catching against latch plate <b>336</b>. As a result, table <b>10</b> is selectively locked in the unfolded position. The latch <b>334</b> not only provides increased stability to table <b>10</b> during use but is also enable table <b>10</b> to be easily moved and manipulated while being retained in the unfolded position.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">To move table <b>10</b> to the folded position, the latch <b>334</b> is moved to the retracted position, as discussed above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, thereby removing latch plate <b>336</b> from notches <b>328</b>. In this position, table <b>10</b> can be moved to the folded position. It is noted that as soon as table <b>10</b> is at least partially folded, latch <b>334</b> can be released. Spring <b>354</b> now biases latch plate <b>336</b> against bearing surface <b>324</b>. Due to the arched configuration of bearing surface <b>324</b>, latch plate <b>336</b> freely slides along bearing surface <b>324</b> as table <b>10</b> is moved between the folded and unfolded positions. When table <b>10</b> is again moved to the fully unfolded position, latch plate <b>336</b> automatically snaps back into notches <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It is appreciated that hinge assemblies <b>298</b> can have a variety of different configurations. For example, in the depicted embodiment brackets <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> have substantially the same configuration for both hinge assemblies <b>298</b>. This is done to facilitate ease in manufacturing and production of table <b>10</b>. However, because latch <b>334</b> is only positioned on one of hinge assemblies <b>298</b>, the other hinge assembly need not have the structural elements that are designed to engage with latch <b>334</b>. For example, the latching heads <b>322</b> need not have the arched bearing surface <b>324</b> or catch <b>326</b>. In an alternative embodiment, however, a latch <b>334</b> could be positioned on each hinge assembly <b>298</b>. Furthermore, on the hinge assembly <b>298</b> having the latch <b>334</b>, only the latching heads <b>322</b> on the bracket opposite of the latch <b>334</b> engage latch <b>324</b>. As such, latching heads <b>322</b> on the bracket having latch <b>344</b> need not have the structural elements that are designed to engage with latch plate <b>336</b> of latch <b>334</b>. In still other embodiments, it is appreciated that hinge assembly <b>298</b> can comprise only one latching head <b>322</b> against which the latch <b>334</b> locks.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In yet other embodiments, it is appreciated that latch <b>334</b> need not be spring biased. That is, the latch <b>334</b> can be designed to be manually moved between the latched and unlatched position. In this embodiment the latch <b>334</b> may not ride against bearing surface <b>324</b> of latching heads <b>322</b>. As such, the perimeter surface of latching heads <b>322</b> can be any desired configuration. In addition, it is also appreciated that notch <b>328</b> need not be an L-shaped notch. In other embodiments, notch <b>328</b> can be U-shaped, V-shaped or have any other configuration in which latch plate <b>336</b> of latch <b>334</b> can be received. In this regard, it is appreciated that latch plate <b>336</b> can have a variety of different configurations that are designed to be received within notch <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment of the present invention, means are provided for directly locking the hinge assembly when the table top <b>12</b> is in the unfolded position. One embodiment of such means comprises the latch <b>334</b>. Alternative embodiments for such means includes the alternatives for latch <b>344</b> as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, table <b>10</b> also comprises a handle assembly <b>360</b> used in the handling and transport of table <b>10</b>. Handle assembly <b>360</b> comprises a handle <b>362</b> having a bracket <b>364</b> mounted thereto. Handle <b>362</b> is depicted as comprising an oblong loop but can be any other desired configuration which can be easily grasped by a user. For example, rather than forming a loop, handle <b>362</b> can comprises a plate having a lip outwardly projecting therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, bracket <b>364</b> comprises a base plate <b>366</b> having a forward end <b>368</b> and an opposing rearward end <b>370</b>. A first flange <b>372</b> extends from along forward end <b>368</b>. First flange <b>372</b> curves upward and forward. A Second flange <b>374</b> extends from along back edge <b>370</b>. Second flange <b>374</b> curves upward and inward. A portion of bottom wall <b>252</b> of table <b>12</b> comprises a mounting portion <b>376</b> which engages with bracket <b>364</b>. Mounting portion <b>376</b> is formed on bottom wall <b>252</b> of table top section <b>256</b> adjacent to inside edge <b>260</b>. Specifically, mounting portion <b>376</b> has a first end <b>378</b> which is bounded by a first channel <b>380</b>. A lip <b>382</b> projects into first channel <b>380</b> from a side opposite of mounting portion <b>376</b>. Mounting portion <b>376</b> also has a rounded second end <b>384</b> bounded by a second channel <b>386</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">During assembly, first flange <b>372</b> of bracket <b>364</b> is received within first channel <b>380</b> so that first flange <b>372</b> catches under lip <b>382</b>. Second flange <b>374</b> is lipped around rounded second end <b>384</b> of mounting portion <b>376</b>. A screw <b>388</b> is then screwed through base plate <b>366</b> of bracket <b>364</b> and into mounting portion <b>376</b>, thereby securing bracket <b>364</b> to mounting portion <b>376</b> both by interlocking engagement and mechanical fastener. In alternative embodiments, screw <b>388</b> can be replaced with an adhesive or other type of fastener. Furthermore, mounting portion <b>376</b> can be eliminated and a substantially flat bracket <b>364</b> can simply be mounted to the bottom wall <b>252</b> of table top section <b>256</b> by one or more fasteners such as screws, bolts or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Handle <b>362</b> is mounted to the forward end of base plate <b>366</b> such as by welding, fastener, or by being integrally formed with bracket <b>364</b>. In yet other embodiments, handle <b>362</b> can be hingedly mounted to bracket <b>364</b>. Handle <b>362</b> projects from bracket <b>364</b> at a slightly downward incline relative to a horizontally disposed upper surface <b>14</b> of table top <b>12</b>. The angle is selected so as to ensure that handle <b>362</b> does not interfere with table top section <b>258</b> when table <b>10</b> is moved into the folded position. In an alternative embodiment, depending on the configuration of lower surface <b>16</b>, handle <b>362</b> can also project in substantially parallel alignment with upper surface <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When table <b>12</b> is in the unfolded position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), handle <b>362</b> projects from table top section <b>256</b> so as to extend below adjacent table top section <b>258</b>. Accordingly, when table <b>10</b> is moved into the folded position as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a portion of handle <b>362</b> freely projects beyond the inside edges <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> of table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>. As a result, handle <b>362</b> can be easily grasped by a user without interference from the table top sections <b>256</b>, <b>258</b>. Although not required, it is also noted that the portion of lower surface <b>16</b> extending from inside edges <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> toward bracket <b>364</b> of both table top sections <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> is outwardly flared so as to further increase access to handle <b>362</b>. Handle <b>362</b> makes it easy for an individual to grasp onto and transport table <b>10</b> when in the folded position. Furthermore, by placing handle <b>362</b> adjacent to the inside edges as opposed to one of the outside edges, it is not necessary to secure the table top sections <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> together during use of the handle <b>362</b> since the table top sections <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> are held together by gravity. In addition, handle <b>362</b> is out of the way and thus not obstructive when table <b>10</b> is in the unfolded position. In alternative embodiments, it is appreciated that handle <b>362</b> need not be positioned adjacent to one of inside edges <b>260</b> or <b>262</b>. Rather, handle <b>362</b> can be mounted adjacent to any of the perimeter edges.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the side rails <b>34</b> of the frame <b>32</b> include openings <b>60</b> that are sized and configured to allow legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be attached to the table <b>10</b>. The legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are sized and configured to support the table top <b>12</b> above a surface such as a floor and the legs may be adjustable in length. The legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are preferably disposed between the side rails <b>34</b> of the frame and the openings <b>60</b> are preferably located near the ends of the side rails <b>34</b> in generally aligned pairs. It will be appreciated that the openings <b>60</b> could be positioned in any desired locations depending, for example, the configuration of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and/or the frame <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The openings <b>60</b> preferably have a non-circular configuration such as oval, oblong, egg-shaped, kidney-shaped, key-shaped, etc., which is sized and configured to receive a portion of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. The openings <b>60</b> include a length <b>66</b> that is generally aligned with the longitudinal length of the side rails <b>34</b> and a height <b>68</b> that is generally aligned with the height of the side rails <b>34</b>. It will be appreciated that one or more bushings, sleeves, bearings, and the like may be used in conjunction with openings <b>60</b> to facilitate the connection of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to the frame <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can be selectively moved between a collapsed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</figref>) in which the legs are positioned near the table top <b>12</b> for storage and transport and an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 13</figref>) in which the legs extend away from the table top <b>12</b>. Each leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> includes a connecting rod <b>70</b> that is sized and configured to be inserted into the openings <b>60</b> in the side rails <b>34</b> of the frame <b>32</b>. The rotation of the connecting rod <b>70</b> within the opening <b>60</b> allows the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to move between the extended and collapsed positions relative to the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 7</figref>, the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> includes receiving channels <b>72</b> that are sized and configured to receive at least a portion of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed position. The receiving channels <b>72</b> advantageously receive at least a portion of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to decrease the height of the table <b>10</b> in the collapsed position. This allows more tables <b>10</b> to be stacked and stored in a limited amount of space, and this may facilitate shipping and transportation of the tables. As shown in the accompanying figures, one or more depressions <b>30</b> are preferably located in the receiving channels <b>72</b> so that the consistent pattern and arrangement of depressions is maintained. It will be appreciated, however, that depressions <b>30</b> do not have to be formed in the receiving channels <b>72</b> and receiving channels do not have to be formed in the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the connecting rod <b>70</b> preferably has a non-circular cross-sectional configuration and the openings <b>60</b> in the side rails <b>34</b> of the frame <b>32</b> also preferably have a non-circular configuration. For example, the openings <b>60</b> and the connecting rod <b>70</b> may have a configuration that is oval, oblong, egg-shaped, kidney-shaped, key-shaped, etc. Desirably, the non-circular opening <b>60</b> and the non-circular cross-sectional configuration of the connecting rod <b>70</b> are sized and configured such that the connecting rod <b>70</b> is not securely held within the openings <b>60</b> when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position. Thus, in the collapsed position, one or more small gaps or spaces are located between connecting rod <b>70</b> and the opening <b>60</b> so that the connecting rod <b>70</b> can move slightly within the openings <b>60</b>. Advantageously, this allows the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be more easily connected to the side rails <b>34</b> because of the larger clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Additionally, because there is some movement or &#x201c;play&#x201d; between the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the side rails <b>34</b> when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position, that may allow the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to fold flatter such that the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> contact and/or are generally parallel to the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Further, the movement of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> within the openings <b>60</b> may allow the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be positioned in the desired collapsed position even if, for example, there is some slight imperfection in the table <b>10</b> or if a portion of the table <b>10</b> has expanded or contracted due to temperature. Accordingly, the tables <b>10</b> may be more easily manufactured and assembled because of the greater tolerances, and the tables <b>10</b> may fold flatter to facilitate stacking of the tables <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the extended position, however, the connecting rod <b>70</b> is preferably securely held within the openings <b>60</b> to rigidly and securely attach the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to the table top <b>12</b>. In particular, when the connecting rod <b>70</b> is rotated within the openings <b>60</b> to the extended position, the connecting rod <b>70</b> and openings <b>60</b> are sized and configured such that there is no or very little movement or play between the connecting rod <b>70</b> and the openings <b>60</b>. Thus, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> desirably do not shake or wobble in the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, the openings <b>60</b> in the side rail <b>34</b> may have a height of about 0.94 ( 15/16) inches and an overall length of about 1.5 inches, and the connecting rod <b>70</b> may have an oval configuration with a height of about 0.94 ( 15/16) inches and a width of about 0.75 (&#xbe;) inches. Advantageously, these sizes and configurations allow the connecting rod <b>70</b> to be relatively easily inserted into the openings <b>60</b> and the connecting rod <b>70</b> can move slightly within the openings <b>60</b> when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position. In particular, as perhaps best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the connecting rod <b>70</b> can move within the opening <b>60</b> because there are gaps or spaces between the connecting rod <b>70</b> and the opening <b>60</b>. On the other hand, when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the extended position, the connecting rod <b>70</b> is securely held within the opening <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the upper and lower ends of the connecting rod <b>70</b> engage the upper and lower portions of the opening <b>60</b> when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It will be appreciated that the openings <b>60</b> and connecting rod <b>70</b> can have other suitable sizes and configurations depending, for example, upon the size and/or intended use of the table <b>10</b>. It will also be appreciated that other suitable combinations of the openings <b>60</b> and connecting rod <b>70</b> may be utilized, such as the combination of generally circular openings and non-circular connecting rods, or non-circular openings and generally circular connecting rods. Further, it will be appreciated that the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be attached to the frame <b>32</b> or table top <b>12</b> by other suitable types of devices and mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are attached to or include the connecting rod <b>70</b>. Legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> further include a pair of elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and a foot portion <b>78</b>. Advantageously, the two separate elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may help prevent twisting or torque on the connection of the support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to the connecting rod <b>70</b> and the foot portion <b>78</b>. Additionally, while the elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are preferably welded to the connecting rod <b>70</b> and the foot portion <b>78</b>, the support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be connected to the connecting rod <b>70</b> and foot portion <b>78</b> by any suitable method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> preferably have a generally curved configuration. In particular, the upper portions of the elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are preferably spaced apart to provide a secure attachment of the support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to the connecting rod <b>70</b>, the middle portions of the elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are preferably more closely spaced together, and the lower portions of the elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are spaced apart to provide a secure connection to the foot portion <b>78</b>. The foot portion <b>78</b> preferably has an upwardly extending curved section and feet <b>82</b> may be connected to the ends of the foot portion. A connecting member <b>80</b> is preferably disposed near the middle portion of the elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to help maintain the support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> in the desired positions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The connecting rod <b>70</b>, elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and foot portion <b>78</b> of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are desirably constructed from hollow metal tubes because the metal tubes are relatively lightweight and strong. The hollow metal tubes forming the connecting rod <b>70</b>, elongated support members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and foot portion <b>78</b> desirably have a generally oval configuration to provide increased strength. Advantageously, the oval configuration may also be used to create a thinner profile for the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, which may create a thinner profile for the table <b>10</b> when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It will be appreciated that the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be constructed from other materials with the suitable characteristics and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may have other shapes and configurations depending, for example, upon the intended use of the table <b>10</b>. For example, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may include only a single elongated support member or multiple elongated support members, and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be constructed as a single component or multiple components that are connected together. It will further be appreciated that the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> need not be in pivotal engagement with frame <b>32</b> or the table top <b>12</b> to be collapsible. For example, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be detachably connected to the table top <b>12</b> such that when it is desired to collapse the table <b>10</b> for storage, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are detached from the table top <b>12</b>. Other suitable embodiments for connecting legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to a table top <b>12</b> are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/408,917, file Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Pivotal Connection of a Table Leg to a Frame, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, support brace <b>84</b> is used to support each leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the extended position. Each support brace <b>84</b> includes a first end <b>86</b> that is attached to a corresponding leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and a second end <b>88</b> that is attached to the table top <b>12</b> by a mounting member or bracket <b>90</b>. Each support brace <b>84</b> is preferably pivotally connected to the corresponding leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the bracket <b>90</b> to allow the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be moved between the extended and collapsed positions. It will be appreciated that while the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the extended or collapsed positions, the support braces <b>84</b> are also in a corresponding extended or collapsed position. Advantageously, the support braces <b>84</b> can be connected to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the brackets <b>90</b> without the use of mechanical fasteners such as screws, rivets or bolts. Significantly, the table <b>10</b> may be built more quickly because fewer components may be required to assemble the table <b>10</b> and no mechanical fasteners are needed to attach the support braces <b>84</b> to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> or the table top <b>12</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that one or more mechanical fasteners may be used to connect the support braces <b>84</b> to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and/or the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In greater detail, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, the first end <b>86</b> of each support brace <b>84</b> includes two curved arms <b>92</b> and each curved arm has an opening <b>94</b> that leads to a generally circular interior portion <b>96</b>. The two generally circular interior portions <b>96</b> are generally aligned along the same axis and disposed at the end <b>86</b> of the support brace <b>84</b>. The generally circular interior portions <b>96</b> are sized and configured to receive corresponding receiving portions <b>98</b> formed in the connecting member <b>80</b>. In particular, the receiving portions <b>98</b> include a flange <b>100</b> with rounded ends <b>102</b> and corresponding openings <b>104</b>. The support braces <b>84</b> are connected to the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> by disposing the rounded ends <b>102</b> of the flange <b>100</b> within the generally circular interior portions <b>96</b> of the curved arms <b>92</b>. In addition, the curved arms <b>92</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> are disposed within the openings <b>104</b> in the connecting member <b>80</b>. Advantageously, when the support braces <b>0</b>.<b>84</b> are connected to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the table top <b>12</b>, the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be inadvertently disconnected from the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. While this connection of the support braces <b>84</b> to the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> does not require that use of any mechanical fasteners, it will be appreciated that mechanical fasteners may be used to connect the support braces <b>84</b> to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In order to attach the support braces <b>84</b> to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, the two generally circular interior portions <b>96</b> of the curved arms <b>92</b> are coaxially aligned with the rounded ends <b>102</b> of the flange <b>100</b>. The rounded ends <b>102</b> of the flange <b>100</b> are then inserted into the generally circular interior portions <b>96</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> and the arms <b>92</b> are inserted into the openings <b>104</b> in the flange. Significantly, when the second end <b>88</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> are attached to the table top <b>12</b>, the first end <b>86</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be disconnected from the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. This helps create a strong and secure table <b>10</b> because the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be unintentionally disconnected from legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> when the table <b>10</b> is assembled. However, when the second end <b>88</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> is disconnected from the table <b>10</b>, then the first end <b>86</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> can be disconnected from the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. This allows the table <b>10</b> to be quickly and easily assembled, and it allows the table to be quickly and easily disassembled.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The brackets <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) are connected to the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> by bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) that allow the brackets <b>90</b> to be connected to the table top <b>12</b> by a snap, friction or interference fit. Advantageously, the connection of the brackets <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b> does not require the use of mechanical fasteners such as bolts or screws, which desirably expedites the manufacturing or assembly process, but fasteners may be used if desired. Additionally, because screws, bolts or other types of mechanical fasteners are not required to attach the brackets <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b>, no holes or other types of stress concentrations are formed in the table top. Thus, the strength and structural integrity of the table top <b>12</b> is not diminished by drilling or forming holes in the table top <b>12</b>. In addition, because the brackets <b>90</b> are preferably not glued to the lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>, the table top <b>12</b> is not weakened or damaged by adhesive. Thus, strength and integrity of the table top <b>12</b> may be retained because the brackets <b>90</b> are not screwed, bolted or bonded to bottom surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Further, the connection of the brackets <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b> without using mechanical fasteners or adhesives may facilitate assembly of the table <b>10</b> by the retailer or consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> are sized and configured to retain the brackets <b>90</b> in generally fixed positions and to prevent the unintended removal of the brackets from the table top <b>12</b>. Advantageously, the brackets <b>90</b> engage a relatively large portion of the table top <b>12</b> so that forces applied to the brackets <b>90</b> are distributed over a large area. This provides an improved and more secure connection of the brackets <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b> because forces are distributed over a much larger area than brackets <b>90</b> attached to a table top only by mechanical fasteners. Additionally, the connection of the brackets <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b> by the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> may be less likely to fail than conventional brackets attached to a table top by mechanical fasteners because of the larger engagement area.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the bracket <b>90</b> includes a main body portion <b>112</b> with a first end <b>114</b> and a second end <b>116</b>. The first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> includes an engaging portion <b>118</b> with a rounded flange <b>120</b> and an edge <b>122</b>. The second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> includes a retaining portion <b>124</b> with a first angled portion <b>126</b> and a second angled portion <b>128</b>. The first angled portion <b>126</b> is preferably disposed at an angle less than about 90&#xb0; with respect to the main body portion <b>112</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> so that it is angled towards the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>. As discussed below, the engaging portion <b>118</b> and the retaining portion <b>124</b> are sized and configured to securely attach the bracket <b>90</b> to bracket mounting portion <b>110</b> by a snap, friction or interference fit. Additionally, the bracket <b>90</b> is preferably directly attached to the table top <b>12</b> because the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> are desirably integrally formed in the table top <b>12</b> as part of a unitary, one-piece structure. It will be appreciated, however, that the bracket <b>90</b> does not have to be directly attached to the table top <b>12</b> and the bracket does not have to be attached to the table top <b>12</b> by the bracket mounting portions <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The bracket mounting portion <b>110</b> includes a first recess <b>130</b> and a second recess <b>132</b> that are sized and configured to receive the first end <b>114</b> and the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>, respectively. In particular, the first recess <b>130</b> is disposed towards the middle of the table top <b>12</b> and the first recess <b>130</b> preferably has a length that is approximately the same as the length of the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>. A protrusion or lip <b>134</b> projects into an upper portion of the first recess <b>130</b> and it is sized and configured to fit within the inner portion of the rounded flange <b>120</b> on the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>. The second recess <b>132</b> is disposed towards the end of the table top <b>12</b> and it has a length that is approximately the same as the length of the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>. A protrusion or lip <b>136</b> extends into an upper portion of the second recess <b>132</b> and it is sized and configured to contact or abut at least a portion of the first downwardly extending portion <b>126</b> on the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b>. The distance from the first edge <b>122</b> on the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> to the innermost part of the first downwardly extending portion <b>126</b> on the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is preferably smaller than the distance from the protrusion <b>134</b> extending into the first recess <b>130</b> to the protrusion <b>136</b> extending into the second recess <b>132</b> of the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b>. This allows the bracket <b>90</b> to be connected to the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b> by a snap, friction or interference fit.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In order to connect the bracket <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b>, the engaging portion <b>118</b> on the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is inserted into the first recess <b>130</b> of the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b> such that the rounded flange <b>120</b> and the edge <b>122</b> engage a portion of the table top <b>12</b>. In particular, the edge <b>122</b> preferably engages a portion of the first recess <b>130</b> and/or the protrusion <b>134</b> and the rounded flange <b>120</b> contacts or abuts at least a portion of the protrusion. The second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is then inserted into the second recess <b>132</b> of the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b>. As the retaining portion <b>124</b> on the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is inserted into the second recess <b>132</b>, the first angled portion <b>126</b> and/or the protrusion <b>136</b> deflects or deforms to allow the second end of the bracket to be inserted into the second recess <b>132</b>. Once the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is inserted into the second recess <b>132</b>, the first angled portion <b>126</b> and/or the protrusion <b>136</b> resiliently or elastically returns to there original positions to secure the second end of the bracket <b>90</b> in a fixed position. Accordingly, the bracket <b>90</b> is preferably connected to the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b> of the table top <b>12</b> by a snap, friction or interference fit, and this allows the bracket <b>90</b> to be securely connected to the table top <b>12</b> without the use of fasteners. It will be appreciated, however, that fasteners or adhesives could also be used to secure the bracket <b>90</b> to the table top <b>12</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The rounded flange <b>120</b> on the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> preferably has a radius of curvature that generally corresponds to the radius of curvature of the protrusion <b>134</b> to help secure the bracket <b>90</b> to the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b>. Similarly, the first angled portion <b>126</b> on the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> preferably has a radius of curvature that generally corresponds to the radius of curvature of the protrusion <b>136</b>. This provides a large contact area between the bracket <b>90</b> and the bracket mounting portion <b>110</b>. Additionally, the edge <b>122</b> on the first end <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> is preferably sharp so that it engages and bites into the softer, blow-molded plastic material of the table top <b>12</b> to allow the bracket <b>90</b> to be securely connected to the table top. Significantly, the engagement of the first end <b>114</b> and the second end <b>116</b> of the bracket <b>90</b> to the first recess <b>130</b> and the second recess <b>132</b> of the bracket mounting member <b>110</b>, respectively, provides a large contact area that allows forces or loads on bracket to be distributed over a large area, which helps provide a secure and durable connection of the support brace <b>84</b> to the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> are formed in the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and one or more depressions <b>30</b> may be formed in the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> so that a generally consistent, uniform pattern of depressions is formed in the table top <b>12</b>. Significantly, all or only a portion of the depressions <b>30</b> may be formed in the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b> in order to maintain the generally uniform pattern of depressions. Advantageously, the uniform pattern of depressions <b>30</b> may help create a table top <b>12</b> with increased strength, structural integrity and generally uniform characteristics. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the depressions <b>30</b> could have other suitable arrangements and depressions do not have to be formed in the bracket mounting portions <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As discussed above, the second end <b>88</b> of each support brace <b>84</b> is connected to a corresponding bracket <b>90</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 17</figref>, the second end <b>88</b> of each support brace <b>84</b> includes two curved arms <b>93</b> and each curved arm <b>93</b> has an opening <b>95</b> that leads to a generally circular interior portion <b>97</b>. The two generally circular interior portions <b>97</b> are generally aligned along the same axis and disposed near the end of the support braces <b>84</b>. The generally circular interior portions <b>97</b> are sized and configured to be connected to the second end <b>116</b> of the brackets <b>90</b>. In particular, the generally circular interior portions <b>97</b> are sized and configured to receive a portion of the first angled portion <b>126</b> and the second angled portion <b>128</b> of the brackets <b>90</b>. In addition, the curved arms <b>93</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> are configured to be disposed within openings <b>99</b> in the second end <b>116</b> of the brackets <b>90</b>. Advantageously, when the support braces <b>84</b> are connected to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the table top <b>12</b>, the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be inadvertently disconnected from the brackets <b>90</b>. While this connection of the support braces <b>84</b> to the brackets <b>90</b> does not require that use of any mechanical fasteners, it will be appreciated that mechanical fasteners may be used to connect the support braces <b>84</b> to the brackets <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In order to attach the support braces <b>84</b> to the brackets <b>90</b>, the two generally circular interior portions <b>97</b> of the curved arms <b>93</b> are coaxially aligned with the first angled portion <b>126</b> and the second angled portion <b>128</b> on the second end <b>116</b> of the brackets <b>90</b>. The first angled portion <b>126</b> and the second angled portion <b>128</b> are then inserted into the generally circular interior portions <b>97</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> and the curved arms <b>93</b> are inserted into the openings <b>99</b> in the second end <b>116</b> of the brackets <b>90</b>. Significantly, when the support braces <b>84</b> are connected to the brackets <b>90</b> and the brackets <b>90</b> is connected to the table top <b>12</b>, the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be disconnected from the brackets <b>90</b>. This helps create a strong and secure table <b>10</b> because the support braces <b>84</b> cannot be unintentionally disconnected from brackets <b>90</b> when the table <b>12</b> is assembled. However, when the brackets <b>90</b> are disconnected from the table top <b>12</b>, then the second end <b>88</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> can be disconnected from the bracket <b>90</b>. This allows the table <b>10</b> to be quickly and easily assembled and disassembled.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As discussed above, the first end <b>86</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> may be pivotally connected to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and the second end <b>88</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> may be pivotally connected to the brackets <b>90</b>. One skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the ends <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> of the support braces <b>84</b> do not have to be pivotally connected to the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> or the brackets <b>90</b>. Other suitable embodiments for connecting the support braces to the legs and/or the table top are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/409,469, filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Pivotal Connection of a Support Brace to a Table Leg and Table Top, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>, each support brace <b>84</b> includes a first arm <b>140</b> that is pivotally connected to a second arm <b>142</b> by a pin <b>144</b>. The pivotal connection of the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> allows each support brace <b>84</b> to move between the extended position and the collapsed position. When each support brace <b>84</b> is in the collapsed position, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are also in the collapsed position. Similarly, when each support brace <b>84</b> is in the extended position, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are also in the extended position. While the support braces <b>84</b> preferably pivot to allow the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be moved between the extended position and the collapsed position, it will be understood that the support braces <b>84</b> do not require the pivotal connection of the first arm <b>140</b> and the second arm <b>142</b>, and the support braces <b>84</b> could have other suitable arrangements and/or configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A locking mechanism <b>146</b> is preferably used to secure each support brace <b>84</b> in the extended position, which consequently also secures the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the extended position. Advantageously, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> can secure the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the extended position regardless of the position or orientation of the table <b>10</b>. Thus, the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> will not move from the extended position to the collapsed position even if the table <b>10</b> is turned on its side or upside-down. In addition, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is preferably biased to remain in the locked position and the locking mechanism positively locks the support braces <b>84</b> and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the extended position. Further, the locking mechanism <b>140</b> preferably requires the user to intentionally unlock the mechanism to allow the support brace <b>84</b> and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to move into the collapsed position. Thus, the support brace <b>84</b> and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can be positively held in the extended position by the locking mechanism <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> includes an elongated body <b>148</b> that is generally sized and configured to fit within the second arm <b>142</b> of the corresponding support brace <b>84</b>. In particular, the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> has a generally U-shaped configuration with two opposing sidewalls <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> and the elongated body <b>148</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is generally disposed between the sidewalls and towards the end of the second arm nearest the first arm <b>140</b>. The elongated body <b>148</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b> includes a first end <b>154</b> that is sized and configured to engage the pin <b>144</b> and a second end <b>156</b> with an elongated extension <b>158</b>. Two outwardly extending tabs or flanges <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are disposed between the ends <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b> and the tabs extend through an opening <b>164</b> in the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b>. The elongated extension <b>158</b> on the second end <b>156</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b> extends through an opening <b>166</b> in a flange <b>168</b> extending from the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b>. A biasing member such as a spring <b>170</b> is disposed about the elongated extension <b>158</b> and the biasing member is positioned between the flange <b>168</b> and the elongated body <b>148</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The locking mechanism <b>146</b> is movable relative to the second arm <b>142</b> between a locked position in which the elongated body <b>148</b> is disposed proximate the end of the second arm nearest the first arm <b>140</b>, and an unlocked position in which the elongated body <b>148</b> is disposed inwardly from the end of the second arm and away from the first arm. The spring <b>170</b> is desirably sized and configured to bias the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the locked position. In this locked position, the first end <b>154</b> of the elongated body <b>148</b> contacts the pin <b>144</b> and the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are disposed towards the end of the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b>. In the unlocked position, the first end <b>154</b> of the elongated body <b>148</b> is spaced apart from the pin <b>144</b> and the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are spaced away from the end of the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other suitable types of biasing mechanisms may be used to bias the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> are generally aligned and at least a portion of the arms overlap when the support brace <b>84</b> is in the extended position. In particular, the first arm <b>140</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> includes two extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> and the extensions are generally parallel to and overlap portions of the sidewalls <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the second arm <b>142</b> when the support brace <b>84</b> is in the extended position. When the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is in the locked position, the locking mechanism maintains the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> in the generally parallel and overlapping position with the sidewalls <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the second arm <b>142</b>. Specifically, the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> engage the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> to prevent the first arm <b>140</b> from moving relative to the second arm <b>142</b>. Thus, the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> prevent the first arm <b>140</b> from pivoting relative to the second arm <b>142</b>, and that maintains the support braces <b>84</b> and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">On the other hand, when the support braces <b>84</b> are in the collapsed position, the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> do not overlap portions of the sidewalls <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the second arm <b>142</b> of the support braces <b>84</b>. In contrast, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> are spaced away from the second arm <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> and at least a portion of the second arm may be disposed inside the body of the first arm <b>140</b> to form a small, compact arrangement. Advantageously, the support brace <b>84</b> does not significantly protrude from the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> in the collapsed position. This allows a table <b>10</b> with a relatively small height when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position to be constructed, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">When the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is in the unlocked position, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> does not secure the support brace <b>84</b> in the extended position. In contrast, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> allows the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> to freely move with respect to each other. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, when the user moves the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the unlocked position, the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> no longer engage the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> and that allows the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the support brace <b>84</b> to freely rotate. Desirably, when the user releases the locking mechanism <b>146</b>, the spring <b>170</b> causes the locking mechanism <b>146</b> to return to its locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>20</b> and <b>121</b>, the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> have a curved front surface <b>176</b> and a generally straight rear surface <b>178</b> to positively secure the locking mechanism <b>146</b> in the locked position, and to allow the support brace <b>84</b> to be moved from the collapsed position to the extended position without the user unlocking the locking mechanism <b>146</b>. In particular, the curved front surfaces <b>176</b> of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> are sized and configured to engage the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> of the locking mechanism <b>146</b> when the support brace <b>84</b> is moved from the collapsed position to the extended position. Specifically, the curved front surfaces <b>176</b> engage the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and push the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the unlocked position. When the support brace <b>84</b> is in the extended position and the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are generally aligned, the curved front surface <b>176</b> of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> no longer engage the tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and the spring <b>170</b> returns the locking mechanism <b>146</b> to the locked position. Thus, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> allows the support brace <b>84</b> to be moved from the collapsed position to the extended position without requiring the user to unlock the locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The generally straight rear surfaces <b>178</b> of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> prevent the locking mechanism <b>146</b> from being inadvertently unlocked and allowing the support braces <b>84</b> to move from the extended position to the collapsed position. In particular, the generally straight rear surfaces <b>178</b> of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> engage the generally planar lower surfaces of the tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, and this engagement of the extensions and tabs prevents the support braces <b>84</b> from moving from the extended position to the collapsed position. In order to allow the support braces <b>84</b> to move from the extended position to the collapsed position, the user must intentionally unlock the locking mechanism <b>146</b>, and this allows the support braces and the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Significantly, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is lightweight and includes few moving parts. In particular, the locking mechanism <b>146</b> is preferably constructed from metal and it can be stamped or formed into the desired configuration. Additionally, the second arm <b>140</b> is preferably constructed from metal and the opening <b>164</b>, opening <b>166</b> and flange <b>168</b> can be stamped or formed into the desired configuration. While the first arm <b>140</b>, second arm <b>142</b> and the locking mechanism <b>146</b> are preferably unitary components, it will be appreciated that these components may be constructed from multiple parts that are connected together. Further, these components may have other suitable configurations and arrangements depending, for example, upon the size and/or intended use of the table <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In operation of the locking mechanism <b>146</b>, when the second arm <b>142</b> is in the collapsed position and being rotated into the extended position, the curved front surfaces <b>176</b> of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> engage the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. The rotation of the second arm <b>142</b> relative to the first arm <b>140</b> causes the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> to push the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and the locking member <b>146</b> into the unlocked position. When the support braces <b>84</b> are in the extended position, the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> no longer engage the outwardly extending tabs <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and the spring <b>170</b> forces the locking member <b>146</b> into the locked position. Alternatively, instead of the extensions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> moving the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the unlocked position while the support braces <b>84</b> are being moved from the collapsed position to the extended position, the user may manually move the locking mechanism into the unlocked position. In order to move the support braces <b>84</b> and legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> from the extended position to the collapsed position, the user slides the locking mechanism <b>146</b> into the unlocked position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, which allows the second arm <b>142</b> to rotate relative to the first arm <b>140</b>. Once the arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are not longer in the extended position, the user can release the locking mechanism <b>146</b> and position the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed position. Other suitable types of locking mechanisms for retaining table legs in an extended position are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/408,949, filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Table Leg Locking Mechanism, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a retainer <b>392</b> is used to help secure table <b>10</b> in the folded position. Retainer <b>392</b> is mounted to one of connecting rods <b>70</b>. Specifically, retainer <b>392</b> comprises a tubular body <b>394</b> having a flange <b>396</b> mounted on one side and a clip <b>398</b> mounted on a side opposing the flange <b>396</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, body <b>394</b> has an interior surface <b>400</b> that bounds an opening <b>402</b>. Connecting rod <b>70</b> extends through opening <b>402</b> such that flange <b>396</b> is disposed adjacent to or against lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>. In the embodiment depicted, flange <b>396</b> has a substantially flat plate-like configuration. Flange <b>396</b> is configured such that forces tending to rotate retainer <b>392</b> about connecting rod <b>70</b> are countered by flange <b>396</b> biasing against lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>. As such, flange <b>396</b> assists in preventing rotation of retainer <b>392</b> about connecting rod <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As illustrated, opening <b>402</b> is larger than the transverse cross section of connecting rod <b>70</b>. Furthermore, opening <b>402</b> is not round but is rather non-symmetrical. Opening <b>402</b> has a configuration that allows connecting rod <b>70</b> to selectively rotate within opening <b>402</b> yet retain flange <b>396</b> adjacent to lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>. More specifically, opening <b>402</b> of body <b>394</b> has a generally L-shaped configuration which includes a horizontal channel <b>406</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and a vertical channel <b>408</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) which have a common overlapping section. Channels <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> each have a transverse cross section that is substantially complementary to the transverse cross section of connecting rod <b>70</b>. An inside corner <b>404</b> of body <b>402</b> partially separates channels <b>406</b> and <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As previously discussed, in the embodiment depicted each connecting rod <b>70</b> has a substantially elliptical transverse cross sectional configuration. When legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, connecting rod <b>70</b> is horizontally disposed within horizontal channel <b>406</b>. Although a gap is formed between connecting rod <b>70</b> and the upper end of body <b>402</b>, inside corner <b>404</b> holds retainer <b>392</b> relatively stationary relative to connecting rod <b>70</b> so that flange <b>396</b> is retained adjacent to lower surface <b>16</b> of table top <b>12</b>. As legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are rotated to the extended position, connecting rod <b>70</b> rotates into vertical channel <b>408</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Retainer <b>392</b> is comprised of a resiliently deformable material, such as plastic. As such, inside corner <b>404</b> flexes outward and then resiliently rebounds as legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are moved between the extended and collapsed positions. Again, during rotation of connection rod <b>70</b>, flange <b>396</b> biases against table top <b>12</b> to prevent rotation of retainer <b>392</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">When table top <b>12</b> is moved into the folded position, the other connection rod <b>70</b> not disposed within body <b>394</b> is snap fit into clip <b>398</b>. That is, clip <b>398</b> comprises a pair of resiliently deformable rounded arms <b>410</b> that project from body <b>394</b>. Arms <b>410</b> bound a gap between the free ends thereof. As retention rod <b>70</b> is advanced into the gap so as to bias against arms <b>410</b>, arms <b>410</b> flex outwardly and then resiliently snap fit around retention rod <b>70</b>, thereby releasably engaging with the retention rod <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">It is appreciated that one or more retainers <b>392</b> can be used. Because retainer <b>392</b> is prevented from rotating, retainer <b>392</b> is always properly aligned for engagement with the other connection rod <b>70</b>. Retainer <b>392</b> releasably holds together table top sections <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> at the ends opposite of hinge assemblies <b>298</b> when table top <b>12</b> is in the folded position. As a result of this secure coupling, folded table <b>10</b> can be more easily carried, transport, and stored without unintentional unfolding. Another advantage of retainer <b>392</b> is that it is mounted to table <b>10</b> without the use of mechanical fasteners which can potentially slow production and weaken the structure. Alternatively, mechanical fasteners can be used to secure retainer <b>392</b>. In yet other embodiments, it is appreciated that retainer <b>392</b> is not required or that retainer <b>392</b> can be replaced with other connecting structures.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">It is appreciated that retainer <b>392</b> can have a variety of different configurations. For example, flange <b>396</b> can comprise one or more flanges that can come in a variety of different sizes, shapes, and configurations. The function of flange <b>396</b> is simply to help prevent rotation of retainer <b>392</b> so that clip <b>398</b> is always properly aligned. It is also appreciated that opening <b>402</b> of body <b>394</b> can have a variety of different configurations. Such shapes can depend on the transverse cross sections of connection rods <b>70</b>. For example, where connection rod <b>70</b> has round transverse cross section, opening <b>402</b> can be round and thus symmetrical.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>, one or more clips <b>180</b> are desirably attached to the table top <b>12</b> and the clips are sized and configured to hold the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed or storage position. In particular, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the clips <b>180</b> receive and retain the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> such that the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are generally parallel to and proximate the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Desirably, at least a portion of the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are located within the channels <b>72</b> formed in the lower surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> so that the height of the table top <b>12</b> can be minimized when the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are in the collapsed position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a single clip <b>180</b> may be used to receive and retain each leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed position. It will be appreciated, however, that any suitable number of clips <b>180</b> may be used to retain the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed position. It will also be appreciated that the table <b>10</b> does not require the clip <b>180</b> to secure the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the collapsed position and other suitable devices may be used to secure the legs in the collapsed position. For example, one or more securing members as disclosed in Assignee's U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,331, entitled Portable Folding Utility Table with Integral Receiving Members, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, may be used to secure the legs in the collapsed position.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>, the clip <b>180</b> includes a body <b>182</b> that is sized and configured to be inserted into a corresponding receiving portion <b>184</b> formed in the table top <b>12</b>. In one embodiment receiving portion <b>184</b> has the same general size and shape as one of the depressions <b>30</b>. Thus, while the receiving portion <b>184</b> may be placed in any suitable location, it is desirably positioned so that it does not interrupt or disturb the generally uniform pattern of depressions <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the receiving portion <b>184</b> may allow the table top <b>12</b> to be constructed with generally uniform characteristics, such as generally consistent strength and structural integrity, because the receiving portion may act or function similar to one of the depressions <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The clip <b>180</b> includes a leg receiving portion <b>186</b> that is sized and configured to receive and retain a leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the table <b>10</b>. The leg receiving portion <b>186</b> preferably receives and retains the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in a snap, friction or interference fit. In particular, the leg receiving portion <b>186</b> includes an opening <b>188</b> that is smaller than the corresponding portion of the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> that is intended to be received by the receiving portion. Thus, when the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> is inserted into the opening <b>188</b>, the clip <b>180</b> deforms to increase the size of the opening and allow the leg to be inserted into the leg receiving portion <b>186</b>. The clip <b>180</b> then elastically or resiliently returns to its original position to receive and retain the leg <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> within the leg receiving portion <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The clip <b>180</b> also includes a retaining portion <b>190</b> that allows the clip to be connected to the table top <b>12</b>. The retaining portion <b>190</b> has a generally U-shaped configuration with opposing sidewalls <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> and a lower surface <b>196</b>. The opposing sidewalls <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> include outwardly extending projections <b>198</b>, <b>200</b>, respectively, that are sized and configured to securely connect the clip <b>180</b> to the table top <b>12</b>. In particular, the receiving portion <b>184</b> formed in the table top <b>12</b> includes an opening <b>202</b> that is desirably sized smaller than at least a portion of the width of the retaining portion <b>190</b> of the clip <b>180</b>. When the retaining portion <b>190</b> of the clip <b>180</b> is inserted into the opening <b>202</b>, the retaining portion and/or the opening deform or deflect to allow the retaining portion to be inserted into the receiving portion <b>184</b>. The opening <b>202</b> and/or the retaining portion <b>190</b> then resiliently or elastically return to there original positions to secure the clip <b>180</b> within the receiving portion <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Additionally, the receiving portion <b>184</b> includes opposing sidewalls <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and a bottom surface <b>208</b> and at least a portion of these surfaces are intended to contact corresponding portions of the clip <b>180</b>. Specifically, the sidewalls <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the receiving portion <b>184</b> are designed to contact the sidewalls <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> of the retaining portion <b>190</b> of the clip <b>180</b>, and the projections <b>198</b>, <b>200</b> are intended to bite into and engage the sidewalls of the receiving portion. The relatively large contact area between the retaining portion <b>190</b> of the clip <b>180</b> and the receiving portion <b>184</b> in the table top <b>10</b>, and the engagement of the projections <b>198</b>, <b>200</b> with the sidewalls <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the receiving portion, allows the clip to be securely connected to the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Advantageously, the clips <b>180</b> can be quickly and easily connected to the table top <b>12</b>, which may speed the manufacturing process. The clips <b>180</b> also allow the legs <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be secured in the collapsed position regardless of the position or orientation of the table 10. In addition, the clips <b>180</b> may be disconnected from the table top <b>12</b>, if desired. Significantly, the clips <b>180</b> can be attached to the table top <b>12</b> without the use of mechanical fasteners such as screws or bolts, but mechanical fasteners may be used to attach the clips to the table top if desired. Further, it will be appreciated that the clips <b>180</b> may have other suitable sizes and configurations depending, for example, upon the size and configuration of the receiving portion <b>184</b> formed in the table top <b>12</b>. Other suitable embodiments for the clip are disclosed in Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/409,259, filed Apr. 8, 2003 entitled Table with Frame That Can Be Attached to the Table Top without Mechanical Fasteners, which was previously incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Finally, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref> is an alternative embodiment of a table <b>412</b> wherein like elements are identified by like reference characters. Table <b>10</b> includes table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>. However, in contrast to having the hinge assemblies connected to the frame, table <b>10</b> comprises hinge assemblies <b>414</b> that are connected directly to table top sections <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> at a distance spaced apart from frame <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Although this invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by the claims which follow.</p>
