<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wire gripper having a gripping mechanism capable of gripping two wires at a desirable position thereof for suspending a heavy article without a rotation of the article around an axis of each wire is provided. The wire gripper (<b>1</b>) has an inner sleeve (<b>10</b>) and an outer sleeve (<b>40</b>). The inner sleeve (<b>10</b>) is formed with two wire-insertion bores (<b>11</b>) and two pairs of ball-set bores (<b>21</b>), each bore open at both the wire-insertion bores and an outer surface of the inner sleeve. And, the inner sleeve (<b>10</b>) has a tapered outer surface formed at a portion where the ball-set bores are formed. A spring <b>60</b> biases the inner sleeve (<b>10</b>) so that the tapered outer surface of the inner sleeve (<b>10</b>) contacts the tapered inner surface (<b>41</b><i>a</i>) of the outer sleeve (<b>40</b>). Large-diameter balls (<b>31</b>) and small-diameter balls (<b>31</b>) are received in the ball-set bores (<b>21</b>) and protrude partially into the wire-insertion bores (<b>11</b>) so as to press the wire with three balls in the four balls.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wire gripper capable of suspending an article at a desirable position of two wires. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wire gripper used for suspending a relatively heavy article without a rotation of the article around an axis of the wire, providing a neat appearance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a shop window of a clothing shop and the like, a mannequin with a dress is sometimes displayed hung from a ceiling by a wire. Since such a mannequin is relatively heavy, suspending the mannequin requires a stranded wire having a larger diameter (1.5 to 2.5 mm) than that of a wire used for suspending a relatively light-weight article such as a clothes hanger.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When one stranded wire suspends a relatively heavy article, the wire is twisted easily and therefore the suspended article rotates around the wire, resulting in a problem that the article cannot be displayed facing the front. This is mainly caused by the stranded wire. When a heavy article is suspended using one stranded wire, the stranded wire is twisted by its tension in the direction in which the stranded wire is loosened. Here, an angle of the twist is nearly proportional to the tension applied to the wire (i.e., the weight of the article to be suspended). Consequentially, in order to suspend an article using a stranded wire without a rotation of the article around an axis of the wire, generally, a weight for weight adjusting is hung from a lower end of the wire, or the article is suspended using two wires.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> show states in which mannequins are suspended by conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a state in which a weight D is hung from a lower end of a wire W to which a mannequin F is suspended. For example, the weight D has weight of 3 kg. By hanging the weight D, the stranded wire W is pulled downward and therefore stretched tight, whereby a torsion of the stranded wire W can be kept at a substantially constant state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows a state in which a mannequin P is suspended from a ceiling using two wires W. Two wire grippers <b>100</b> are mounted on a neck portion of the mannequin F. To each of the wire grippers <b>100</b>, each lower end of the two wires W is connected. Each upper end of the wires W is connected to a wire attachment <b>101</b>. The wire attachments <b>101</b> are coupled to parallel rails <b>103</b> which are mounted to the ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Using two wires W, the upper ends (the attachments <b>101</b>) and the lower ends (the grippers <b>100</b>) of the two wires W shape a plane surface. By shaping the plane surface, twisting of each stranded wire W is limited so that an article can be suspended without a rotation of the article around the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional method using a weight shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the weight D hung down under the mannequin P does not make a good showing. In addition, a load applied to the wire W, a wire attachment to which the wire is connected and the rail <b>103</b> to which the wire attachment is coupled becomes larger by just the weight of the weight D.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">And, the conventional method using two wires shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> also does not make a good showing. In addition, the method needs two wire grippers <b>100</b>, resulting in giving a clutter showing. Furthermore, in order to change a height of the suspending article, two wire grippers capable of gripping a wire at a desirable position are required. In this case, it is necessary that after one of the wire gripper is slid along the wire and held to a desirable position thereof, the other wire gripper is also slid along the wire and held to the same position, which is quite inconvenient.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a wire gripper having a gripping mechanism capable of gripping two wires at a desirable position thereof for suspending a heavy article without a rotation of the article around an axis of each wire.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A wire gripper according to the present invention comprises: an inner sleeve having the following components (A), (B) and (C); (A) two wire-insertion bores for inserting each of two wires, (B) two pairs of ball-set bores, each bore opened at both the wire-insertion bores and an outer surface of the inner sleeve, and (C) a tapered outer surface formed at a portion where the ball-set bores are formed; four balls received in the ball-set bores and protruding partially into the wire-insertion bores so as to press the wire, in which one group composed of three balls in the four balls presses one wire and the other group composed of three balls in the four balls presses the other wire; an outer sleeve having a tapered inner surface which contacts the tapered outer surface of the inner sleeve so as to press the balls inward; and a spring for biasing the inner sleeve relative to the outer sleeve in a direction in which the tapered outer surface is tapered down.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since a single wire gripper can grip two wires, it is not necessary to use two grippers for suspending an article as before. This makes a good appearance and facilitates the operations for mounting the gripper and changing the height of the suspending article. As described above, when an article is suspended using one stranded wire, an angle of twist of the stranded wire considerably changes in proportion to the weight of the article, resulting in problem in which the article cannot face to a desirable direction. However, using the wire gripper of this invention solves such problems. And, by mounting a wire gripper to each suspending position, a panel can be suspended without swinging in forward and backward directions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present invention, the four balls are preferably composed of one pair of two balls facing each other having a relatively large-diameter and the other pair of two balls facing each other having a relatively small-diameter, and a diameter ratio of the large-diameter ball to the small-diameter ball is about 3:2.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, each of two wires can be held at an approximately center of the wire-insertion bore with stable forces.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">And, in the wire gripper, a size of a wire to be gripped and an outer diameter of an outer sleeve are equal to those of a conventional wire gripper which gripes one wire, whereby the outer sleeve can be used for both the wire gripper according to the present invention and a conventional wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present invention, the inner sleeve preferably has a tip portion protruded from the outer sleeve in a direction in which the inner surface of the outer sleeve is tapered down, and the wire gripper further comprises; a wire guide cap mounted to the protruded tip portion of the inner sleeve, in which the wire guide cap having a wire-insertion bore formed with a tapered inner surface which is widened towards the tip end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present invention, the wire guide cap preferably serves as a mechanism for locking the wire to the wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">By mounting the wire guide cap to the tip portion of the inner sleeve, the wire can be locked in grip position, whereby it is prevented that the inner sleeve is carelessly pressed relative to the outer sleeve. And, when the upper or lower ends of the wires gripped to the wire gripper are each connected to one of the two separate attachments, the two wires extend from the wire gripper in leftward and rightward directions. In this case, the wires preferably should extend from the inner sleeve along desirable curvatures in order to facilitate various operations, such as releasing of the wires and view of the wires in both directions. In order to realize such condition, the wire guide cap, which has the tapered inner surface widened towards the tip end thereof, is mounted to the tip of the inner sleeve so that the extended wires can be guided smoothly in the extending directions along the tapered inner surface. And, the wires are bent smoothly so as to be prevented from being kept curved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An article suspension system for suspending an article by wires according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> connected the article, and two wires which are gripped to the wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present invention, a heavy article such as a mannequin and an article of weight variety can be suspended facing a desirable direction. And, a panel or a shelf can be suspended without swinging in backward and forward directions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An exhibit article suspension system for suspending an exhibit article for display by wires according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b>, in which the wire gripper is mounted to a part (a suspending portion) of the exhibit article, two wires which are gripped to the wire gripper at the lower ends thereof and extend upward from the wire gripper, and an attachment for connecting an upper end of each of the wires to a fixture such as a ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present invention, the exhibit article is preferably formed with two separate suspending portions and the wire gripper is mounted to each of the suspending portions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, swinging and rotating of the exhibit article can be decreased further.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A wire hanger according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b>, and a wire, one end thereof extending from one wire-insertion bore and inserting into the other wire-insertion bore of the wire gripper so as to form into a loop.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present invention, it becomes easy to change a length of the loop. Here, the &#x201c;hanger&#x201d; is used for placing an article using wires while giving tension to the article in addition to suspending an article using wires.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present invention, the outer sleeve is preferably formed with a shelf catch portion having a groove to which a shelf is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, when the wire gripper is used for a system for suspending a shelf, the shelf will be easily suspended.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A shelf suspension system for suspending a shelf horizontally by wires according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to claim <b>9</b> connected to a side edge of said shelf, and two wires gripped to the wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another shelf suspension system for suspending a shelf horizontally by wires according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> which is mounted to a fixture such as a ceiling, another wire gripper according to claim <b>9</b> which is mounted to each of separate positions (suspending positions) along a side edge of the shelf, still another wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> which is mounted to a fixture or a weight, and two wires gripped to each of the wire grippers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present invention, when a wire gripper has a hook formed on the outer sleeve, a hanger is easily suspended to the wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An article placing system for placing an exhibit article, an interior equipment or an exterior equipment (an article to be placed)) according to the present invention comprises: a wire gripper according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> which is mounted to a fixture such as a ceiling, and a wire of which the both ends are inserted into the wire-insertion bores of the wire gripper so as to make a loop for connecting the article to be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the present invention, since a length of the loop can be changed easily, a height of the suspending article and a tension applied to the article can be easily adjusted. Using a wire gripper for gripping one wire can also adjust a length of a wire, however, it is necessary to use two wire grippers or wire attachments in order to connect each end of the wire to a fixture or an article to be suspended. That is, two wire grippers or wire attachments are necessary. On the contrary, when a wire gripper capable of gripping two wires is used and the article to be suspended is formed with a wire-connecting portion, such as an opening through which a wire is passed, one wire gripper is necessary for suspending the article. In addition, a design diversity of the article to be suspended can be extended and the article can be displayed in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, a tension adjusting member, such as a spring and an elastic body, is preferably disposed between the wire gripper and the fixture or between the wire and the article to be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present invention, the spring makes it easy to adjust tension applied to the article to be placed. And, if slack or weak will occur in the article, remarkable decreasing of the tension applied to the article can be prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The wire gripper <b>1</b> is provided with an inner sleeve <b>10</b>, four balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) received in the inner sleeve <b>10</b>, an outer sleeve <b>40</b> having a hollow bore in which the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is received, and a spring <b>60</b> which biases the inner sleeve <b>10</b> relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> mainly, a structure of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> will be explained. The inner sleeve <b>10</b> is sometimes called by a pin.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The inner sleeve <b>10</b> is formed with two wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> each for inserting a wire (a diameter of 1.2 to 1.5 mm). The wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> penetrate the inner sleeve <b>10</b> in parallel to an axis (a longitudinal axis) of the inner sleeve <b>10</b>. Both wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> have a same inner diameter constant in the length direction (the longitudinal direction in figure). In this embodiment, the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> has a diameter of 1.8 mm, and a distance between the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> is about 2.5 mm (a distance from the axis of the inner sleeve to each of the wire-insertion bores is 1.25 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The inner sleeve <b>10</b> has, in the order from the top, a cylindrical upper portion <b>13</b>, a conical portion <b>15</b>, a cylindrical central portion <b>17</b> and a cylindrical lower portion <b>19</b>. The conical portion <b>15</b> has a tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>which is tapered down toward the upper from the lower. The cylindrical central portion <b>17</b> is continuously connected to a lower end of the conical portion <b>15</b>. And, the cylindrical lower portion <b>19</b> has an outer diameter smaller than that of the cylindrical central portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The inner sleeve <b>10</b> is formed with ball-set bores <b>21</b> between the conical portion <b>15</b> and the cylindrical central portion <b>17</b>, in which the ball-set bores <b>21</b> are open at both the outer surface of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>. Each of the ball-set bores <b>21</b> penetrate in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> (in a diametric direction) on a same level in the axis direction of the inner sleeve <b>10</b>. The ball-set bores <b>21</b> are composed of a pair of two large-diameter bores <b>21</b>L and a pair of two small-diameter bores <b>21</b>S, in which the bores of each pair face each other relative to the axis of the inner sleeve <b>10</b>. And, the small-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>S are open at the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> from a diametrical direction in which the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> are aligned. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one small-diameter ball-set bore <b>21</b>S-<b>1</b> is open at one wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and the other small-diameter ball-set bore <b>21</b>S-<b>2</b> is open at the other wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>2</b>. On the contrary, each of the large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>L-<b>2</b> is open at both the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> from a diametrical direction perpendicular to the direction in which the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> are aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other words, one wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> is open at one small-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>S-<b>1</b> and both large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>L-<b>2</b>, and another wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> is open at the other small-diameter ball-set bore <b>21</b>S-<b>2</b> and both large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>L-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this actual example, the pair of small-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>S and the pair of large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L penetrate the inner sleeve <b>10</b> in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> with being intersected at right angles each other. So, there is no wall separating the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> at a portion where the pair of small-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>S and the pair of the large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L penetrate the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and therefore the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> are communicated each other to form a hollow space.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, each of the large-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>L receives a large-diameter ball <b>31</b>, and each of the small-diameter ball-set bores <b>21</b>S receives a small-diameter ball <b>33</b>. Each bore has a diameter which is added &#x3b1; (for example, 0.1 mm) to a diameter of the ball received therein, whereby each of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> is rotatably and movably received in each ball-set bore <b>21</b> in an axis direction of the ball-set bore. Each of the ball-set bores <b>21</b> has a length slightly shorter than the diameter of each of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>. The diameter of each of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The outer sleeve <b>40</b>, having a substantially cylindrically shape, is formed with a hollow bore penetrating on an axis (a longitudinal axis) thereof. In the hollow bore, an upper portion <b>41</b> thereof is formed with a tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>tapered down toward the upper end thereof, and a lower portion <b>43</b> thereof is formed with an inner surface having a uniform inner diameter in the axis of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the inner diameter of the lower portion <b>43</b> is 9.2 mm. The lower portion <b>43</b> is formed with a thread <b>45</b> at an almost lower half of the inner surface. A spring retainer <b>49</b> is inserted through an opening of the lower portion <b>43</b> and engaged with the thread <b>45</b>. The spring retainer <b>49</b> is formed with a bore <b>51</b> at the center thereof, through which the lower portion <b>19</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is passed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The spring <b>60</b> is fitted onto the lower portion <b>19</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and placed between an under surface of the center portion <b>17</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and the spring retainer <b>49</b>. The spring <b>60</b> biases the inner sleeve <b>10</b> relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b> (the spring retainer <b>49</b>) upward so that the tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. At the same time, the balls received in each of the ball-set bores <b>21</b> formed at the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contact the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> at the outside surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is pressed downward (toward the spring retainer <b>49</b>) against the biasing force of the spring <b>60</b>, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is received into the outer sleeve <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is received into the outer sleeve <b>40</b>, the upper portion <b>13</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is protruded from the upper opening of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. And, the tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the conical portion <b>15</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>41</b> of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. The lower portion <b>19</b> of the outer sleeve <b>10</b> is passed though the bore <b>51</b> of the spring retainer <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a gripping operation of the wire gripper <b>1</b> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a state in which the tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is represented by a solid line, and another state in which the tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> keeps apart from the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is represented by a chained double-dashed line.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the spring <b>60</b> biases the inner sleeve <b>10</b> upward relative to the spring retainer <b>49</b> and therefore the tapered inner surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered outer surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>, as represented by a chained double-dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> received into each ball-set bore <b>21</b> are pressed by the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> and protrude into the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> at the inside surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the wire W will be inserted into the wire gripper <b>1</b>, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is pressed toward the spring retainer <b>49</b> against the biasing force of the spring <b>60</b>. The inner sleeve <b>10</b> moves in a direction in which the inner diameter of the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is widened, resulting in producing a clearance between the outer surface of the center portion <b>17</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. Therefore, each of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> received into each ball-set bore <b>21</b>, formed at the center portion <b>17</b>, can move toward the clearance outward, as shown in arrows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At such the state, the wires W are inserted into the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>. When the lead ends of the wires W are reached to the ball-set bores <b>21</b> in the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>, the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, movable outward, are pressed outward by outside surfaces of the wires W. This results in opening the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> and therefore allowing inserting the wires W through the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After sliding the wire gripper <b>1</b> along the wire W for a desirable length, a force in which the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is pressed toward the spring retainer <b>49</b> is released. And, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is biased by the spring <b>60</b> so as to be moved in a direction in which the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is tapered down (upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). As a result, the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are pressed by the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>inward and protrude into the wire-insertion bores. Then, each of the wires W is pressed with the two large-diameter balls <b>31</b>L and one small-diameter ball <b>31</b>S so as to be gripped.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, a diameter of each ball, a positional relation between each ball and the wire-insertion bores and a gripping force using the balls will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a diameter of each ball will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method for geometrically obtaining the diameter of the ball.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a state in which the large-diameter balls <b>31</b> contact each other and also each of the small-diameter balls <b>33</b> contacts both large-diameter balls <b>31</b> while each of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> being inscribed in a circle C<b>1</b>. In such a case, a line passing a center of each large-diameter ball <b>31</b> is perpendicular to a line passing a center of each small-diameter ball <b>33</b>. Therefore, in a triangle connecting a contact point P<b>1</b> between the large-diameter balls <b>31</b>, a center point P<b>2</b> of the large-diameter ball <b>31</b> and a center point P<b>3</b> of the small-diameter ball <b>33</b>, when the diameter of the large-diameter ball <b>31</b> is set to &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the diameter of the small-diameter ball <b>33</b> is set to &#x201c;ax&#x201d;, x=&#x2154;. This shows that a diameter ratio of the large-diameter ball <b>31</b> to the small-diameter ball <b>33</b> is 3:2. And, the diameter &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the large-diameter ball <b>33</b> is &#xbd; of a radius of the circle C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows not a state in which the wires W are actually gripped but a state in which each ball is moved innermost.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this embodiment, when a diameter of the circle C<b>1</b> is set to 8 mm, each diameter of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> can be obtained in the same manner described above. The obtained diameter of the large-diameter ball <b>31</b> is about 4 mm and the obtained diameter of the small-diameter ball <b>33</b> is about 2.6 mm. The practically used large-diameter ball <b>31</b> has a diameter of 4 mm and the practically used small-diameter ball <b>33</b> has a diameter of 2.5 mm. The reason that the diameter of the small-diameter ball <b>33</b> practically used is smaller than the geometrically obtained diameter by about 0.1 mm is that the ball having a diameter of 2.5 mm is easily-obtainable in the market.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, a state in which a wire is gripped by the balls each having the obtained diameter will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, the wire W is pressed by two large-diameter balls <b>31</b> and one small-diameter ball <b>33</b> so as to be gripped. In such a case, the wire W is preferably pressed with substantially equal forces from substantial equally dispersed directions around the axis of the wire W at the center of the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>. For this purpose, it is preferable to position the center of each the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> at a center of a circle C<b>2</b> circumscribed by three balls (one large-diameter ball <b>31</b> and two small-diameter balls <b>33</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The diameter of the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> is the diameter (1.2 to 1.5 mm) of the wire W to add &#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown by a solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when the tapered inner surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered outer surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>, the wire W is gripped by the protruded portions of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> which are pressed by the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a. </i>In which case, the wire is elastically deformed at portions pressed by the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>. Each of such deformed portions (represented by a hatching in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an area in which each ball is protruded into the wire-insertion bore, an exposed thread) is set such that the strands of the wire W do not loosen and cut off.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By setting each diameter of the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> and the position of the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> in the manner described above, it becomes possible that the balls are protruded into the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> from substantial equally dispersed directions around the axis of the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> with substantial same amounts when each ball moves inward in each ball-set bore (in a direction in which the wire W is gripped).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">This fact will be explained referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> more in detail. Since one wire-insertion bore <b>11</b> is communicated with two large-diameter bores <b>21</b>L and one small-diameter bore <b>21</b>S as described above, one wire W is pressed by two large-diameter balls <b>31</b> and one small-diameter ball <b>33</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the wire W, inserted through one wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>, is pressed by two large-diameter balls <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> and one small-diameter ball <b>33</b>-<b>1</b>. In plane, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, three balls <b>31</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> protrude into the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> at substantial equally dispersed angles around the center of the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> with substantial equal amounts (represented by the hatching in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Accordingly, since the wire, inserted into the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>, is pressed from substantially equal dispersed directions around the axis of the wire with substantially equal forces, the wire can be gripped substantially at the center of the wire-insertion bore <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In order to release the gripping force, a user pinches the inner sleeve <b>10</b> by fingers of one-hand while pinching the outer sleeve <b>40</b> by fingers of another hand. Then, on pressing the inner sleeve <b>10</b> relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b> toward the spring retainer <b>49</b> against the biasing force of the spring <b>60</b>, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is moved in a direction in which the inner diameter of the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is larger, as represented by a chained double-dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As a result, a clearance is produced between the outer surface of the center portion <b>17</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> and the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. And, the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, received into the ball-set bores <b>21</b> formed at the center portion <b>17</b>, move outward toward the clearance as shown in arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> move outward in the ball-set bores <b>21</b> and therefore are separated from the wire W, the force by which each wire is gripped disappears or becomes weak. Then, the wires W can freely slide upward and downward through the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>. And, since the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are rotatably received in the ball-set bores <b>21</b>, friction between the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> and the wires W at sliding is so small that the wires W can slide smoothly through the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">After sliding the gripper <b>1</b> along the wires W for a desired length, the force pressing the inner sleeve <b>10</b> toward the spring retainer <b>49</b> is released. This causes the inner sleeve <b>10</b> to be biased by the spring <b>60</b>, whereby the tapered outer surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> contacts the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. As a result, the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are pressed by the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>so as to grip the wires W.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a state in which a mannequin is suspended by the wire gripper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A hollow male thread <b>111</b> is fitted on a neck portion of a mannequin F, protruding from the neck portion. The wire gripper <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is mounted to the mannequin F by engaging the thread <b>45</b> formed on the lower portion <b>43</b> of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> thereof with the male thread <b>111</b> of the mannequin F. To the wire gripper <b>1</b>, two wires W are inserted and gripped. The wires W extend downward inside the mannequin F from the wire gripper <b>1</b> and also extend upward in rightward and leftward directions. And, upper ends of the wires W are each connected to one of two attachments <b>101</b> which are slidably coupled to a rail <b>103</b> mounted on a ceiling. Each upper end (the attachments <b>101</b>) of the wires W and each lower end (the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> of the wire gripper <b>1</b>) thereof shape a quadrangular plane surface. By shaping a plane surface, the mannequin F can be suspended without a rotation of the mannequin around the axis of the wire W. In this case, although a distance between the lower ends of the wires is small as the distance between the wire-insertion bores <b>11</b> of the wire gripper <b>1</b>, an effect for suppressing twisting of the stranded wire is demonstrated sufficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the mannequin F is suspended by the wire gripper <b>1</b>, the outer sleeve <b>40</b> which is engaged with the female thread <b>111</b> of the mannequin F is pulled downward by the weight of the mannequin F. Then, the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> is moved in the direction in which the tapered inner surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is widened, resulting in increasing the force in which the tapered inner surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> presses the balls <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> inward. Accordingly, suspending an article to the wire gripper <b>1</b> increases the gripping force.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When two wires are necessary for suspending a heavy article or for preventing a wire from rotating around its axis, using one wire gripper <b>1</b> allows suspending the article by two wires. This provides a good appearance compared with the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, in which two wire grippers are used. And, one operation (pressing the inner sleeve <b>10</b> relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b>) allows the wire gripper <b>1</b> to be slid along the wires W at the same time so that a position of the suspending article can be easily changed along the wires W.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, using a wire gripper having a wire guide cap, described below referred to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, improves operationality and desinability.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another example of use of the wire gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">This example shows that a panel P is suspended by using the wire gripper <b>1</b>. A male thread (not shown) is fitted around each upper corner of the panel P, and the female thread <b>45</b>, formed at the outer sleeve <b>40</b> of the wire gripper <b>1</b>, is engaged with the male thread. One of the two wires W, which are gripped to the wire gripper <b>1</b>, extends directly upward and is connected to one wire attachment <b>105</b>; the other wire W extend diagonally upward and is connected to the other wire attachment <b>105</b>. In this case, for the wire attachment <b>105</b>, the wire gripper <b>1</b> may be used. By suspending the panel P in such the manner, the panel P can be suspended without swinging in rightward and leftward directions in figure. For example, when a panel is suspended by using two wires, the panel swings in rightward and leftward directions easily. On the contrary, in this example, swinging of the panel P in rightward and leftward directions is suppressed by the diagonal wires W so that the panel P hardly swings in rightward and leftward directions. In addition, by using the wire gripper <b>1</b>, single wire grip is required for gripping the ends of two wires W. And, it becomes easy to change a position of the suspending panel P.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A wire gripper <b>200</b> is provided with a wire guide cap <b>201</b> which is engaged with the wire gripper <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the upper portion <b>13</b> of the inner sleeve <b>10</b> protrudes from the upper opening of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> by biasing upward by the spring <b>60</b>. The protruded upper portion <b>13</b> is formed with an outer thread <b>13</b><i>a </i>on an outer surface thereof. The wire guide cap <b>201</b> is engaged with the outer thread <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The wire guide cap <b>201</b> has a wire-insertion bore <b>203</b> penetrating in an axis direction of the wire gripper <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. The wire-insertion bore <b>203</b> is formed with an inner thread <b>203</b><i>a </i>at the almost lower half inner surface thereof. With the inner thread <b>203</b><i>a</i>, the outer thread <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>13</b> of the inner sleeve is engaged. And, the wire-insertion bore <b>203</b> is formed with a tapered inner surface <b>205</b> which is widened toward the upper end thereof (in the opposite direction to the wire gripper) from the inner thread <b>203</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When the inner thread <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the wire guide cap <b>201</b> is fully engaged with the outer thread <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the inner sleeve <b>10</b>, no clearance exists between the wire guide cap <b>201</b> and the outer sleeve <b>40</b>, and therefore it becomes impossible for the inner sleeve <b>10</b> to be pressed downward relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b>. Thus, engaging the wire guide cap <b>201</b> allows the wire gripper <b>200</b> to be locked keeping to be gripped. Accordingly, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> is prevented from being pressed carelessly and therefore from releasing the gripping force.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">When the gripping force should be released, the cap <b>201</b> is moved upward by loosing the inner thread <b>203</b><i>a </i>relative to the outer thread <b>13</b><i>a </i>so as to produce a clearance between the cap <b>200</b> and the outer sleeve <b>40</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>). As a result, the inner sleeve <b>10</b> can be pressed downward relative to the outer sleeve <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The outer surface of the cap <b>201</b> has a knurled surface <b>207</b> for easy handling of the cap <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in many cases in which the wire gripper <b>200</b> is used, two wires extend upward (or downward) from the wire gripper <b>200</b> in the rightward and leftward directions (or the backward and forward directions). So, in order to guide the wires W in each extending direction, the wire guide cap <b>201</b> is provided with the tapered inner surface <b>205</b>, which is widened towards the upper end. Accordingly, by providing the inner sleeve with a portion which guides the wires W so as to extend along the actual extending curvatures, a wire grip releasing operation and a wire sliding operation can be smoothly performed. In addition, the wire bends smoothly, thereby to prevent the wire from being kept curved.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Next, examples of use of the wire gripper <b>200</b> will be explained. The wire gripper <b>200</b> is used in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and also in the modification embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a canvas spreading system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> show a part (a corner of the canvas) of the canvas placing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and modification examples thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">This example shows a system for spreading a square canvas C (including a cloth, a mesh, a resin sheet and the like) between a ceiling and a floor by using the wire gripper <b>200</b>. By adjusting a tension of the canvas C and changing the kind of the canvas C, the canvas C can be used for various applications such as a screen, a partition and an ornamental article.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Two rails <b>501</b> are mounted on the ceiling and the floor in parallel. To each rail <b>501</b>, two wire attachments <b>503</b> are slidably and fixably connected. The square canvas C is formed with an eyelet <b>507</b> at each corner thereof. The diagonally positioned eyelets <b>507</b> are pulled in the opposite directions by two wire gripper assemblies <b>220</b> each connected to the attachment <b>503</b>, resulting in that the canvas C can be spread between the ceiling rail <b>501</b> and the floor rail <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> comprises a wire gripper <b>200</b> (a wire gripper in which the wire gripper <b>1</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is exchanged for the wire gripper <b>200</b>), to which both ends of a loop wire W are gripped, and a spring <b>221</b> series-connected to the wire gripper <b>200</b>. The spring <b>221</b> is formed with hooks <b>223</b> and <b>225</b> at the both ends thereof. One hook <b>223</b> is fixedly connected to the end of the outer sleeve <b>40</b> of the wire gripper <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Both end of the wire W are gripped to the wire gripper <b>200</b> after the wire W is passed through the eyelet <b>507</b> of the canvas C. Thus, the canvas C (the eyelet <b>507</b>) is coupled to the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b>. And, the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> is coupled to the rails <b>501</b> by hooking the other hook <b>225</b> of the spring <b>221</b> of the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> to the attachment <b>503</b> coupled to the rail <b>501</b>. As a result, the four corners of the canvas C are diagonally pulled and connected to the attachments <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this example, although the canvas C is spread while giving tension adjustable by the spring <b>221</b>, in order to adjust the tension of the canvas C more widely, it is necessary to change a length of the wire W (a distance between the wire gripper <b>200</b> and the eyelet <b>507</b>). In such a case, using the wire gripper <b>200</b> capable of gripping two wires at desirable positions thereof makes it easy to adjust the length of the wire. In addition, since one wire gripper is used per one eyelet <b>507</b>, a simple and good appearance can be given.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In this example, the canvas C is formed with the eyelet <b>507</b> at each corner thereof, however, it is also possible that a hook is attached at each corner or that each corner of a canvas is turned thereon so as to form a doubled canvas portion for connecting the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">And, a coupling portion between the canvas and a fixture can be changed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. In these examples, the canvas is not connected to the rail but directly coupled to the ceiling or the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the eyelet <b>507</b> formed on the canvas C is connected to the floor via a wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>. The wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> comprises the wire gripper <b>200</b> and a fixed part <b>231</b> which is fixedly mounted to the floor. The wire gripper <b>200</b> is rotatable relative to the fixed part <b>231</b>. In addition, the wire gripper <b>200</b> contains a screw-type tension-adjusting member inside. The screw-type tension-adjusting member can adjust tension of the wire by rotating the wire gripper <b>200</b> relative to the fixed part <b>231</b>. The tension-adjusting member has the same action as that of the spring <b>221</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is connected to a hook <b>509</b> fixedly mounted on the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In addition, it is possible that a spring is connected between the wire and an article to be spread (the canvas).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">By using the spring, tension of an article to be spread (the canvas) can be adjusted easily. Alternatively, even if slack or weak will occur, the article can be stably spread without remarkable decreasing of the tension.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">This example shows a system for spreading a canvas C in substantially the same manner as the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> except that the canvas C is connected to the ceiling and the floor at each middle portion of the upper and lower edges in addition to the four corners.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The canvas C is formed with an eyelet at each middle portion of the upper and lower edges in addition to the four corners thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The upper edge of the canvas C is connected to attachments, fixedly mounted on the ceiling, by using a wire gripper assembly <b>240</b>. The wire gripper assembly <b>240</b> comprises a wire gripper capable of gripping one wire and a spring. A hook of the spring is hooked on the eyelet <b>507</b> formed at the upper edge of the canvas C. To the attachment <b>511</b> to which each upper corner of the canvas C is coupled, one end of a wire W is fixedly connected previously. The other end of the wire W is gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>240</b>. On the other hand, the attachment <b>513</b>, to which the upper middle edge of the canvas C is coupled, comprises a wire gripper capable of gripping one wire W and a fixed part which is fixedly mounted on a fixture such as a ceiling. Both end of the wire W is gripped to the attachment <b>513</b> and the wire gripper assembly <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The lower corners and the lower middle edge of the canvas C is connected to the floor by using the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> (having a spring) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> and the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (having a fixed part) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. A wire W of the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> is passed through the eyelet <b>507</b> formed at the lower left corner of the canvas C. The spring of the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> is hooked on a hook <b>509</b> fixedly mounted on the floor. And, a wire W of the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>, fixedly mounted on the floor, is passed through the eyelet <b>507</b> formed at the lower middle edge of the canvas C. And, a wire W of the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>, fixedly mounted on a weight <b>517</b> placed on the floor, is passed through the eyelet <b>507</b> formed at the lower left corner of the canvas C.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a canvas placing system according another embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In this example, the canvas C is formed with wire-connecting portions <b>508</b> in exchange for the eyelets. The wire-connecting portion <b>508</b> is made such that the canvas is turned thereon so as to form a doubled canvas portion. A wire gripper <b>250</b> capable of gripping one wire W is fixedly connected to each upper corner and the upper middle edge of the canvas C. And, the wire grippers <b>250</b> are connected to attachments <b>511</b> and <b>513</b>, which are fixedly mounted on the ceiling, via wires W. On the other hand, the lower edge of the canvas C is coupled to the floor in the same manner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> except that the wire is passed through the wire-connecting portion <b>508</b> of the canvas C.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In addition, a cord <b>520</b> is set by sewing along each edge of the canvas C. The cord <b>520</b> includes an elastic and flexible urethane cord or a wire. The cord enables keeping each edge of the canvas C with giving tension thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, even when the wire gripper capable of gripping one wire is used, a length of the wire can be adjusted, however, in which case, an attachment or a wire gripper for holding or gripping each of the upper and lower end of a wire is required. For example, when the upper edge of the canvas is connected to the ceiling in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the attachment <b>511</b>, to which one end of the wire W is fixedly connected, and the wire gripper assembly <b>240</b>, to which the canvas is connected, are required. On the contrary, when the lower edge of the canvas is connected to the floor in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, one wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> or <b>230</b> capable of gripping both ends of a wire is used. That is, one connecting portion requires only one wire gripper assembly. Accordingly, by using such wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> or <b>230</b>, the following operations; a canvas is formed with a connecting portion through which a wire is passed; and, such wire gripper assembly is connected to a fixture; are necessary for adjusting the length of the wire. In addition, a design diversity of the canvas C can be extended.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a partition system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">This example shows a system for dividing a plane by crossing plural strands between opposite surfaces such as a ceiling and a floor so as to construct a plane composed of the strands. The strand includes a wire with urethane coating, for example. In this case, the urethane coating of the strand is stripped at the both ends so as to expose the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">A pair of L-form bars <b>531</b> are fixedly mounted on a ceiling and a floor in parallel each other.

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The hook of the spring of the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> is hooked on the opening <b>533</b> of the bar <b>531</b>. And, the wire gripper of the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> grips one or two strands <b>540</b>. In the left part in the figure, an end of each of the two strands <b>540</b> is gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b> coupled to one bar <b>531</b>. The two strands extend toward the other bar <b>531</b> in rightward and leftward directions in figure from the wire gripper assembly <b>220</b>. And, the other end of each of the two strands is gripped to the adjacent wire gripper assemblies <b>240</b>, respectively, which are connected to the bar <b>531</b> next to each other. As a result, the strands <b>240</b> are crossed between the bars <b>531</b> with being intersected each other in the intermediate space between the bars <b>531</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the middle part in the figure, the strand is crossed between the adjacent wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b> connected to the bar <b>531</b>.

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">And, in the right part in the figure, the wire gripper assemblies <b>220</b> are alternately connected to the openings <b>533</b> of the bar <b>531</b>. The strand <b>540</b> is gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>, connected to one bar <b>531</b>, at the one end thereof and extends toward the other bar <b>531</b>. Then, after the strand <b>540</b> passes through the opening <b>553</b> of the bar <b>531</b>, the strand <b>540</b> is turned back toward the former bar <b>531</b> and gripped to another wire gripper assembly <b>220</b>, which is positioned next to the former wire gripper assembly <b>220</b>. As shown in this example, there is no necessity of connecting the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> in all openings <b>533</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The partition system in this example is used for a partition separating two spaces or an ornamental article installed in front of a wall surface. Various decoration effects can be expected by changing a color of the strand <b>540</b> (the urethane coating). And, by using the wire gripper capable of gripping two wires, both ends of the strand are terminated with a good appearance. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, it is possible to cross the strand in various forms.</p>

And, two wires W of the attachments <b>565</b> are gripped to the wire gripper <b>200</b> at the upper ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In order to suspend the wide lighting apparatus safely, like this example, it is preferable to suspend the apparatus using plural wires at plural positions (in this example, four positions). Conventionally, such the case requires plural wire grippers or attachments for gripping or holding each upper end of the plural wires. On the contrary, by using the wire gripper <b>200</b> in this embodiment, the upper ends of the two wires can be gripped to the one wire gripper <b>200</b>. Therefore, the number of the wire gripper or the attachment to be used can decrease. And, as shown in this figure, the lighting apparatus <b>553</b> can be suspended from the linear rail <b>561</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a shelf suspending system according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">This example shows a system for suspending two shelves horizontally on a wall surface using the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>. Two pairs of the wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b>, in which one pair of the wire gripper assemblies is composed of two wire gripper assemblies longitudinally separately arranged, are laterally separately mounted on a wall surface. The wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> comprises the wire gripper and the fixed part <b>231</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. The fixed part <b>231</b> is fixedly mounted on the wall surface. Since the wire gripper <b>200</b> is rotated relative to the fixed part <b>231</b>, the upper wire gripper <b>200</b> faces downward and the lower wire gripper <b>200</b> faces upward. Between the wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b>, the shelves S are held horizontally by wires.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">A wire gripper <b>571</b>, having a shelf catch as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is mounted around each end of each opposite side (the shorter side in this example) of the shelf S. In this example, the shelf S is held to the shelf catch by not inserting the shelf into the groove but tightening a screw. And, the wire gripper <b>571</b> can grip not two wires but one wire.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The ends of the wires W are gripped to the upper and lower wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b>, respectively. Each length of the two wires is different. And, the intermediate portion of the shorter wire WS is gripped to the wall-side wire gripper <b>571</b>R, while the intermediate portion of the longer wire WL is gripped to the front-side wire gripper <b>571</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In this example, the upper and lower ends of the wires are gripped to one wire gripper, respectively, resulting in treating the ends of the wires W with a good appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In addition, in this example, it is also possible that a shelf is suspended vertically on the wall surface. In such a case, at each opposed side of the shelf, a wire gripper <b>573</b> and a wire guide <b>575</b> are attached.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a shelf suspending system according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">This example shows a system for suspending a shelf S from a ceiling horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">First, a shelf suspending system, shown in the center part of the figure, will be explained. In this case, two shelves S are suspended with being longitudinally separated.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">On the ceiling, an attachment <b>581</b>, to which ends of two wires are fixedly connected, is mounted. And, a wire gripper <b>583</b> capable of gripping one wire is fixedly mounted through each corner of the shelves S. Two wires W of the attachment <b>581</b> extend downward in forward and backward directions in the figure and the intermediate portion of each wire W is gripped to the wire gripper <b>583</b>, which is mounted at the shorter side of the shelf S. And, the lower ends of the wires W are gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) mounted to a weight <b>585</b> placed on a floor. In addition, it is also possible that the lower wire gripper <b>230</b> is directly fixed to the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Using the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> having the wire gripper capable of gripping two wires makes it possible that the weight <b>585</b> is placed just under the center of the shelf S. For example, when a wire gripper capable of gripping one wire is used in a conventional way, it is necessary to place a weight just under the four corners of the shelf. So, the number of components necessary for the suspension system increases. And, a problem in which someone might stub his toe against the wire or the weight is raised. On the contrary, since using the wire gripper capable of gripping two wires makes it possible that the weight <b>585</b> is placed just under the center of the shelf, such problem is erased.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Next, a shelf suspending system, shown in the right part in the figure, will be explained. In this example, two shelves S are suspended with being longitudinally separated.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">On the ceiling, a wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) is fixedly mounted. And, a wire gripper <b>200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is fixedly mounted through each corner of the shelves S.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">From the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b>, two wires extend downward in backward and forward directions. Each of the intermediate portions of the wires W is gripped to the wire gripper <b>200</b>T, which is mounted at the shorter side of the upper shelf S. Then, the two wires extend downward in backward and forward directions. And, each of the intermediate portions of the wires W is gripped to the wire gripper <b>200</b>B, which is mounted at the shorter side of the lower shelf S. The lower ends of the two wires W are gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) mounted on a weight <b>585</b> placed on the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">This example can decrease swinging of the shelves S in forward and backward directions compared with the example shown at the center part of the figure. Because, as described in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, swinging of the shelf in forward and backward directions can be prevented by the diagonal wires. And, by using the wire gripper capable of gripping two wires, the ends of the wires and the mounting portion of the wire to the shelf can be treated with a good appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a shelf suspending system according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">This example also shows a system for suspending shelves horizontally from a ceiling. In this example, two shelves S can be suspended side by side in horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">On a ceiling, an attachment <b>581</b>, to which upper ends of two wires are fixedly connected, are mounted. A wire gripper <b>1</b>&#x2032;, having a shelf catch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is fixedly mounted around each end of each opposite side (the shorter side in this example) of the shelf S. And, two shelves S are connected horizontally by using a wire gripper <b>600</b> having two shelf catches facing in opposite directions. In each shelf catch, the shelves SL and SR are held respectively. The shelf catch may be the groove type or the screw type.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The two wires of the attachment <b>581</b> mounted on the ceiling extend downward in backward and forward directions. And, the intermediate portions of the wires W are gripped to the wire gripper <b>1</b>&#x2032; or the wire gripper <b>600</b>, which are mounted at the shorter side of the upper shelf S. Then, the two wires extend downward in backward and forward directions. And, the intermediate portions of the wires W are gripped to the wire gripper <b>1</b>&#x2032; or the wire gripper <b>600</b>, which are mounted at the shorter side of the lower shelf S. And, the lower ends of the two wires W are gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>), which are arranged in a direction, in which the shelves SR and SL are coupled, and fixed on the floor. In addition, each of the two wires extends from the lower shelf S in rightward and leftward directions in the figure and is gripped to the adjacent wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b> arranged in the aforesaid direction (the rightward and leftward directions in figure).</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In this example, the shelves S can be suspended without swinging in forward and backward directions in the figure. At the same time, since the wire gripper assemblies <b>230</b>, mounted on the floor, are arranged in a direction in which the shelves SR and SL are coupled, it also becomes possible that the shelves S are suspended without swinging in rightward and leftward directions.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a bar suspending system according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">This example shows a system for suspending a bar <b>610</b>, to which hangers and the like are hung, from a ceiling. In this example, each end of the bar <b>610</b> is suspended using two wires hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">On the ceiling, an attachment <b>613</b>, to which upper end of a wire W is fixedly connected, are separately mounted arranged in a direction perpendicular to a length direction of the bar <b>610</b>. And, the wire gripper <b>200</b> capable of gripping two wires, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is fixedly mounted through at each end portion of the bar <b>610</b>. The wires W, extending downward from the attachment <b>613</b>, are gripped to the wire gripper <b>200</b> at the intermediate portions thereof and then extend downward in parallel. And, the lower ends of the wires W are gripped to the wire gripper assembly <b>230</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) mounted to a weight <b>615</b> placed on a floor.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> show a key ring type wire gripper according to the present invention: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> are front views thereof; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> are side views thereof; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24D</figref> are front cross sectional views thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">This example shows a key ring using the wire gripper <b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, providing with a wire guide cap, having substantially the same structure as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The wire gripper grips both ends of a wire W which is bent into a loop.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In the key ring <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the gripper <b>1</b> is column-shaped. And, the cap <b>701</b> is also column-shaped without the tapered inner surface. In addition, a rotating case <b>703</b> is rotatably mounted to the spring retainer <b>49</b>, which is engaged with the lower hollow portion of the outer sleeve <b>40</b>, by a truss screw <b>705</b>. The rotating case <b>703</b> is formed with a penetrating bore <b>707</b> in a direction perpendicular to an axis direction of the wire-insertion bore of the gripper.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The key ring <b>800</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, including a cap <b>801</b> and a spring retainer <b>803</b>, is oval-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">When a key is held to the wire W, the cap <b>701</b> or <b>801</b> is rotated with the wire gripper <b>1</b> so that a clearance is produced between the cap <b>701</b> or <b>801</b> and the outer sleeve, resulting in releasing a wire from the gripper.</p>
