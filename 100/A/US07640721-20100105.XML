<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A tractor comprises a tractor frame, driven ground engaging device, and an electronic tractor controller. A baler comprises a baler frame coupled or connected to the tractor frame, a crop receiving device, a baling chamber, a bale size sensor associated with the baling chamber, and an electronic baler controller. The baler controller is operable to submit a halt signal to the tractor controller when a bale size signal provided by the bale size sensor indicates that a bale has reached a size equal to or exceeding a first predetermined size. The tractor controller is operable to command the ground engaging means to automatically halt the tractor when receiving a halt signal from the baler controller. A steering controller is connected to a swath position sensor and operable to automatically steer the tractor along a swath based upon the signals of the crop swath sensor and of the bale shape sensor such that a uniform bale shape is obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a division of applicant's application U.S. Ser. No. 11/344,447, filed 31 Jan. 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,404,355 and titled TRACTOR AND BALER COMBINATION WITH AUTOMATIC BALING AND STEERING CONTROL.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tractor/baler combination.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A tractor/baler combination is used in agriculture to take up crop lying or standing on a field and to press and bind it to a bale. An operator sits at an operator station of the tractor and steers the tractor along the crop. Usually, a baler monitor or a reconfigurable display connected to a bus system is located within the field of view of the operator. The operator has to look at the monitor or display at regular intervals, since it displays information on the actual state of the baler.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, the operator also has to obey a number of actions displayed to him or her on the display or monitor, although a number of baler functions have been automated recently, like opening and closing rear doors of the baler to allow a bale to eject. One of these actions is to stop the driving motion of the tractor once a bale is ready to be bound with twine or wrapped with net or sheet material, in order to stop additional crop from entering the baling chamber that would disturb the binding or wrapping action.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Automatic systems have been proposed for controlling the propelling speed of the tractor in a manner such that a desired crop throughput is obtained. They still rely on the operator to stop the tractor once a bale is to be bound or wrapped.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another duty of the operator is to steer the tractor along the swath. Automatic steering systems recognizing the swath using a video camera and an image processing system or a scanning laser sensor detecting the contour of the swath have been proposed, but they attempt to drive along the center of the swath. This leads to a barrel shaped bale with less crop material at the edges than at its center due to the shape of the swath. Sensors for the shape of the bale have been proposed that give steering information to the operator, but they still rely on a manual steering operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The described duties are fatiguing for an operator who has driven and controlled the tractor/baler combination for a longer time. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a tractor/baler combination with additional automatic functions that make work for the operator less fatiguing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, a combination of a tractor and a baler connected or coupled to or integrated into the tractor (as a self propelled baler) is provided. The tractor comprises a frame and ground engaging means supporting the frame upon the ground. The ground engaging means can be wheels or belts and are connected directly or via a drive train to an engine or motor, such that they can be driven to propel the tractor at least in a forward direction over a field. An electronic tractor controller is arranged to command the propelling speed of the tractor. The (round or rectangular) baler comprises a frame, a baling chamber mounted on the frame and a crop receiving means for collecting or receiving crop lying or standing upon a field and conveying the crop into the baling chamber. A bale size sensor detecting the size of the bale baled in the baling chamber is connected to an electronic baler controller. The baler controller can be provided on the baler or on the tractor. When the bale size sensor detects that the size of the bale reaches or exceeds a first predetermined size, thus indicating that it is at the time to tie twine around the bale or to wrap it with net or foil, and hence no additional crop material should be introduced into the baling chamber, the baler controller sends a halt signal to the tractor controller. The tractor controller then commands the ground engaging means to halt, without an operator interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this manner, work of the operator is made easier since he does not need to observe a monitor or display indicating him to stop the tractor. Production of bales that are larger than desired is thus avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The tractor is preferably decelerated or brought to a speed lower than during baling, as soon as the bale reaches or exceeds a second size that is somewhat smaller than the first size. Due to the deceleration, an abrupt stopping or braking is avoided when the bale reaches the first size.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment, the baler is a round baler and comprises a wrapping material dispenser that ejects or dispenses a twine, net or sheet to the bale upon a command of the baler controller. This command is given once the bale size sensor submits a signal indicating that the bale size exceeds the first size. The ground engaging means are only halted once a wrapping material movement sensor indicates that the wrapping material is caught and hence pulled by the bale. The invention could however also be used on a rectangular baler in order to stop the tractor when the bale is bound with a tine or wrapped with a net or sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The tractor controller can control the ground engaging means to propel the tractor automatically with a speed yielding a desired baler throughput. The throughput can be measured by detecting the torque at a PTO (power take off) of the tractor driving the baler or with a sensor detecting the thickness of a crop layer received by the baler or with a sensor measuring the torque for driving the crop receiving means. After a bale has been ejected, it is proposed to await a resume baling operation signal that is to be input by an operator into a user interface connected to the tractor controller, before the ground engaging means of the tractor are set into motion again. This operator input has security advantages, since the operator can check whether the baler and tractor combination is in a condition appropriate to build a new bale before the operation resumes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is further proposed that the baler has a door for ejecting the bale. An actuator of the door is only activated and the bale is only ejected after the operator has input a bale ejection signal to a user interface. One thus avoids that a bale is ejected under unsuitable conditions, e. g. on uneven ground. The door is automatically closed only when a bale pass sensor has submitted a signal to the baler controller indicating that the bale has passed the door. Resumption of the baling operation is also only possible when the door is closed, since otherwise a resume baling operation signal would be ignored by the baler controller.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The baler comprises a number of elements and actuators that need to be brought into a suitable position or operation mode before a baling operation is started or resumed after a bale ejection. Examples are a tensioning system of aprons surrounding the baling chamber, a door actuator, a position control means of the crop receiving means, and a PTO of the tractor. It is proposed to put them automatically into the suitable position or operation mode or to wait until the operator has done it, preferably after he has obtained a suitable hint on a user interface, and to enable a start of the driven ground engaging means of the tractor for a baling operation only when they are all in a suitable position or operating mode, and when the operator has confirmed to continue baling.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a combination of a tractor and a baler, wherein the tractor comprises: a tractor frame, ground engaging means supporting the tractor frame upon the ground, steering means for steering the tractor and an electronic tractor steering controller operable to control the steering means, the baler comprises: a baler frame coupled or connected to the tractor frame, a crop receiving means supported on the baler frame for receiving crop from a field, a baling chamber supported on the baler frame for pressing crop received by the crop receiving means to a bale, a bale shape sensor associated with the baling chamber for detecting the shape of a bale within the baling chamber, and an electronic baler controller connected to the bale shape sensor, the baler controller connected to the steering controller, wherein the steering controller is connected to a swath sensor and operable to automatically steer the tractor along a swath based upon the signals of the crop swath sensor and of the bale shape sensor such that a uniform bale shape is obtained. The tractor is thus automatically driven along a swath, trying to get a uniform bale shape and density and to pick all crop from the ground.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a lateral view of tractor <b>10</b> and a round baler <b>12</b> coupled to a drawbar hitch <b>15</b> of the tractor <b>10</b> by means of a drawbar <b>14</b>. The tractor <b>10</b> is supported on a frame <b>18</b>, which is supported on steerable front wheels <b>20</b> and movable rear wheels <b>22</b> serving as ground engaging means, and supports a cabin <b>24</b> wherein the operator's workstation <b>26</b> is located. In the following, direction indications as front and rear, left and right, are given with respect to the normal forward direction of the tractor <b>10</b> that goes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the left.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Tractor</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operator's workstation <b>26</b> includes a seat <b>28</b>, a steering wheel <b>30</b>, a gas pedal <b>16</b>, and another pedal for the brake and clutch (not shown), and input elements arranged in the operator's workstation <b>26</b> within reach of the operator for setting the selectable functions of the tractor <b>10</b>. The latter includes a selection device <b>32</b> for the transmission gear of a power take-off shaft gearbox <b>46</b>, a hand throttle lever <b>70</b>, a power take-off switch <b>68</b>, an input device <b>74</b> for setting a target torque value at the PTO output shaft <b>56</b>, and a virtual terminal <b>72</b> of a bus system that operates according to ISO 11783 with a keyboard <b>90</b> and a display device <b>94</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The selection device <b>32</b>, the input device <b>74</b>, and/or the power take-off switch <b>68</b> could also be implemented as menu items on the terminal <b>72</b>. Instead of the terminal <b>72</b>, any other input and display devices may be used. The gas pedal <b>16</b> is provided with a sensor that transmits electrical signals to an operator interface logic unit <b>64</b>, the electrical signals containing information on the particular position of the gas pedal <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates the drive assembly of the tractor <b>10</b> for driving the rear wheels <b>22</b> and a power take-off shaft <b>34</b> used for driving movable elements of the baler <b>12</b>. A driving engine <b>36</b>, usually a diesel engine, drives a shaft <b>38</b>, which, via a gearwheel <b>40</b>, is used to drive the rear wheels <b>22</b> and preferably also the front wheels <b>20</b>, and, if necessary, other movable devices of the tractor <b>10</b>, such as an air conditioning compressor and a power generator. The rear wheels <b>22</b>, and the front wheels <b>20</b>, are driven by the gearwheel <b>40</b> via a clutch <b>88</b> and a drive transmission with continuously variable transmission ratios, or with stepwise selectable ratios, but constant within the individual transmission stages, and a differential <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drive transmission can, for example, be a purely hydraulic transmission with a hydraulic pump driven by the clutch <b>88</b> and a hydraulic motor or hydrostatic transmission moving the wheels, wherein the transmission ratio of the gear can be changed by adjusting the swash plates of the pump and/or of the engine. In another embodiment, it is a multistage mechanical gearbox with a torque converter connected in series, such as used in passenger cars, or a mechanical gearbox with a sufficient number of transmission stages and an automatically switched clutch or planet gears and friction clutches. Also conceivable is the use of a drive transmission with step-less adjustable gearing, which for instance, works with V-belts that rotate around pulleys with adjustable diameters, or with a mechanical and a hydraulic (or electrical) drive path, wherein a planetary transmission comprises an element driven mechanically with a fixed or stepwise variable speed and one driven hydraulically or electrically with variable speed, and the third element is used for output. A combination of several of the mentioned transmissions would also be conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the illustrated embodiment, the drive transmission comprises a power shift transmission <b>92</b>, which contains planetary gear sets with clutches and brakes that facilitate the changeover of speeds under load, and a secondary, manually shifted, or synchromesh, transmission <b>76</b>. The power shift transmission <b>92</b> and the synchromesh transmission <b>76</b> are provided with actuators, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> respectively, for selecting the transmission stage. Since both actuators <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are controllable independently of one another, a high number of different transmission stages are available, derived by multiplying the number of transmission stages of the power shift transmission <b>92</b> with the number of transmission stages of the synchromesh transmission <b>76</b>. Further inserted in the drive train between the power shift transmission <b>92</b> and the synchromesh transmission <b>76</b> is a clutch <b>88</b>, which is movable through a clutch actuator <b>102</b> between a closed and open position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The shaft <b>38</b> is also connected to a hydraulically operable clutch <b>42</b>, which is connected to the output with an input shaft <b>44</b> of a power take-off gearbox <b>46</b>. The clutch <b>42</b> is actuated by means of an electromagnetic valve assembly <b>48</b>, which is also connected to a brake <b>50</b> positioned on the input shaft <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The power take-off gearbox <b>46</b> has three different, selectable transmission stages and therefore comprises three meshing gearwheel pairs. The transmission stage is selected by means of an electro-hydraulic (or electrical) actuator <b>52</b>. Movable clutch elements determine which of the three gearwheels arranged on a driven shaft <b>54</b> of the power take-off gearbox <b>46</b> is in positive torque connection with the driven shaft <b>54</b>. Alternatively, the actuator <b>52</b> could establish which of the three gearwheels arranged on the input shaft <b>44</b> is in positive torque connection with the input shaft <b>44</b>. The actuator <b>52</b> enables the selection of three transmission stages. In the illustrated embodiment, a first transmission stage provides, at a nominal driving engine speed of 2100 rpm, a driven shaft speed of 1000 rpm. A second transmission stage, at a lowered driving engine speed of 1800 rpm, the driven shaft speed is 540 rpm. A third transmission stage, at a nominal driving engine speed of 2100 rpm, the driven shaft speed is 540 rpm. Moreover, it is possible to not couple any of the gearwheels of the power take-off gearbox <b>46</b> with the input shaft <b>44</b> and the driven shaft <b>54</b>, thereby placing the power take-off gearbox <b>46</b> into a neutral position, wherein the driven shaft <b>54</b> is freely rotatable, even when the brake <b>50</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The driven shaft <b>54</b> is connected to a power take-off output shaft <b>56</b> in the form of a power take-off stub shaft. The power take-off shaft <b>34</b> of the baler <b>12</b>, equipped with a sleeve shaft end piece <b>58</b>, is slid onto the power take-off stub shaft. The power take-off shaft <b>34</b> is normally designed as a universal-joint propeller shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An electronic tractor controller <b>60</b> is connected to the valve assembly <b>48</b> and to the actuator <b>52</b>. Moreover, the electronic tractor controller <b>60</b> is connected to an operator interface logic unit <b>64</b> by means of a device bus <b>62</b> (e.g., CAN bus), which is connected to the selection device <b>32</b>, the input device <b>74</b>, the gas pedal <b>16</b>, the hand throttle lever <b>70</b>, and the power take-off switch <b>68</b>. The tractor controller <b>60</b> is moreover connected by the bus <b>62</b> to the virtual terminal <b>72</b>, the actuators <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, and the clutch actuator <b>102</b> of the clutch <b>88</b>. The selection device <b>32</b> comprises four pushbuttons, which are respectively assigned to the previously mentioned three transmission stages and to the neutral position of the power take-off gearbox <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The selection device <b>32</b> makes it easy for the operator, through manual operation of the four pushbuttons, to select one of the three transmission stages of the power take-off gearbox <b>46</b> or the neutral position. The user interface logic unit <b>64</b> transmits information on the operator's setting via the bus <b>62</b> to the tractor controller <b>60</b>, which controls the actuator <b>52</b> in accordance with the information received. Each transmission stage selected may be displayed to the operator by illuminating the assigned pushbutton of the transmission stage selection device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the operator puts the power take-off switch <b>68</b> into the operating position, the operator interface logic unit <b>64</b> transmits the corresponding information, via the bus <b>62</b>, to the tractor controller <b>60</b>, which prompts the valve assembly <b>48</b> to release the brake <b>50</b> and to engage the clutch <b>42</b>. If the operator puts the power take-off switch <b>68</b> into the non-operating position, the operator interface logic unit <b>64</b> analogously transmits corresponding information, via the bus <b>62</b>, to the tractor controller <b>60</b>, which prompts the valve assembly <b>48</b> to disengage the clutch <b>42</b> and to activate the brake <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tractor controller <b>60</b> is connected, via the bus <b>62</b>, to an engine controller <b>80</b>, which in turn controls an injection assembly <b>82</b> of the engine <b>36</b> and to which information about the respective speed of the shaft <b>38</b> is fed by a speed sensor <b>84</b>. A sensor <b>86</b> connected to the tractor controller <b>60</b> determines the torque transmitted by the driven shaft <b>54</b>. The speed sensor <b>84</b> may optically (through perforated rotary encoder discs connected to the shaft <b>38</b>) or magnetically (through magnets connected to the shaft <b>38</b>, which work together with induction coils, reed relays or hall sensors) interact with the associated shaft <b>38</b> to determine the speed. The speed may also be determined by other suitable means. The sensor <b>86</b> comprises strain gauges positioned on the driven shaft <b>54</b>, whose terminals are connected to the tractor controller <b>60</b> by means of sliding contacts, in order to determine the elastic torsion of the driven shaft <b>54</b> caused by the transmitted torque. Any other embodiments of the sensor <b>86</b> may be used, for instance, laser sensors for determining the torsion of the driven shaft <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The third input device <b>74</b> comprises three keys <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>. The first key <b>96</b> is used to switch on an automatic mode of operation and the other keys <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> to reduce (key <b>98</b>) or enlarge (key <b>100</b>) the target torque value at the driven shaft <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the tractor controller <b>60</b> instructs the engine-actuated control <b>80</b> to let the driving engine <b>36</b> run at a speed that corresponds to the current input of the selection device <b>32</b>, i.e., depending on the pressed key of the selection device <b>32</b>, with a fixed speed of 2100 rpm or 1800 rpm. Alternatively, the speed is entered by the operator via a torque input device (not shown) or via the virtual terminal <b>72</b>. If the neutral position is selected, the torque of the driving engine <b>36</b> will depend on the position of the gas pedal <b>16</b> or of the hand throttle lever <b>70</b>, or is entered by the operator, or is pre-set.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Baler</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the baler <b>12</b> comprises a baler frame <b>114</b> supported on wheels <b>116</b>. The frame <b>114</b> supports a baling chamber <b>112</b> surrounded by aprons <b>118</b> guided around rollers <b>120</b>. An arm <b>135</b> supporting a roller <b>122</b> can be moved upwardly and downwardly by means of a hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b>. The hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> is connected to the arm <b>135</b> via a lever <b>136</b> that is pivotally mounted at a horizontal axis <b>137</b>. The hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> thus defines the tension of the aprons <b>118</b>. Below the front edge of the baler <b>12</b>, a crop receiving means <b>126</b> in the form of a pickup with tines moving or rotating around a transverse axis followed in a crop flow direction by a conveyor belt <b>128</b> is located. The conveyor belt <b>128</b> could also be replaced by a rotor (not shown), or a rotor could be inserted in the crop flow direction between the crop receiving means and the conveyor belt <b>128</b>. Instead of the pickup, any other suitable crop receiving means could be used, like mowing and conveying units. The crop receiving means <b>126</b> collects crop lying in a swath <b>130</b> of grass, hay or straw on the field and feeds it into the baling chamber <b>112</b>. The aprons <b>118</b> define a baling chamber <b>112</b> of a variable size. The aprons <b>118</b> are set into motion in their longitudinal direction during a baling process, since one or more of the rollers <b>120</b> is rotatively driven. The crop introduced into the baling chamber <b>112</b> is thus also rotating during baling, while the size of the baling chamber <b>112</b> increases over time since the bale causes arm <b>135</b> to move downwardly against the force of the cylinder <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A rear door <b>132</b> is pivotally mounted to the frame <b>114</b> at an axis <b>134</b> extending transversely to the forward direction of the tractor <b>10</b> and the baler <b>12</b> located on the roof of the baler <b>12</b>. A door actuator <b>138</b> in the form of a hydraulic cylinder is mounted with one end to the frame <b>114</b> and with a second end to the rear door <b>132</b>. The rear door <b>132</b> supports the rollers <b>120</b> surrounding the rear part of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. Actuator <b>138</b> is connected to the rear door <b>132</b> such that it can pivot the rear door <b>132</b> upwardly (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> counter-clockwise) around axis <b>134</b> to be able to eject a bale from the baling chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On board of the baler <b>12</b>, a baler controller <b>110</b> is provided. The baler controller <b>110</b> is connected to the tractor controller <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) via bus <b>62</b> by means of a cable with a releasable plug connected to a socket at the rear of the tractor frame <b>18</b> or via a radio connection. The baler controller <b>110</b> is additionally connected to a number of sensors and actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A rear door sensor <b>140</b> connected to the baler controller <b>110</b> is mounted at the lower rear end of the baler frame <b>114</b> close to the lower front edge of the rear door <b>132</b> and is sensing whether the rear door <b>132</b> is closed or not by means of a switch actuated by the rear door <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A rear camera <b>142</b> is mounted to the lower rear face of the rear door <b>132</b>. It is connected to the baler controller <b>110</b>. The rear camera <b>142</b> provides video signals that can be displayed on the display device <b>94</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such that the operator can watch whether a bale is properly ejected. The signals of the rear camera <b>142</b> are additionally processed in an image processing system provided inside of or external to the baler controller <b>110</b> to provide an electronic indication whether a bale was properly ejected from the baling chamber <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Three bale size sensors <b>144</b> connected to the baler processor <b>110</b> are distributed over the width of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. They sense the distance to the surface of the bale and/or of aprons <b>118</b> abutting the bale surface and provide thus information about the bale diameter at their respective location along the width of the bale. A first one of the bale size sensors <b>144</b> is assigned to a position close to the left edge of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. A second one of the bale size sensors <b>144</b> is assigned to a position close to center of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. A third one of the bale size sensors <b>144</b> is assigned to a position close to the right edge of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. The bale shape detected by the bale size sensors <b>144</b> can be permanently displayed to the operator on the display device <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A wrapping material dispenser <b>146</b> is located close to the baling chamber <b>112</b>. It is connected to the baler controller <b>110</b> and dispenses, once instructed so by the baler controller <b>110</b>, a wrapping material like twine, ribbon, net or wrapping sheet to the baling chamber <b>112</b>. The rotating bale catches or pulls the wrapping material such that it is then wrapped around the bale. A wrapping material movement sensor <b>148</b> is interacting with the wrapping material dispenser <b>146</b> and senses whether the bale is pulling the wrapping.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The crop receiving means <b>126</b> can be lifted by a hydraulic cylinder <b>152</b> that is controlled via an electromagnetic valve assembly <b>150</b> controlled by the baler controller <b>110</b>. Another electromagnetic valve assembly <b>154</b> is controlling the hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b>. The door actuator <b>138</b> is controlled by a third valve assembly <b>155</b>. The hydraulic fluid for controlling the hydraulic cylinders <b>124</b>, <b>152</b> and the door actuator <b>138</b> is provided by the hydraulic system of the tractor <b>10</b>. Sensors <b>156</b> and <b>158</b> assigned to the cylinders <b>152</b> respectively <b>124</b> provide information about the position of the cylinders <b>152</b>, <b>124</b> to the baler controller <b>110</b>. Another sensor <b>157</b> senses the position of the door actuator <b>138</b> or of the door <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At the front of the tractor <b>10</b>, a camera <b>160</b> viewing upon the swath <b>130</b> is mounted. The camera <b>160</b> provides a video signal to the tractor controller <b>60</b> that is processed in an image processing system provided inside of or external to the tractor controller <b>60</b> to provide an electronic indication about the location of the tractor <b>10</b> with respect to the swath.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Automatic Baling Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flow diagram schematically indicates how the shown tractor baler combination can be operated according to an embodiment of the invention. After start in step <b>200</b>, the tractor controller <b>60</b> and the baler controller <b>110</b> are initiated, i.e. suitable software is loaded into their memories at step <b>202</b>. In step <b>204</b>, the engine <b>36</b> is started once the operator turns an ignition key or depresses a designated key.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, in step <b>206</b> a desired tractor speed is defined. In a preferred embodiment, the propulsion speed of the tractor <b>10</b> is initially specified by the gas pedal <b>16</b> or the hand throttle lever <b>70</b>. The tractor controller <b>60</b> then controls the actuators <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and, before and after operating the actuator <b>106</b>, the clutch actuator <b>102</b> for disengaging and engaging the clutch <b>88</b>, so that the drive transmission drives the wheels <b>22</b> at the desired speed. The torque at the driven shaft <b>54</b>, measured by the sensor <b>86</b>, is displayed on the display device <b>94</b> of the virtual terminal <b>72</b>. As soon as the displayed torque corresponds to a target torque value that is optimal and appropriate for the attachment <b>12</b>, the operator can operate the key <b>96</b> of the input device <b>74</b>. The tractor controller <b>60</b> then ignores the inputs from the gas pedal <b>16</b> or the hand throttle lever <b>70</b>, and by operating the actuators <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, adjusts the propulsion speed of the machine <b>10</b> such that the torque measured by the sensor <b>86</b> at least approximately corresponds to the target torque value. Key <b>98</b> facilitates a step-by-step decrease of the target torque value and key <b>100</b> facilitates a step-by-step increase of the target torque value, e.g., in increments of 10 Nm. Alternatively, or in addition, the desired target torque value may be entered via the keyboard <b>90</b> of the virtual terminal <b>72</b> as a numerical value. Furthermore, the manufacturer and type of attachment <b>12</b> may be entered via the keyboard <b>90</b> and the control unit <b>90</b> derives the target torque value therefrom using a database. The target torque value can also be stored in memory, connected to the bus <b>62</b>, on board the attachment <b>12</b>, and the tractor controller <b>60</b> obtains it from the memory <b>108</b> as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>208</b>, the baler controller <b>110</b> evaluates the signals from the three bale size sensors <b>114</b> and investigates whether any one of them indicates that the bale size is larger than a second bale size. This second bale size is slightly (e.g. 10 cm in diameter) smaller than a first bale size corresponding to a desired bale size input by the operator by means of the keyboard <b>90</b>. If the second size has not been reached, step <b>208</b> is performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the other hand, if the bale size is equal to or larger than the second size, step <b>210</b> is executed, in which the baler controller <b>110</b> sends a deceleration signal to instruct the tractor controller <b>60</b> to decelerate the tractor <b>10</b> and to drive it with a certain, relatively small speed (e.g. 4 km/h).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In following step <b>212</b>, the baler controller <b>110</b> again evaluates the signals from the three bale size sensors <b>114</b> and investigates whether any one of them indicates that the bale size is larger than the first bale size. If the first size has not been reached, step <b>208</b> is performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, if the bale size is equal to or larger than the first size, step <b>214</b> is executed, in which the baler controller <b>110</b> instructs the wrapping material dispenser <b>146</b> to dispense a wrapping material to the bale. If necessary or useful, the crop receiving means <b>126</b> could be lifted by the cylinder <b>152</b> upon command of the baler controller <b>110</b> before the wrapping material dispenser <b>146</b> is operated. Step <b>216</b> follows, in which the baler controller <b>110</b> checks according to the signals provided by the wrapping material movement sensor <b>148</b> whether the bale has caught and thus pulls the wrapping material. If this is not true, step <b>216</b> is performed again, otherwise step <b>218</b> is performed, in which the baler controller <b>110</b> sends a halt signal to the tractor controller <b>60</b> which then stops the tractor. Step <b>220</b> follows, in which the wrapping operation is performed and its end is awaited. An error signal is submitted from the baler controller <b>110</b> to the display <b>94</b> when the wrapping material movement sensor does not submit a signal to the baler controller <b>110</b> indicating that the wrapping material is pulled by the bale after the baler controller <b>110</b> has commanded the wrapping material dispenser <b>146</b> to dispense a wrapping material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thereafter, in step <b>222</b> a bale ejection signal to be input via keyboard <b>90</b> is awaited from the operator, after a corresponding message has been displayed via display device <b>94</b> or brought acoustically to the operator's attention. The operator has thus the chance to bring the tractor <b>10</b> and baler <b>12</b> into another position when the actual position is not suited to eject a bale, e.g. on uneven terrain. Once the bale ejection signal is received, step <b>224</b> is executed in which the baler controller <b>110</b> instructs the valve assembly <b>154</b> controlling the hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> to untension the aprons <b>118</b> and commands the valve assembly <b>155</b> to actuate the door actuator <b>138</b> to open the rear door <b>132</b>. Then, in step <b>226</b> the bale is ejected by gravitation, since a support of the lower rear parts of the bale by the rear door <b>132</b> is lacking. Additionally, it would be possible to drive the conveyor belt <b>128</b> below the baling chamber <b>112</b> by means of a clutch controlled by the baler controller <b>110</b> in a clockwise direction to eject the bale. If there would be a rear ramp at the exit of the baler <b>12</b>, it could also be lowered under control of the baler controller <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>228</b>, it is checked based upon the video signals from the camera <b>142</b>, whether the bale has been properly ejected from the baling chamber <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the bale has, according to the video signals, indeed exited the baling chamber <b>112</b>, step <b>230</b> is performed in which the valve assembly <b>155</b> controlling the door actuator <b>138</b> is instructed to close the door <b>132</b>. Otherwise an error message is displayed to the operator at step <b>232</b>. After step <b>230</b>, the baler controller <b>110</b> checks in step <b>234</b> whether the rear door sensor <b>140</b> indicates that the rear door <b>132</b> has been closed. If this is not true, step <b>236</b> is performed in which an error message is displayed to the operator. The door position could also be checked based upon the signals of sensor <b>157</b>, the door sensor <b>140</b> can thus be omitted. On the other hand, if the door <b>132</b> is closed, step <b>238</b> follows in which the baler controller <b>110</b> checks whether the aprons <b>118</b> are tensioned, i.e. according to the signal of the sensor <b>158</b> whether the hydraulic cylinder <b>124</b> is in an appropriate position, and according to the signal of the sensor <b>156</b> whether the crop receiving means <b>126</b> are lowered and according to an information from the tractor controller <b>60</b>, whether the PTO shaft <b>56</b> is rotating. If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, an error message is given to the operator in step <b>240</b>. It would also be possible to let the baler controller <b>110</b> actuate the involved actuators to bring the respective elements automatically into a working position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, when all conditions in step <b>238</b> are fulfilled, step <b>242</b> is performed in which a resume baling operation message is displayed and/or acoustically brought to the attention of the operator. In the next step <b>244</b>, the baler controller <b>110</b> awaits a resume baling operation signal from the operator which can be input by means of the keyboard <b>90</b>. If this message is not received, e.g. when the operator is not prepared to continue baling, since he is having a rest or wants to drive the tractor <b>10</b> to another location, step <b>244</b> is performed again. If the resume baling operation signal is received, the baling operation is resumed in step <b>246</b> in which the tractor <b>10</b> is accelerated to the last speed it had before step <b>208</b>. After step <b>246</b>, step <b>206</b> is performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In case that an error message is displayed (steps <b>232</b>, <b>236</b> and <b>240</b>) or acoustically brought to the attention of the operator, the operator can check the situation, if necessary take steps to resolve possible problems and once they are resolved, input a corresponding confirmation to the baler controller <b>110</b> via the keyboard <b>90</b>. Control then continues with the previous steps (<b>228</b>, <b>234</b> or <b>238</b>) that led to the error message.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a possible embodiment, steps <b>234</b> to <b>244</b> could also be inserted into the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> between steps <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>, in order to have an automatic check of the baler <b>12</b> status already before the first bale is baled. The confirmation signals in steps <b>222</b> and <b>244</b> could also be input by the operator via any other suitable means, for example a confirmation key on a joystick or on the hand throttle lever <b>70</b>. The described automatic operation makes control of the baler <b>12</b> significantly easier for the operator, since a number of processes are performed automatically. Any significant action of the operator on a brake pedal, the gas pedal <b>16</b>, an emergency push button, or the hand throttle lever <b>70</b> would disable the automatic baling operation and halt all functions.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Automatic Steering Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to make work for the operator even easier, a second aspect of the present invention is directed towards an automatic steering operation of the tractor <b>10</b> during the baling operation. The steering operation described is additionally attempting to obtain an exactly cylindrical shape of the bale.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The steering operation is performed by the tractor controller <b>60</b> using the video signal from the camera <b>160</b> and the signals from the bale size sensors <b>144</b> that are provided to the tractor controller <b>60</b> by the baler controller <b>110</b>. The camera <b>160</b> could be replaced or supplemented by two swath position sensors <b>162</b> detecting independently the position of the edges of the swath <b>130</b> installed on each side of the tractor <b>10</b>. These sensors are in an embodiment mounted below the tractor sides and measure the lateral distance to the vertical flanges of the swath, for example using ultrasound. In another embodiment, the tractor <b>10</b> could be provided with a GPS antenna receiving position data and a memory in which the position of the swath <b>130</b> that is known from previous working (swathing) operations is stored. The tractor <b>10</b> could then be steered such that the actual tractor position data provided by the GPS antenna and the swath position data from the memory match. Steering data could also be calculated by the baler processor <b>110</b> or by a separate steering processor not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The tractor controller <b>60</b> is via an electromagnetic valve assembly <b>166</b> also connected to a steering cylinder <b>164</b> that controls the steering angle of the front wheels <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The steering operation is controlled according to a process schematically indicated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. After start in step <b>300</b>, the width W of the swath and the offset D of the center axis of the swath from the center axis of the tractor <b>10</b> is calculated in step <b>302</b>, using the signals of the camera <b>160</b> processed in an image processing system provided inside of or external to the tractor controller <b>60</b> and/or from the swath position sensors <b>162</b>, or from the GPS antenna and the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">in step <b>304</b>, it is checked whether the width W of the swath is smaller than the width Wb of the baling chamber <b>112</b>. If this is not the case, i.e. the baler has the same width as the swath or even less, the tractor is then in step <b>306</b> steered left or right dependent on the offset D to keep centered on the swath <b>130</b>. Step <b>302</b> follows upon step <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, if according to step <b>304</b> the swath width is smaller than the width of the baling chamber <b>112</b>, step <b>308</b> is executed, in which a value &#x394;width is calculated that corresponds to the absolute value of the difference between the width of the baling chamber <b>112</b> and the width of the swath <b>130</b>. In step <b>310</b>, the tractor controller <b>60</b> reads a signal from the right bale size sensor <b>144</b> and in step <b>312</b>, it reads a signal from the left bale size sensor <b>144</b>. Information on a bale shape deviation &#x394;S from a cylindrical shape is calculated in step <b>314</b> by subtracting the two bale size values from the sensors <b>144</b> from steps <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If the absolute value of the bale shape deviation &#x394;S is not larger than a predetermined threshold, what is checked in step <b>316</b>, step <b>318</b> is performed. In step <b>318</b>, the steering cylinder <b>164</b> is controlled such that the offset D gets larger than &#x394;width/2&#x2212;5 cm and smaller than &#x394;width/2+5 cm. Of course the border limits of the offset D can be also fine-tuned by taking in account the width of the crop receiving means. Since D is positive, the tractor <b>10</b> is steered to the left side of the swath <b>130</b>. In an example, if W=70 cm, Wb=120 cm, &#x394;width would be 50 cm, such that the tractor controller <b>60</b> would attempt to get D between 20 and 30 cm, thus steer the tractor to the left such that the swath <b>130</b> is offset to the right from the tractor axis by 20 to 30 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If on the other hand in step <b>316</b> the bale shape deviation is larger than the predetermined threshold, step <b>320</b> is executed, according to which the steering cylinder <b>164</b> is controlled such that the offset &#x2212;D gets larger than &#x394;width/2&#x2212;5 cm and smaller than &#x394;width/2+5 cm. Now the tractor <b>10</b> is steered to the right, such that it gets to the left side of the swath, since D is negative. With the figures from the example above, the tractor <b>10</b> would be steered 20 to 30 cm to the right side of the swath <b>130</b>. After steps <b>318</b> and <b>320</b>, step <b>302</b> is performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The tractor is thus steered in relatively large curves along the swath <b>130</b> such that the swath <b>130</b> enters alternatingly close to the left and right end of the crop receiving means <b>126</b> in order to obtain a cylindrical bale shape, but no crop is left on the field.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When also the signals provided by the center bale size sensor <b>144</b> would be considered, one could in step <b>316</b> calculate whether the bale is barrel shaped (i.e. the bale has a larger diameter in the center than at its edges) and if this is true, increase the offset D to a value larger than &#x394;width/2+5 cm and smaller than &#x394;width/2+15 cm. The offset can however not be increased too much because the tractor wheels <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> would then ride on the swath <b>130</b>. If the bale is hour-glass shaped (i.e. the bale has a smaller diameter in the center than at its edges), the offset width would be reduced to lie between &#x394;width/2&#x2212;15 cm and smaller than &#x394;width/2&#x2212;5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The tractor controller <b>60</b> could also check whether the swath <b>130</b> is curved, and when this is the case, adjust the offset D accordingly, by increasing positive values and decreasing negative values when turning right and the opposite when turning left.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the bale size approaches the desired (first) size, the threshold for the bale shape signal &#x394;S could be reduced according to a rule based on how fast &#x394;S has been varying during bale formation, in order to achieve a perfectly cylindrical bale.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the tractor controller <b>60</b> would not be able to compute a satisfactory information about the swath <b>130</b>, the operator would be warned acoustically and/or via a message shown on display device <b>94</b> that he has to steer on his own, and preferably the tractor <b>10</b> would also halt automatically unless the operator takes over steering. Any significant action on the steering wheel <b>30</b> would also disable the automatic steering function.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims.</p>
