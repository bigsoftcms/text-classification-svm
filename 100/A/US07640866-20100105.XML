<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of, and priority from, U.S. Provisional Application 60/779,384 having a filing date of Mar. 3, 2006 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as is fully set forth herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to video display platforms and more particularly to a mobile station adapted to support a flat panel display and associated peripheral equipment which is adjustable to satisfy ergonomic and operational needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Portable stations incorporating video monitors are generally known. However, such portable stations typically provide limited capacity for adjustment of the video monitor and/or a work surface used in conjunction with the video monitor. In this regard, it is believed that existing systems are particularly ill equipped to incorporate large, flat panel monitors of substantial width and mass.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As will be appreciated, flat panel monitors are typically heavy, bulky, and difficult to maneuver. Moreover, the clarity of images on such monitors is typically highly dependent upon the orientation relative the viewer. Thus, a person utilizing such a flat panel monitor either as a passive viewer or as part of a workstation or other interactive system may be required to adjust his or her body position relative to the monitor in order to provide good viewing. However, such body adjustment may be undesirable and/or impractical for many users. In particular, such adjustment may cause undesirable muscular or skeletal strain if engaged in for prolonged periods of time. Likewise, persons with limited mobility such as those confined to wheel chairs or hospital beds may find such adjustment impossible to make even for short periods of time. Moreover, even for those users who can readily adjust their body positions, it may be desirable to change positions from time to time such as from a sitting to a standing orientation so as to avoid issues such as deep vain thrombosis, carpal tunnel syndrome and the like which may be more pronounced when a user maintains substantially the same position over prolonged periods. Thus, while there is a desire to utilize interactive monitors of increasing size, there is a lack of systems to support and transport such video systems and associated interactive hardware.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides advantages and/or alternatives over the known art by providing a portable, adjustable support system for large scale, flat monitors and associated hardware. In particular, the portable support system is fully self-contained and is full adjustable so as to allow a user to interact with the monitor from a range of positions including standing, sitting, or lying down through variation of the height and/or angle of the monitor.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">While the invention has been illustrated and generally described above and will herein after be described in connection with certain potentially preferred embodiments and practices, it is to be understood that in no event is the invention limited to such illustrated and described embodiments and practices. On the contrary it is intended that the present invention shall extend to all alternatives and modifications as may embrace the general principles of this invention within the full and true spirit and scope thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made to the various figures wherein like elements are designated by like reference numerals throughout the various views. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a flat panel monitor support system <b>10</b> such as may be used to support a flat panel monitor <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As illustrated, the support system <b>10</b> includes a base <b>14</b> incorporating a plurality of casters <b>16</b> or the like to permit the base <b>14</b> and attached structures to be readily moved by rolling from place to place. In the illustrated and potentially preferred embodiment, the base <b>14</b> incorporates a pair of lateral legs <b>18</b> with an interconnecting support structure <b>20</b> extending between the lateral legs <b>18</b> to form a substantially &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped platform framework. As will be described more fully hereinafter, the interconnecting support structure <b>20</b> may serve as a platform for housing hardware such as a computer, external drives, a DVD player or the like used in conjunction with monitor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the base <b>14</b> includes a pair of telescoping support arms <b>22</b> extending upwardly from the lateral legs <b>18</b>. As shown, the support arms <b>22</b> preferably incorporate a multiplicity of telescoping segments so as to permit extension to varying heights. In this regard, it is to be understood that while the telescoping sections are illustrated as being substantially rectangular in configuration, any other suitable geometry including circular cross-sections, square cross-sections, and the like may be used as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the terminal ends of the support arms <b>22</b> are preferably attached to a cross-member <b>30</b> such as a hollow beam of rectangular beam cross-section or the like. As shown, the cross-member <b>30</b> houses a supporting framework on the beam portion including a pair of spaced finger plates <b>32</b> disposed between a pair of upwardly projecting lateral support plates <b>34</b>. A pair of surface mounting plates <b>36</b> preferably extends away from the interior edge of the cross-member for mounting to an underside of a table surface <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>) such as by screws or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lateral support plates <b>34</b> preferably have a substantially pyramidal profile with an upper apex portion projecting through aligned slot openings in the table surface <b>40</b> for attachment to legs <b>42</b> of a mounting plate structure <b>50</b>. An adjustable length linkage <b>52</b> such as a telescoping arm, extensible piston or other adjustable length structure is preferably operatively connected at a position between the upwardly curved spaced fingers <b>32</b> such as by a pin connection or the like (not shown) extending through openings in the fingers <b>32</b>. The adjustable length linkage extends from the operative connection at the fingers <b>32</b> of the cross-member framework to the mounting frame of the mounting plate structure <b>50</b>. Thus, by extending or retracting the adjustable length linkage <b>52</b>, the mounting plate structure may be caused to rotate around the connection points between the legs <b>42</b> and the lateral support plates <b>34</b>. As will be appreciated, when a monitor <b>12</b> is supported on the mounting plate structure <b>50</b>, such rotation translates to a vertical tilt adjustment of the monitor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is contemplated that the extension and retraction of support arms <b>22</b> and adjustable linkage <b>52</b> may be activated and controlled by a user through use of actuators such as electro-mechanical motor driven actuators, mechanical actuators, pneumatic actuators or the like as will be well known to those of skill in the art. In this regard, it is contemplated that either a single actuator or multiple actuators may be used to carry out vertical adjustment so as to raise or lower the cross-member <b>30</b> and all attached components. In the event that multiple actuators are used such as a separate actuator for each of the support arms <b>22</b>, such multiple actuators will preferably be synchronized so as to lift or lower in concert with one another. Of course, it is also contemplated that manual adjustment techniques such as the use of spring loaded pins engaging spaced apart openings along the length of the telescoping member may be used if desired either alone or in combination with appropriate actuating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As previously indicated, the interconnecting support structure <b>20</b> running between the lateral legs <b>18</b> provides a support surface for hardware used in conjunction with the monitor <b>12</b>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, this support surface is bounded by a forward wall <b>60</b> disposed across the interior edge of the interconnecting support structure <b>20</b> and a rear wall <b>62</b> affixed along a rear edge of the interconnecting support structure <b>20</b>. In the illustrated and potentially preferred embodiment, a cable collection terminal <b>64</b> such as a hollow structural sleeve member or the like extends between the forward wall <b>60</b> and the rear wall <b>62</b> adjacent the upper edges of those walls. The cable collection terminal <b>64</b> thus assists in stabilizing the wall structures <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The cable collection terminal <b>64</b> also preferably includes openings for acceptance of cables from support devices to be fed through a flexible cable sleeve <b>66</b> mounted between the cable collection terminal <b>64</b> and an opening in the underside of the cross member <b>30</b> or other position as may be desired. Thus, cables may be run from a computer or other device housed on the interconnecting support structure <b>20</b> though the cable collection terminal <b>64</b> and into the flexible cable sleeve <b>66</b> for passage through the cross member and final exit through a slot <b>70</b> or other opening in the table surface for ultimate connection to the monitor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be appreciated, by providing a support surface for equipment such as computers and the like in conjunction with a connection system which permits substantial adjustment of the monitor position, the entire system is readily transportable and adjustable to a wide variety of environments. In moving the system, there is no requirement to disconnect hardware from the monitor in order to move such hardware separately.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As previously noted, the support system may be particularly useful as a workstation for interactive use by a person. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate an embodiment of the invention particularly adapted for use with a keyboard <b>172</b> or other user interface device. In these figures, elements corresponding to those previously described are designated by like reference numerals increased by 100. As shown, a keyboard support <b>174</b> is disposed at the underside of the table surface <b>140</b> held in place by an extensible arm element <b>176</b> such as a telescoping rotating arm or the like extending from the cross member. Thus, a user may pull the keyboard support downwardly and away from the underside of the table surface to a level and distance away from the table surface as may be desired for manipulation of the keyboard <b>172</b>. The keyboard support <b>172</b> preferably includes an attached pad support <b>173</b> which may be used for the manipulation of a mouse or other electronic interface and/or as a support for hand writing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an interactive configuration as shown, the interconnecting support structure may support a computer <b>180</b> or other device operated through commands at the keyboard <b>172</b> and/or mouse. In a potentially preferred practice, the keyboard <b>172</b> and mouse are preferably wireless in order to avoid cable entanglement, however, wired hardware components may likewise be utilized if desired. A construction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be particularly well suited for graphics applications such as drafting and the like. However, such a construction may also be used for any number of other purposes as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, the support system <b>110</b> may be manipulated into place such as by rolling using the casters <b>116</b>. Once the appropriate position is obtained, a first set of vertical actuator controls <b>190</b> may then be used to raise or lower the table surface <b>140</b> to a desired height. Upon achieving a desired height, a second set of actuator controls <b>192</b> may then be used to adjust the tilt angle of the monitor <b>112</b> so as to tilt the monitor either toward or away from a user who may be either seated or standing in front of the keyboard support. Likewise, the keyboard support <b>174</b> may be pulled down and away from the table surface to any extent as may be desired. Thus, a user is provided with at least three independent adjustments which may be used in combination to obtain a desired configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be appreciated, the various embodiments of the invention provide substantial benefits in terms of the mobility and manipulation of systems utilizing a large flat panel monitor. In particular, both the monitor and all supporting devices including computers and the like may be readily transported from place to place without the need to disconnect components. In addition, the monitor itself may be adjusted to varying heights and/or angles without necessitating any such disconnection. Accordingly, substantially enhanced freedom of use is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is to be understood that while the present invention has been illustrated and described in relation to potentially preferred embodiments, constructions, and procedures, that such embodiments, constructions, and procedures are illustrative only and that the invention is in no event to be limited thereto. Rather, it is contemplated that modifications and variations embodying the principals of the invention will no doubt occur to those of skill in the art. It is therefore contemplated and intended that the present invention shall extend to all such modifications and variations as may incorporate a broad concept of the invention within the true spirit and scope thereof.</p>
