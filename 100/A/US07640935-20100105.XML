<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a unit for feeding filters to a filter tip attachment machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional filter tip attachment machines are associated typically with filter makers designed to form a continuous filter rod such as can be advanced longitudinally though a cutter head and divided into discrete sticks of length corresponding to a multiple of the length of the filter tip attached to a single cigarette. The cut sticks are then intercepted and fed along a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction followed by the rod, utilizing diverter devices of conventional type such as will convert the axial movement the stick into a movement transverse to its longitudinal axis, and directed thus into the infeed hopper of a filter tip attachment machine. Thereafter, the filter sticks are taken up from the bottom of the hopper onto a roller with peripheral flutes and, still advancing in a direction transverse to their longitudinal axes, conveyed into a further cutting station where they are cut transversely in such a way as to generate double length filter plugs, that is to say plugs twice the length of the filter tip associated with a single cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been found that conventional units for feeding filters as outlined above are unable, when used in combination with ultra high speed filter tip attachment machines of the current generation, to guarantee a constant and correctly ordered supply of filter sticks to the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the feed units currently in use are not able to ensure a swift and precise compensation of differences in output between the filter making and filter tip attachment machines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to provide a unit for feeding filters to a filter tip attachment machine that will be unaffected by the drawbacks mentioned above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The stated object is realized in a unit for feeding filters to a filter tip attachment machine, as recited in claim <b>1</b> appended.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, <b>1</b> denotes an infeed portion of a filter tip attachment machine, and <b>2</b> denotes a unit, in its entirety, for feeding filters <b>3</b> to the aforementioned infeed portion <b>1</b>; the unit <b>2</b> comprises a dispensing hopper <b>4</b> of which the outlet is coupled to the periphery of a roller <b>5</b> presenting a succession of axially oriented flutes or grooves, not illustrated, each able to acconmodate a respective filter <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The roller <b>5</b> is designed to advance the filters <b>3</b> in succession along a direction transverse to their longitudinal axes and through a cutting station <b>6</b>, where each one is cut transversely in such a way as to generate a predetermined number (generally three) of double length filter plugs (not illustrated), that is to say filters twice the length of a filter tip associated with a single cigarette, before being conveyed by a train of rollers <b>7</b> toward a user station not shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The unit <b>2</b> feeding the filters <b>3</b> also comprises a receiving hopper <b>8</b> and a substantially horizontal channel <b>9</b> by which this same hopper <b>8</b> is connected to the dispensing hopper <b>4</b>. The receiving hopper <b>8</b>, which feeds into the channel <b>9</b>, is filled in its turn with filters by feed means denoted <b>10</b> in their entirety and, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprising three diverter devices <b>11</b> arranged in tiers and serving to redirect the filters <b>3</b> from a longitudinal path of movement onto a transverse path. In particular, each diverter device <b>11</b> comprises a first pair <b>12</b> and a second pair <b>13</b> of rollers <b>14</b>, the two rollers <b>14</b> of each pair <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> occupying a common vertical plane, and the four rollers combining to create a channel <b>15</b> that extends from the upstream pair <b>12</b> through the downstream pair <b>13</b> and emerges into the receiving hopper <b>8</b>. Filters turned out by a filter making machine (not illustrated) and advancing along a longitudinal path perpendicular to the viewing plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are taken up by the rollers <b>14</b> of the first pair <b>12</b> and diverted onto a path extending transversely to their longitudinal axes, passing along the aforementioned channel <b>15</b> between the rollers <b>14</b> of the second pair <b>13</b> and into the receiving hopper <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the unit <b>2</b> comprises an inline storage facility or buffer <b>16</b> of elongated geometry and variable volume, located above the feed channel <b>9</b>, interposed between the channel <b>9</b> and the diverter devices <b>11</b> and extending from the receiving hopper <b>8</b> to the dispensing hopper <b>4</b>, of which the inlet end coincides substantially with the receiving hopper <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The feed channel <b>9</b> is delimited at the bottom by the top branch <b>17</b> of a horizontal conveyor <b>18</b> looped around two return pulleys denoted <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, located respectively at the upstream and downstream ends. The downstream pulley <b>20</b> is power driven by a relative motor <b>21</b>, and the active surface of the conveyor <b>18</b> offered in contact to the filters <b>3</b> presents a toothed profile <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The variable volume buffer <b>16</b> is delimited at the bottom by a wall consisting in the top branch <b>23</b> of a conveyor belt <b>24</b> looped at opposite ends around an upstream pulley <b>25</b> and a downstream pulley <b>26</b>, the former coupled to a motor <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Associated rigidly with the top branch <b>23</b> of the belt <b>24</b> is the bottom end of a substantially vertical wall <b>28</b> rendered capable of movement, generated by the motor <b>27</b>, between two limit positions of which the first, indicated in solid lines on the left as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, corresponds to a condition of minimum capacity afforded by the buffer <b>16</b>, and the second, indicated in phantom lines on the right as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, corresponds to a condition of maximum capacity afforded by the buffer <b>16</b>. It will be seen that in the condition of minimum capacity, the movable wall <b>28</b> functions as a side wall of the receiving hopper <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bottom branch <b>29</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b> runs above the horizontal channel <b>9</b> and is separated from the channel by a wall <b>30</b> serving to disallow contact between the filters <b>3</b> and the surface of the belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The receiving hopper <b>8</b> is equipped internally with sensors <b>31</b>, serving to monitor and control the mass of filters <b>3</b> accumulating internally of the hopper <b>8</b>, to which the motor <b>27</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b> is interlocked. More exactly, the sensors <b>31</b> are two in number, positioned in vertical alignment so that the lower of the two will sense a minimum replenishment value and the upper senses a maximum replenishment value for the hopper <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The dispensing hopper <b>4</b> likewise is equipped with respective means <b>32</b> by which to monitor and control the level of the mass of filters <b>3</b> accumulating internally of the hopper <b>4</b>, to which the motor <b>21</b> of the lower conveyor <b>18</b> is interlocked. Such means <b>32</b> comprise a hinged flap <b>33</b> resting on the mass of filters <b>3</b>, also a sensor <b>34</b> connected to the flap <b>33</b> and capable of indicating its angular position as determined by the level of the mass of filters <b>3</b> internally of the dispensing hopper <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the buffer <b>16</b> comprises two vertical side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> extending substantially perpendicular and parallel to the horizontal conveyor <b>18</b>. The two side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, of which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the rear wall <b>35</b> and a part of the front wall <b>36</b>, combine with a top wall <b>37</b> cantilevered from a frame <b>38</b> to define a box-like structure containing the entire unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The unit <b>2</b> comprises means, denoted <b>39</b> in their entirety, serving to vary the distance between the side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. In particular, such means <b>39</b> comprise a plurality of rods <b>40</b> of which the ends are connected by way of respective lead screw and nut couplings <b>41</b> to the two opposite walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rods <b>40</b> project externally of the buffer <b>16</b> on at least one side and are coupled via the respective ends to angle drive units <b>42</b> interconnected by line shafts <b>43</b>. At least one of the angle drive units <b>42</b> is connected to a power driven actuator <b>44</b> such as will set the angle drive units <b>42</b> and shafts <b>43</b> in motion and cause the rods <b>40</b> to rotate about their respective axes in one direction or the other.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, by causing the rods <b>40</b> to turn on the relative lead screw/nut couplings <b>41</b>, which present identical threads of opposite hand (one left, one right), the distance between the side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> can be adjusted to suit the length of the filters <b>3</b>. In operation, starting for example from a situation with the buffer <b>16</b> at minimum capacity, at the moment in which the mass of filters <b>3</b> in the receiving hopper <b>8</b> exceeds a predetermined maximum value, the level sensors <b>31</b> will pilot the motor <b>27</b> and the conveyor belt <b>24</b> to translate the movable wall <b>28</b> toward the dispensing hopper <b>4</b> in the direction of the arrow denoted F<b>1</b>, thereby increasing the capacity of the buffer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Conversely, when the mass of filters <b>3</b> in the receiving hopper <b>8</b> drops below a minimum level, the sensors <b>31</b> will trigger the return of the movable wall <b>28</b> back toward the hopper <b>8</b>, in the direction of the arrow denoted F<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The movable wall <b>28</b> thus provides means by which to vary the volume of the buffer <b>16</b>, whilst the motor <b>27</b> and the relative conveyor belt <b>24</b> provide means by which to set the wall <b>28</b> in motion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The movement of the horizontal conveyor <b>18</b> and its linear speed is controlled by the motor <b>21</b>, which is interlocked in operation to the sensors <b>34</b> monitoring the angular movement of the flap <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an alternative embodiment of the unit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, also described and illustrated in European Patent 523,613, to which reference may be made for a fuller description, filters <b>3</b> are supplied to the unit <b>2</b> by feed means <b>10</b> comprising at least one device <b>45</b> by which the filters <b>3</b> are introduced axially. The device <b>45</b> in question comprises an elongated body <b>46</b> extending between the side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> of the buffer <b>16</b> and centred on an axis <b>47</b> perpendicular to the walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. The elongated body <b>46</b> is insertable through an opening <b>48</b> in the wall denoted <b>36</b>, located in a substantially central position relative to the receiving hopper <b>8</b>, and connected thus to one end of a cylindrical drum centred on the aforementioned axis <b>47</b>. The drum in question, not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> but clearly described and illustrated in EP 523,613, is rotatable internally of a cylindrical bushing <b>49</b> centred on the axis <b>47</b> and associated rigidly with the side wall <b>36</b>. The drum is rotatable as one with a gear <b>50</b> aligned concentrically with the axis <b>47</b> and in mesh with a driving gear <b>51</b> designed to set the drum and the elongated body <b>46</b> in rotation about the axis <b>47</b> at a predetermined angular velocity. The elongated body <b>46</b> presents a substantially cylindrical outer surface <b>52</b> of spiral cross-sectional outline, with a lengthwise groove <b>53</b>. The elongated body <b>46</b> is of length substantially equal to the distance between the two side walls <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> and presents an axial bore <b>54</b> of which one end <b>55</b>, offered to the rear side wall <b>35</b>, is flared frustoconically. The drum is connected to one end of an axial feed duct <b>56</b> through which the filters <b>3</b> are carried toward the buffer, the other end of the duct being connected to a ball joint <b>57</b> located downstream, relative to the direction along which the filters <b>3</b> advance toward the receiving hopper <b>8</b>, of a pair of rollers <b>58</b> by which the filters are taken up and directed along the duct <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation, the rotary motion of the drum internally of the bushing <b>49</b> is accompanied by a rotation of the elongated body <b>46</b> about the relative axis <b>47</b> and a translational movement of the duct <b>56</b>, downstream of the ball joint <b>57</b>, describing a cone denoted <b>59</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The rotation of the elongated body <b>46</b> within the mass of filters <b>3</b> occupying the hopper <b>8</b> has the effect of distancing these same filters <b>3</b> from the axis <b>47</b> and creating a void that can be filled by the filters <b>3</b> directed along the duct <b>56</b> by the rollers <b>58</b>.</p>
