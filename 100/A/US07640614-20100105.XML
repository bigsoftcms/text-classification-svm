<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of toothbrushes, and more particularly, the invention relates to the field of electrically powered toothbrushes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most known electric toothbrushes utilize a single bristle carrier that is powered or otherwise driven by an electric motor incorporated in the toothbrush. The bristle carriers in these toothbrushes undergo a wide array of motions. For example, bristle carriers undergoing rotary motion are well known. Bristle carriers that reciprocate in a linear fashion within the plane of the brush are also known. And, bristle carriers that reciprocate in a linear fashion perpendicular to the plane of the brush are also known. Although satisfactory in certain respects, a need still exists for an improved powered toothbrush design.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous attempts have been made to improve the design, efficiency, cleaning efficacy, simplicity, and/or commercial viability of electric toothbrushes. One approach has been the provision of multiple powered bristle carriers. Most artisans have grouped multiple sets of bristles along an end of a brush and incorporated a drive mechanism for simultaneously rotating each of the bristle sets, together. Exemplary designs include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,242,516; 4,156,620; 4,845,795; 5,088,145; 5,020,179; 4,827,550; and 4,545,087, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A related strategy is to group sets of bristles on multiple rotating bristle carriers, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,140,307 and 5,170,525, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. Rather than rotating each individual bristle set about its center, i.e. the approach adopted in the previously noted patents, the designs described in the '307 and '525 patents rotate multiple groups of bristle sets about the center of a bristle carrier. Specifically, multiple groups of bristle sets are disposed on a circular bristle carrier and that bristle carrier, typically one of several, is rotated about its own axis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567, herein incorporated by reference, describes a design combining the two previously noted strategies. A rotating bristle carrier is provided along with multiple individually rotatable bristle sets. Although this design likely provides many of the advantages associated with each of its predecessors, the cleaning efficacy of spinning bristle sets, alone, is somewhat limited.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Yet another design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,603, herein incorporated by reference. The '603 patent describes an assembly of &#x201c;staggered swing&#x201d; brushes. Apparently, the two bristle carriers move along a complex path within the plane of the toothbrush.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As will be appreciated, the present invention is directed to electric toothbrushes, including electric toothbrushes having replaceable brush head ends, replaceable bristle carriers and electric toothbrushes having multiple bristle carriers. In particular, the present invention is directed to an electric toothbrush with two bristle carriers, each of which is driven by an electric motor incorporated within the toothbrush body. As described in greater detail herein, it is contemplated that two or more electric motors could be utilized in the present invention toothbrush.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Specifically, the present invention can be used in conjunction with electric toothbrushes, brush heads, and bristle carriers that include shafts that rotate, oscillate, or reciprocate (as well as combinations thereof) to impart motion to the first and second bristle carriers. In addition, the present invention can be used in combination with electric toothbrushes, brush heads, and bristle carriers where the shaft is operatively connected to both the first and second bristle carriers or only one of the bristle carriers. In the latter instance, the bristle carriers are themselves interconnected so that a motion is imparted to the bristle carrier that is not directly coupled to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Before describing the various preferred embodiment toothbrushes and associated drive mechanisms, it is instructive to define the various types of motions referenced herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;angular motion&#x201d; refers to any angular displacement. &#x201c;Linear motion&#x201d; is movement along a straight or substantially straight, line or direction. &#x201c;Primarily linear motion&#x201d; is described below. &#x201c;Curvilinear motion&#x201d; is movement that is neither completely linear nor completely angular but is a combination of the two (e.g., curvilinear). These motions can be constant or periodic. Constant motion refers to motion that does not change direction or path (i.e., is unidirectional). Periodic motion refers to motion that reverses direction or path. Constant angular motion (i.e., motion that extends through 360 degrees or more) that is substantially in the form of a circle is referred to as rotary motion. Periodic angular motion is motion that extends through less than 360 degrees and is referred to as oscillating motion. Curvilinear motions can also be either constant (i.e., unidirectional) or periodic (i.e., reverses direction). Periodic linear motion is referred to as &#x201c;reciprocation&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The above-described motions can also occur along one or more axes of a bristle carrier. Accordingly, motion is described herein as being either one, two, or three dimensional motion depending upon the number of axial coordinates required to describe the position of a bristle carrier during its movement. The axes, X, Y, and Z, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. One dimensional motion is motion that can be described by a single coordinate (e.g., X, Y, or Z coordinates). Typically, only linear motion can be one dimensional. For example, periodic linear motion substantially along only the Y axis is one dimensional motion (referred to herein as a &#x201c;pulsing motion&#x201d;). Two dimensional motion is movement by a bristle carrier that requires two coordinates (e.g., X and Y coordinates) to describe the path of travel of the bristle carrier. Angular motion that occurs in a single plane is two dimensional motion. Three dimensional motion is movement by a bristle carrier that requires three coordinates (e.g., X, Y, and Z coordinates) to describe the path of travel of the bristle carrier. An example of three dimensional motion is movement by a bristle carrier in the path of a helix.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment toothbrush <b>2</b> in accordance with the present invention. The toothbrush <b>2</b> comprises an elongated body <b>10</b> having a handle <b>30</b>, a head <b>50</b>, and a neck <b>40</b> extending between the handle <b>30</b> and the head <b>50</b>. A switch <b>20</b> is provided or made accessible along the outer region of the body <b>10</b>. As will be appreciated, the switch <b>20</b> actuates an electrical motor contained within the body <b>10</b> of toothbrush <b>2</b>. The motor (not shown) and a drive mechanism as described herein (not shown) provide a powered drive for one or more bristle carriers disposed near a distal end of the toothbrush. Specifically, the toothbrush <b>2</b> further includes a first bristle carrier <b>60</b> and a second bristle carrier <b>70</b> located adjacent a distal-most end <b>52</b>. As described in greater detail herein, upon activation of the drive mechanism, the first and second bristle carriers undergo a particular combination of motions. The motions are best described in terms of the axes X, Y, and Z and the planes which contain these axes.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The X axis is generally referred to herein as the longitudinal axis and generally extends along a longitudinal or lengthwise dimension (as seen from the top planar view of the toothbrush) of the toothbrush head or the bristle carrier. The longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head or bristle carrier may coincide with the longitudinal axes of the toothbrush neck and/or handle, although it need not do so as for example where the toothbrush head is angled with respect to either the toothbrush neck or handle. For example, a longitudinal axis is an axis passing through the longest dimension of the toothbrush head. The Y axis is transverse to the X axis and generally bisects the toothbrush head into its left and right halves. The Z axis is orthogonal or perpendicular to the X and Y axes.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Plane X contains the X axis and is generally referred to herein as the plane of the toothbrush or the plane of the toothbrush head. This plane generally extends along the longitudinal dimension of the toothbrush or the toothbrush head. The Y plane contains the Y axis and extends through the toothbrush and is perpendicular to the X plane. The Y plane either bisects the toothbrush or is parallel to a plane that does. The Z plane is perpendicular to both the X plane and the Y plane.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Furthermore, it is useful to address the terminology used in describing the preferred embodiment toothbrushes, bristle carriers, and the various drive mechanisms. As used herein, the term &#x201c;forward&#x201d; refers to the direction from the handle to the head while the term &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; refers to the direction from the head to the handle. A longitudinal direction is a direction that generally corresponds to a longitudinal or X axis but which may not lie in the same plane as the axis. For example, the longitudinal axes of a shaft and a bristle carrier may not extend in the same plane but generally extend in the same direction from a top planar view. Similarly, a neck and head that are angled with respect to each other may not have longitudinal axes that extend in the same plane, but do have axes which extend in the same general longitudinal direction from a top planar view. Many of the preferred embodiment electric toothbrushes typically have an elongated head with a longitudinal axis passing through the longest dimension thereof. This axis typically extends in the same general direction as the longitudinal axes of the toothbrush neck and/or shaft. This axis is generally referred to as the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush. By the phrase &#x201c;same general direction,&#x201d; some angular deviation is contemplated between the axes. Various references are also made herein to the &#x201c;plane of the toothbrush.&#x201d; As will be understood, this is generally the plane within which extends the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">And, as described herein, the first bristle carrier is the bristle carrier that is located at the distal-most end of the toothbrush. The second bristle carrier is the next bristle carrier positioned alongside or proximate to the first bristle carrier and rearward therefrom. A third bristle carrier is proximate the second bristle carrier and is positioned rearward of the second bristle carrier. A fourth bristle carrier is rearward of the third and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Generally, the preferred embodiment toothbrushes according to the present invention comprise an elongated hollow body that retains an electrically powered motor and drive mechanism that is used to drive two or more moveable bristle carriers. The elongated hollow body also includes an interior chamber for containing one or more batteries for powering the motor. And, one or more switches are provided along the outer region of the body for activating the motor and drive mechanism. As will be appreciated, a removable end cap is provided to enclose the interior chamber and provide a seal against external agents for the components inside the toothbrush body. As described in detail herein, the preferred embodiment toothbrushes comprise two or more movable bristle carriers. Each of the bristle carriers undergoes particular types of motion and the resulting combinations of movements provide unique cleaning efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As noted, the preferred embodiment electric toothbrushes comprise a plurality of bristle carriers that are driven by an electric motor and drive mechanism incorporated in the toothbrush. Preferably, these toothbrushes utilize two bristle carriers, each undergoing motion different than the motion of the other bristle carrier. Specifically, there are numerous categories of combinations of movements of the two bristle carriers which are encompassed by the present invention. Each of these categories involves various specific types of combinations of movement as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A first category of combinations of movements of the two bristle carriers is that in which the first or distal-most bristle carrier moves in a linear fashion, and the second bristle carrier moves in a primarily linear fashion. Specifically, this category involves motion in which the first bristle carrier undergoes one dimensional periodic, i.e. repeated, linear movement in combination with two or three dimensional periodic primarily linear movement by the second bristle carrier. It will be appreciated that the reference to &#x201c;primarily linear&#x201d; refers to movement that is in two or three dimensions and not entirely linear in nature. Movement that is primarily linear is movement that is best characterized as non-linear movement, however movement that is substantially along a single axis, line or direction. That is, primarily linear motion is movement that is generally along a single line or direction. This motion may include deviation from the line or direction of movement, however such motion is substantially linear.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">This combination of movements may be further defined as involving one of the following specific types of movement by the first bristle carrier and one of the following specific types of movement by the second bristle carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The first bristle carrier may reciprocate along a single axis or line in the X plane of the toothbrush head or a plane that is generally parallel to the plane of the toothbrush head, and in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. Or, the first bristle carrier may reciprocate along a single axis or line in the X plane of the toothbrush head or a plane generally parallel to the plane of the toothbrush head, and in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head (and so the first bristle carrier moves in a &#x201c;side-to-side&#x201d; fashion). Alternately, the first bristle carrier may reciprocate along a single axis in the X plane of the toothbrush head or a plane generally parallel to the X plane of the toothbrush head, and in a direction other than parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. That is, the first bristle carrier may reciprocate along an axis that extends at an acute angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. Instead, the first bristle carrier may reciprocate along a single axis in a plane perpendicular to the X plane of the toothbrush head (and so, moving in an &#x201c;up and down&#x201d; or &#x201c;pulsing&#x201d; fashion). In other words, the first bristle carrier may move in a direction aligned with the Y axis of the toothbrush head. Yet another motion is that in which the first bristle carrier may reciprocate along a single axis in a plane other than one that is parallel or perpendicular to the X plane of the toothbrush head. All of these motions of the first bristle carrier are one dimensional or linear.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The second bristle carrier may undergo repeated motion that is primarily linear within the X plane of the toothbrush head or a plane generally parallel to the X plane of the toothbrush head. Or, the second bristle carrier may undergo repeated motion that is primarily linear and in a plane that is perpendicular to the X plane of the toothbrush head (and so, the second bristle carrier would resemble a &#x201c;pulsing&#x201d; type motion). Or, the second bristle carrier may undergo repeated motion that is primarily linear in a plane other than one that is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the toothbrush head. Alternatively, the second bristle carrier may undergo repeated motion that is primarily linear and non-planar (hence, the designation that motion of the second bristle carrier is in three dimensions). This motion of the second bristle carrier, although non-planar, can be characterized by primarily extending within a plane that is: (i) within the plane of the toothbrush head or a plane that is generally parallel to the plane of the toothbrush head; (ii) perpendicular to the plane of the toothbrush head; or (iii) different than either the plane of the toothbrush head or a plane perpendicular thereto.</p>

The shaft <b>2420</b> has a distal end <b>2422</b> to which is engaged a screw member <b>2430</b>. The screw member <b>2430</b> defines a channel <b>2432</b>. The second bristle carrier <b>2470</b> includes a base <b>2472</b> and a plate <b>2474</b>. The base is moveably disposed on the head and positionable with respect to the head. Extending downwardly from the plate <b>2474</b> is a guide member <b>2476</b>. It will be understood that the base may be of a unitary construction and not utilize a separate plate component. That is, the base itself may provide a downwardly extending guide member. The guide member <b>2476</b> extends into the channel <b>2432</b> defined by the screw member <b>2430</b>. The head <b>2450</b> includes an inclined ramp surface <b>2456</b> generally underneath the second bristle carrier <b>2470</b> and further defines a guide channel or elongated aperture <b>2454</b>. During operation, the rotating or oscillating shaft <b>2420</b> imparts a similar motion to the screw member <b>2430</b>. That, in turn, causes linear displacement of the plate <b>2474</b> and the base <b>2472</b> of the second bristle carrier <b>2470</b>. A vertical component is imparted to this motion from the inclined ramp surface <b>2456</b> defined along the head <b>2450</b>.

That motion is of the second bristle carrier undergoing repeated motion that is primarily linear in a plane other than one that is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the toothbrush head.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">A mechanism for achieving the motion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> is described later herein. That motion is of the second bristle carrier undergoing three dimensional motion.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Specifically, the preferred structure and arrangement of the moveable and powered bristle carriers is as follows. A second bristle carrier is disposed adjacent the first bristle carrier. While it is desirable to locate the second bristle carrier directly adjacent the first bristle carrier, it is contemplated that a gap may be provided between the first and second bristle carriers. In addition, the gap between the first and second bristle carriers might be filled with stationary bristles which are embedded in a fixed or stationary third bristle carrier (not shown) which forms part of the toothbrush end. Further, while the first bristle carrier has been described as adjacent the distal end of the toothbrush, it is contemplated that the second bristle carrier might be disposed adjacent the distal end of the toothbrush and driven in the same manner as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">While the embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated for simplicity with bristles which extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and the surface of the bristle carriers, it is contemplated that the bristles might be arranged differently to complement or further enhance the motions of the first and/or second bristle carriers. That is, some or all of the bristles might extend in a direction which forms an acute angle to a surface of the bristle carrier and extend in a direction toward or away from the handle. In another embodiment, some of the bristles might extend outwardly away from the head, in another direction, again forming an acute angle with respect to the surface of the bristle carrier. Massaging bristles or bristles of varying height might also be used, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 330,286, Des. 434,563, the substances of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other preferred bristle arrangements suitable for use include those arrangements described in whole or part in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,006,394; 4,081,876; 5,046,213; 5,335,389; 5,392,483; 5,446,940; 4,894,880; and international publication no. WO 99/23910; the substances of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">A variety of drive mechanisms may be utilized in the preferred embodiment toothbrushes described herein. As noted, drive mechanisms that provide a powered rotating output or a reciprocating or oscillating output are preferred. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,617,603; 5,850,603; 5,974,615; 6,032,313; 5,504,959; 5,524,312; 5,625,916; 5,732,432; 5,070,567; 5,170,525; 5,416,942; 3,588,936; 5,867,856; and 4,397,055, the substances of which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose other motor and rotating or oscillating shaft arrangements that might be suitable. Furthermore, the drive mechanisms disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 10/027,594, filed Dec. 21, 2001; and U.S. Ser. No. 09/993,167, filed Nov. 6, 2001, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used. Additionally, any or all of the aspects of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,617,601 and 5,435,032, both of which are hereby incorporated herein, may be utilized in the toothbrushes described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">A preferred mechanism for imparting a pulsing type motion, or referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a motion in the Y plane, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>. This mechanism converts a rotary motion, such as from an output of an electric motor, to a reciprocating linear or substantially linear motion in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the toothbrush head. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a partial view of a preferred embodiment toothbrush F is shown. These figures illustrate a first bristle carrier <b>660</b> and a second bristle carrier <b>670</b> disposed along a head <b>650</b> proximate a neck <b>640</b>. Extending within the neck <b>640</b> is a portion of a drive mechanism including a rotating shaft <b>602</b>. It will be appreciated that the shaft <b>602</b> is powered or driven by an electric motor (not shown) disposed in the body or handle of the toothbrush. The drive mechanism also includes a crank portion <b>606</b> that is offset from the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>602</b>. The shaft <b>602</b> is rotatably supported at the distal end of the toothbrush F by a support <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">As will be appreciated, either or both of the first or second bristle carriers <b>660</b> and <b>670</b> may be driven by the mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>. However, for purposes of the present discussion, these figures depict only the first bristle carrier <b>660</b> being driven. Provided along the base or underside of the bristle carrier <b>660</b> is a plate <b>610</b>. The plate <b>610</b> is connected to the crank portion <b>606</b> by a linkage member <b>608</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates the mechanism in one position in which the first bristle carrier <b>660</b> is urged outward and generally away from the head <b>650</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates another position in which the bristle carrier <b>660</b> is drawn towards or partially retracted into the head <b>650</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C and 7D</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views detailing the mechanism and its positions in relation to the bristle carrier <b>660</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the head <b>650</b> taken along line <b>7</b>C-<b>7</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates the orientation of the crank portion <b>606</b> and base <b>610</b> when the first bristle carrier <b>660</b> is extended outward from the head <b>650</b> of the toothbrush F. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> is also a cross-sectional view however, taken along the line <b>7</b>D-<b>7</b>D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates the orientation of the crank portion <b>606</b> and base <b>610</b> when the bristle carrier <b>660</b> is drawn towards the head <b>650</b>. It may be desirable to provide a guide member <b>648</b> that extends alongside the plate <b>610</b> to provide a channel within which the plate <b>610</b> and bristle carrier <b>660</b> may reciprocate as shaft <b>602</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Another preferred mechanism for imparting motion to one or more bristle carriers is described in provisional application Ser. No. 60/361,625, filed Mar. 4, 2002, herein incorporated by reference. That mechanism imparts a &#x201c;side-to-side&#x201d; motion to a bristle carrier. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such motion causes either of both of the bristle carriers <b>60</b> and <b>70</b> to reciprocate within the plane of the toothbrush head, e.g. within the X plane, or within a plane parallel thereto, and in a direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Specifically, a representative drive mechanism to achieve a &#x201c;side-to-side&#x201d; motion is as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a preferred embodiment toothbrush G is illustrated. A first bristle carrier <b>760</b> is movably mounted in slots <b>702</b> in a bristle carrier <b>750</b> and driven in a reciprocating or translating, transverse motion within the slots <b>702</b> by a cam <b>755</b> included on a driving shaft <b>745</b>. The cam <b>755</b> can comprise an appropriately shaped bead placed over or molded and fixedly secured to the shaft <b>745</b>. For example, the bead is shaped as an eccentric cam. Alternatively, the cam profile may utilize one or more rectilinear, curvilinear or other types of bends. A first cam follower <b>734</b> and a second cam follower <b>736</b> each extend from a bottom surface of the first bristle carrier <b>760</b>. The cam followers are, for example, offset from the longitudinal axis L of the first bristle carrier and straddle or capture the cam <b>755</b>. As the motor (not shown) rotates the shaft <b>745</b> in accordance with arrow C, the cam <b>755</b> contacts a surface <b>744</b> of the first cam follower <b>734</b> and drives the first cam follower <b>734</b>, and therefore, the first bristle carrier <b>760</b> away from a first side <b>751</b> and toward a second side <b>753</b> of the bristle carrier <b>750</b> along a transverse axis <b>782</b> of the first bristle carrier <b>760</b>. As the shaft <b>745</b> continues to rotate, the cam <b>755</b> becomes disengaged with the first cam follower <b>734</b>. The cam <b>755</b> then contacts a surface <b>746</b> of the second cam follower <b>736</b> and drives the second cam follower <b>736</b>, and therefore, the first bristle carrier <b>760</b> toward the first side <b>751</b> and away from the second side <b>753</b> of the bristle carrier <b>750</b>. A clearance <b>765</b> is provided between the first and second bristle carriers <b>760</b>, <b>770</b> to accommodate the spacing requirements of this motion. As this back and forth or &#x201c;side-to-side&#x201d; motion is repeated (as the shaft <b>745</b> continues to rotate), a sweeping motion is provided that provides enhanced cleaning action to the teeth in the direction of arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, in another version of the toothbrush G, referred to herein as toothbrush H, the second bristle carrier <b>870</b> is movably mounted in slots <b>802</b> in the bristle carrier <b>850</b> and separately driven in a reciprocating or translating, transverse motion within the slots <b>802</b> by a cam <b>806</b> included on a driving shaft <b>808</b>. The cam <b>806</b> can comprise an appropriately shaped bead placed over or molded and fixedly secured to the shaft <b>808</b> as in the previously described embodiment for toothbrush G. First <b>810</b> and second <b>812</b> cam followers depend from a bottom surface of the second bristle carrier <b>870</b>. The cam followers are, for example, offset from the longitudinal axis L of the second bristle carrier <b>870</b> and straddle or capture the cam <b>806</b>. As the motor (not shown) rotates the shaft <b>808</b>, the cam <b>806</b> comes into contact with a surface <b>814</b> of the first cam follower <b>810</b> and drives the first cam follower <b>810</b>, and therefore, the second bristle carrier <b>870</b> away from a first side <b>820</b> and toward a second side <b>826</b> along an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L. As the shaft <b>808</b> continues to rotate, the cam <b>806</b> becomes disengaged with the first cam follower <b>810</b>. The cam <b>806</b> then comes into contact with a surface <b>816</b> of the second cam follower <b>812</b> and drives the second cam follower <b>812</b>, and therefore, the second bristle carrier <b>870</b> toward the first side <b>820</b> and away from the second side <b>826</b> of the bristle carrier portion <b>850</b>. As this back and forth or side-to-side motion is repeated (as the shaft <b>808</b> continues to rotate), the desired sweeping motion in the direction of arrow B is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">As previously noted, the first bristle carrier may undergo movement extending in three dimensions. Specifically, this movement is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D</figref>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>6</b>A. And, the second bristle carrier may undergo three dimensional movement, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I</figref>, <b>3</b>H, <b>4</b>E, <b>5</b>G, and <b>6</b>E. Several of the various mechanisms described herein may be modified to impart such motion to a bristle carrier. For example, a brush head such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A-20D</figref> having internal guide members <b>3054</b> that define a camming aperture <b>3056</b> could be provided with an upwardly directed elongated aperture defined in the brush head such as aperture <b>1554</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> for example. A bristle carrier undergoing repeated motion along or through these apertures would be non-planar and three dimensional. The exact path desired for the bristle carrier could be obtained by appropriate selection of the shape and orientation of each of the apertures, i.e. the upwardly directed aperture defined along an outer surface of the brush head and a camming aperture defined within the interior of the brush head. It is also contemplated that other components or aspects of mechanisms and tooth brushes described herein could be combined to provide a mechanism or drive train adapted to impart three dimensional motion to a bristle carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21C</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment toothbrush AD comprising a body <b>3110</b> having a neck <b>3140</b> and a head <b>3150</b>, which generally houses a reciprocating drive shaft <b>3124</b>. Disposed on the head <b>3150</b> is a first bristle carrier <b>3160</b>, proximate an end <b>3152</b> of the head <b>3150</b>, and a second bristle carrier <b>3170</b>. The first bristle carrier <b>3160</b> is disposed on a movable base <b>3162</b> which includes an extension member <b>3174</b> extending within a hollow region defined within the head <b>3150</b>. The member <b>3174</b> includes a plurality of laterally extending guides <b>3176</b> that are disposed in a camming aperture <b>3156</b> defined within the hollow interior of the head <b>3150</b>. The extension member <b>3174</b> is engaged to a distal end <b>3126</b> of the drive shaft <b>3124</b> by a linkage assembly <b>3180</b>. Upon reciprocation of the shaft <b>3124</b>, the linkage assembly <b>3180</b>, extension member <b>3174</b>, base <b>3162</b>, and first bristle carrier <b>3160</b> are displaced. The path of motion of the first bristle carrier <b>3160</b> is three dimensional.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22C</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment toothbrush AE comprising a body <b>3210</b> having a neck <b>3240</b> and a head <b>3250</b> with a distal-most end <b>3252</b>. The body <b>3210</b> generally encloses a reciprocating drive shaft <b>3224</b>. Disposed on the head <b>3250</b> is a first bristle carrier <b>3260</b> and a second bristle carrier <b>3270</b>. Specifically, the second bristle carrier <b>3270</b> is disposed on a movable base <b>3272</b> that includes an arm <b>3278</b> that extends into a hollow interior region of the body <b>3210</b>, neck <b>3240</b>, or head <b>3250</b>. The arm <b>3278</b> includes one or more laterally extending guide members <b>3276</b> that are disposed in and engaged by one or more camming apertures <b>3256</b> provided within the hollow interior noted. The arm <b>3278</b> of the base <b>3272</b> is engaged to a distal end <b>3226</b> of the drive shaft <b>3224</b> by a linkage assembly <b>3280</b> as previously described herein. Preferably, the head <b>3250</b> defines one or more elongated apertures <b>3215</b> defined along its outer surface. Portions of the base <b>3272</b>, such as the arm <b>3278</b>, preferably extend through the apertures <b>3215</b>. Upon reciprocation of the shaft <b>3224</b>, the linkage assembly <b>3280</b>, the arm <b>3278</b>, the base <b>3272</b>, and the second bristle carrier <b>3270</b> are displaced. Most preferably, the movement of the second bristle carrier <b>3270</b> is governed by the shape and orientation of the apertures <b>3256</b> and <b>3215</b>. The resulting motion of the second bristle carrier is three dimensional.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">A variety of different mechanisms may be used to provide the noted motions described herein. These mechanisms may utilize either a rotating or oscillating shaft or a linearly reciprocating shaft as a power source. Generally, the various repeating periodic motions are achieved by arrangements of pivoting members and linkage assemblies that have certain predetermined regions of freedom. Accordingly, rotating or reciprocating motion from a powered shaft may be translated to a linear, primarily linear, curvilinear, or a three dimensional motion by particular selection and configuration of components forming the drive mechanism. Furthermore, guide channels may be provided along or within the head or region of the toothbrush body near the bristle carrier(s) for assisting or guiding the movement of the bristle carrier(s).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Additionally, it will be appreciated that any of the mechanisms or drive trains described or illustrated herein may be combined with any of the other mechanisms or drive trains noted herein. And, portions of any of these mechanisms may be combined with portions of any other mechanism noted herein. It is also contemplated that a toothbrush as described herein may employ two of the drive trains noted herein, such that each drive train powers a particular bristle carrier. Accordingly, two electrical motors could also be utilized, one for each drive train.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments. Modifications and alternations will occur to others upon reading and understanding this specification. For example, while certain cams have been described as comprising bends in a shaft and other cams have been described as including appropriately shaped beads secured to a shaft, the cams are not limited to the suggested form. Indeed, bends may be substituted for beads and beads may be substituted for bends and other shapes, sizes, and configurations can be implemented. Furthermore, it is contemplated that any of the features or aspects of any of the toothbrushes A-AE may be combined with or utilized in conjunction with any of the other features or aspects of any of the toothbrushes A-AE It is intended that all such modifications and alternations are included insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or equivalents thereof.</p>
