<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to ornamental devices, and more particularly, to a device for securing ornamentation to personal items.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is often desirable and fun for people to place ornamental elements on personal items such as clothing, accessories and housewares. One conventional way to accomplish this, is through the use of decorative pins. It is not always possible or desirable, however, to place a pin through a selected personal item. Other conventional methods include stitching or the use of adhesives, both of which have associated drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art systems also exist for securing ornamentation to an item through hook and loop fasteners, such as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,776,043 and 5,359,734.Other conventional systems teach to secure plates of ferrous material to the underside of a garment or in a pocket stitched within a garment, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,963.Such systems have several shortcomings, including being expensive to manufacture, being unattractive, and having low stability such that the magnetic emblem of the prior art may be easily knocked from the personal item.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Applicant therefore believes that it is possible and desirable to provide an improved system for securing ornamentation to a personal item. The present invention provides such a system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a system for securing an ornamental element to a personal item. As used throughout, &#x201c;personal item&#x201d; is meant as a broad term, to encompass such things as an article of clothing, purse, backpack, belt, etc., as well as all manner of housewares, toys, jewelry and items for pets. These potential uses are presented merely by way of example, and the invention is not limited to such uses.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, an ornamental device includes a first member adapted to be coupled to a personal item. While this may be accomplished in any known available way, in one embodiment, the first member is a rivet that is coupled to a personal item in a known manner. Alternatively, the first member is secured to a selected surface, for example by an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first member is provided with a first end having a sidewall. A second member is releasably engagable with the first member, and is provided with a recess that receives the first end of the first member when the first and second members are engaged. The second member is further provided with a flange that contacts the sidewall of the first member substantially along a width of the sidewall when the first and second members are engaged. The first and second members are magnetically coupled. More particularly, one of the first and second members includes a magnetic element, and the other of the first and second members is attractable to a magnet. It will be understood that this may be accomplished through use of a magnet and a ferrous element, or through the use of two magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a lens is coupled to an upper region of the second member and an ornamental element is provided beneath the lens. In one embodiment, the lens is removably secured to the second member, allowing a user to replace the ornamentation visible through the lens. In other embodiments, the lens is fixed or is eliminated. In these and other embodiments, an upper region of the second member may be provided directly with ornamentation. It will be understood that &#x201c;ornamentation&#x201d; as used throughout is a broad, encompassing term, and may take any form, including, but not limited to, the use of jewels, glass, metal working, enamel, embroidery, plastic, etc., and may be decorative or serve an identification function.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides many benefits over prior art systems for securing ornamentation to a personal item. More particularly, by securing an ornamental member magnetically to a rivet that is received within a recess of the ornamental member, and by ensuring that a flange of the ornamental member extends along a sidewall of the rivet, lateral stability is provided between the two pieces, further securing the ornamental element to the rivet. Given that rivets are conventional in appearance and inexpensive to install, a user may choose to mount a variety of first members, or rivets, to a personal item and then secure one or more ornamental second members as desired. As discussed above, rather than merely being magnetically attracted, the arrangement of the flange secured over the width of the rivet provides lateral stability, which helps prevent the ornamental item from being accidentally dislodged from the first member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, it is fashionably acceptable to have rivets on personal items. Therefore, even if the user chooses to not use the decorative second members, it will be acceptable to have the first members provided on the personal item alone, unlike prior art systems where failure to have the selected indicia attached to the personal item may result in an exposed metal disc. The present system is therefore more secure, cost-effective, and fashionably acceptable.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an ornamentation device <b>10</b> provided in accordance with the present invention includes a first member <b>11</b> and a second member <b>14</b>. The first member <b>11</b> is provided with a first end <b>12</b> having a sidewall <b>13</b>. The first member <b>11</b> is adapted to be coupled to any selected personal item. While this may be accomplished in any known manner, in one embodiment, the first member includes a shaft <b>28</b> and a backer <b>29</b>. Similar to the installation of a rivet, a conventional tool is used to force the post <b>33</b> of backer <b>29</b> through a selected surface of a personal item into the hollow shaft <b>28</b> of the first member <b>11</b>, thereby securing the first member <b>11</b> at a selected location on a personal item, with the first end <b>12</b> positioned on one side of a surface of the personal item and the backer <b>29</b> positioned on an opposite side of the surface of the personal item.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the second member <b>14</b> is provided with a recess <b>15</b> that is adapted to receive the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b> when the first and second members <b>11</b>, <b>14</b> are engaged. Furthermore, the recess <b>15</b> is defined by inner annular wall <b>25</b> which forms flange <b>16</b>, the depth of the recess <b>15</b> being selected to ensure that flange <b>16</b> contacts the sidewall <b>13</b> of the first member <b>11</b> substantially along a width <b>17</b> of the sidewall when the first and second members are engaged. In addition to the interference fit provided between the recess <b>15</b> and the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b>, the first and second members <b>11</b>, <b>14</b> are magnetically attracted to each other. More particularly, one of the first and second members is provided with a magnetic element and the other of the first and second members is attractable by a magnet. In one embodiment, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second member <b>14</b> is provided with an annular cavity <b>24</b> bounded by the inner annular wall <b>25</b>, and a magnet <b>18</b> is positioned within the annular cavity <b>24</b>. A ferrous disc <b>19</b> is positioned in the first end <b>12</b> of the first member. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first member <b>11</b> may be made of a ferrous material, eliminating the need for a ferrous disc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment of the invention, a lens <b>20</b> is coupled to an upper region of the second member <b>14</b>, and an ornamental element <b>21</b> is positioned beneath the lens <b>20</b> to be visible through the lens. In one embodiment, the lens is removably secured to the second member, thereby allowing a user to change the ornamental element positioned within the second member <b>14</b>. Alternatively, an upper surface of the second member <b>14</b> may be provided directly with ornamentation, and the second member may or may not include lens <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an alternative embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a depression <b>22</b> is provided in the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b>. A male member <b>23</b> extends downward from an upper surface of recess <b>15</b> in the second member <b>14</b>, such that when the first and second members are engaged, the male member <b>23</b> is received within the depression <b>22</b> of the first member <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the male member <b>23</b> is a magnet, and the first member <b>11</b> is made of a ferrous material. Similar to previous embodiments, the second member <b>14</b> has a flange <b>16</b> that extends substantially along the width of the sidewall <b>13</b> of the first member <b>11</b>. In this manner, the first and second members <b>11</b>, <b>14</b>, are magnetically coupled, and the interface between flange <b>16</b> and sidewall <b>13</b> provides lateral stability, thereby further securing the first and second members together. Alternatively, flange <b>16</b> of the second member <b>14</b> may be omitted. As such, lateral stability is provided by the male member <b>23</b> being received within depression <b>22</b> and being encircled by sidewall <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a male member <b>38</b> provided in the second member <b>14</b> rests against an upper surface of the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b>, thereby providing a small gap between magnet <b>18</b> and the ferrous first member <b>11</b>, thereby improving the strength of the magnetic coupling. Again though, similar to the embodiments discussed above, the second member <b>14</b> is provided with a flange <b>16</b> that defines a recess <b>15</b>, into which is received the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b>. As such, the first and second members <b>11</b>, <b>14</b> are magnetically coupled, and the interface between flange <b>16</b> and sidewall <b>13</b> provides lateral stability, thereby further securing the first and second members together.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be understood that although the illustrated embodiments show a magnet provided in the second member and the first member being attractable by a magnet, this arrangement may be reversed, in that the first member may have a magnet, and the second member may be attractable by a magnet. While this may be accomplished through use of a magnet and a ferrous material, it may also be accomplished through the use of two magnets having reverse polarity. By providing a magnet in the second member, however, the second member <b>14</b> may be placed on another surface, for example a refrigerator, to display the ornamental element <b>21</b>. For purposes of display, it may also be desirable to have a board to which multiple second members are attachable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-6C</figref>, a spacer <b>26</b> is coupled to a plurality of first members <b>11</b>, holding the first members in fixed positions relative to each other. A second member <b>27</b> provided with a plurality of recesses <b>30</b> is releasably couplable to the first members, as described above. On a side opposite to recesses <b>30</b>, an upper region <b>31</b> of the second member <b>27</b> is provided with any desired ornamentation <b>32</b>. Such an arrangement may be desirable, for example, when the desired ornamentation is elongated, for example being in the form of a rectangle or oval. In an alternative embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, a plurality of bosses <b>34</b> forming recesses <b>30</b>, are adhered to the backside of a second member <b>35</b>, which in one embodiment, is flexible, for example, by being made of fabric or plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be understood that while the first member <b>11</b> of the present invention may be secured to a selected personal item as conventional rivets are attached to personal items, any available method may be used to secure the first member <b>11</b> to a personal item at a selected location. Furthermore, the first member <b>11</b> does not need to extend through a personal item, but rather, could be secured to an upper surface of a personal item. For example, a first member <b>11</b> could be secured to a hard surface, such as a ceramic or metal surface, for example by an adhesive, thereby allowing decorative second members to be attached to personal items such as plates or coffee mugs. If a first member <b>11</b> is attached in this way to a surface, the shaft <b>28</b> and backer <b>29</b> may be eliminated, such that a first end <b>12</b> having a sidewall <b>13</b> effectively forming a disc <b>37</b>, is coupled directed to a selected surface. For purposes of illustration, a plurality of discs <b>37</b> are shown coupled to a mug <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It will be understood, however, that such discs may be coupled to any selected hard surface. The discs <b>37</b> are in effect the first end <b>12</b> of the first member <b>11</b> shown throughout the embodiments described above, and may be ferrous or magnetic and may couple with any of the embodiments described above for the various second members.</p>
