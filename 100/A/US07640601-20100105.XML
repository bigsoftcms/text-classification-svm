<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the sports caps and more particularly to the design of the visor of a sports cap that allows installation of decorative items and a golf counter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To modern people, enjoying the sunlight and the stunning beauty of the lush green fields is one of the best ways to release stress. Therefore, outdoor sports games are widely participated. In recent years, with the prosperity of the society and the fast growing of the industries and business, the sports population has significantly increased. Whether male or female, old or young, people enjoy sports and encourage their friends and relatives to join.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When playing an outdoor sports game in the wild open field, the body is exposed to the radiation of the sunlight. Therefore, it is necessary to wear a cap, protecting the head and the eyes from the radiation of the sunlight. Under the protection of the cap, the user can enjoy the sports game more comfortably.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a regular sports cap is simply a covering with a visor for protecting the user's head and eyes from the radiation of the sunlight. Modern people's requirements for products are critical. In addition to functions, people do care about quality, beauty, novelty and unique characteristic. To flourish in the market, a sports cap manufacturer needs to create unique and innovative sports caps with added features to attract consumers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. Therefore one object of the present invention is to provide a sports cap that allows installation of decorative items and a detachable golf counter in the visor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, the sports cap comprises a crown and a visor extending outward from the bottom edge of the crown. The visor comprises an intermediate support layer that supports the visor in shape and has multiple recesses on the top side, a top layer covering the intermediate support layer, a positioning block fitted into one recess of the intermediate support layer, the positioning block with a center insertion hole for receiving a stem of a decorative item, a bottom layer covering the bottom side of the intermediate support layer opposite to the top layer, and a lining layer sandwiched between the intermediate support layer and the bottom layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, a hold down member is fastened to one recess of the intermediate support layer to hold the positioning block in place. The hold down member has a center through hole axially aligned with the center insertion hole of the positioning block, a group of first mounting legs for securing the positioning block, and a group of second mounting legs for fastening to the associated recess of the intermediate support layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present invention, a golf counter can be attached to the decorative item at the visor and secured thereto by means of magnetic force.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a sports cap <b>1</b> is shown comprising a crown <b>11</b> for covering the user's head and a visor <b>12</b> extending outward from a part of the crown <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The visor <b>12</b> is comprised of a top layer <b>121</b>, an intermediate support layer <b>122</b> and a bottom layer <b>123</b>. The intermediate support layer <b>122</b> is sandwiched between the top layer <b>121</b> and the bottom layer <b>123</b> to support the visor <b>12</b> in shape, having multiple recesses <b>1222</b> on the top side and spaced from one another at a distance, a positioning hole <b>1223</b> in each recess <b>122</b>, and a positioning block <b>14</b> fitted into each recess <b>1222</b>. The positioning block <b>14</b> has a center insertion hole <b>141</b> axially aligned with the positioning hole <b>1223</b> in the associated recess <b>1222</b>, and is adapted to attract a decorative item <b>2</b> by means of magnetic attraction, i.e., the decorative item <b>2</b> and the positioning block <b>14</b> are made out of a ferrous or magnetic material. The decorative item <b>2</b> comprises a head <b>21</b> and at least one stem <b>22</b> extended from the bottom side of the head <b>21</b>. The head <b>21</b> can be made having a circular or rectangular profile, or the geographical shape of a country, or the shape of a character. The stem <b>22</b> according to this embodiment is a round rod. Further, the stem <b>22</b> is pierced through the top layer <b>121</b> and then fitted into the center insertion hole <b>141</b> of the positioning block <b>14</b> and the positioning hole <b>1223</b> in the associated recess <b>1222</b> to secure the decorative item <b>2</b> to the visor <b>12</b>, keeping the head <b>21</b> supported on the top side of the top layer <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are an exploded view of a sports cap and an enlarged view of a hold down member in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. According to this embodiment, a hold down member <b>15</b> is mounted in one recess <b>1222</b> of the intermediate support layer <b>122</b> to hold down the positioning block <b>14</b>. The hold down member <b>15</b> has a center through hole <b>151</b> for the passing of the stem <b>22</b> of the decorative item <b>2</b>, a group of first mounting legs <b>152</b> adapted to secure the positioning block <b>14</b>, and a group of second mounting legs <b>153</b> for fastening to the recess <b>1222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the decorative item <b>2</b> can be made out of a magnetic material so that a golf counter <b>3</b> can be attached to the head <b>21</b> of the decorative item <b>2</b> and secured thereto by means of magnetic attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded view of a sports cap in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. According to this embodiment, the visor <b>12</b> is comprised of a top layer <b>121</b>, an intermediate support layer <b>122</b>, a lining layer <b>1221</b> and a bottom layer <b>123</b>. The intermediate support layer <b>122</b> is sandwiched between the top layer <b>121</b> and the bottom layer <b>123</b> to support the visor <b>12</b> in shape, having multiple recesses <b>1222</b> on the top side and a positioning block <b>14</b> fitted into each recess <b>1222</b>. The positioning block <b>14</b> has a center insertion hole <b>141</b>. The lining layer <b>1221</b> is bonded to the bottom side of the intermediate support layer <b>122</b> and sandwiched between the intermediate support layer <b>122</b> and the bottom layer <b>123</b>, having a group of positioning holes <b>1223</b> axially aligned with the center insertion hole <b>141</b> of the positioning block <b>14</b> in the associating recess <b>1222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, the invention provides a sports cap that has the following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">1. The visor <b>12</b> of the sports cap <b>1</b> allows for installation of decorative items <b>2</b> securely. The decorative items <b>2</b> decorate the visor <b>12</b> of the sports cap <b>1</b>. Further, a golf counter <b>3</b> can be secured to one decorative item <b>2</b> at the visor <b>12</b> of the sports cap <b>1</b> by means of magnetic attraction, adding an additional function to the sports cap <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">2. By means of a series of designs on the visor <b>12</b>, the invention provides different models of sports caps to satisfy different needs from different users.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the decorative item can be made having a head and multiple spring legs that can be inserted through the visor and then bent into shape to secure the head to the visor. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
