<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to a quick connect coupling assembly including a plurality of locking elements each having a locking member structured and disposed to be maintained in an outwardly extending orientation by a biasing mechanism. The biasing mechanism may comprise magnetic biasing elements attached to each oppositely disposed locking element, the magnetic biasing elements structured to create a repulsive magnetic force between one another, thereby forcing the corresponding locking member into the outwardly extending orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is widely known that there are millions of dog owners in this country as well as other countries throughout the world. Dogs comprise one of the most popular types of animals for household pets. Of course, dogs are extremely popular animals for other than simple companionship. Other uses of dogs include working dogs and show dogs. In turn, working dogs may be classified as dogs utilized for police enforcement purposes, military activities, dogs trained for hunting and also dogs specifically trained to aid those individuals who are visually impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regardless of the above classifications, the care and maintenance of dogs require the use of numerous auxiliary or supplementary items. Among the most popular is the dog leash or tethering assembly wherein dogs are retained and/or restricted for purposes of control when not contained by fences in a yard or like area. Moreover, similar type leash assemblies are also useful on a variety of different animals including pets and farm animals, such as horses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is also well recognized that leash structures, collars, harnesses, etc., are available in numerous and varying designs intended to control an animal for different purposes. Prior art structures exist which comprise leash and collar combinations specifically structured such that the length of a lead of the leash assembly is selectively variable so that the dog or animal being tethered may enjoy a greater range of movement and freedom when the surrounding area allows. Alternately, the tethered animal may be restrained, by shortening the length of the extendable lead in areas which do not allow the free roaming of the dog. Other prior art leash or tethering assemblies are specifically designed to allow control and retention of the dog or other animal while significantly reducing or eliminating the tangling of the dog in the retaining harness and/or about an anchoring structure to which the animal is tethered.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An area which is not currently addressed by leash and retaining harness assemblies is the ability to quickly and easily connect an animal to the leash assembly and to permit release of the animal from a spaced distance from the animal, such as a remote location. In the majority of conventional or known leash assemblies, it is necessary for a handler to manipulate a coupling structure utilizing both hands, wherein the coupling structure serves to connect the distal end of the lead to the collar or retaining harness mounted on the animal. This generally involves direct handling or manipulation of any one of a large variety of such coupling structures. Attachment of the animal can be extremely difficult, particularly when the dog or animal being tethered is overly frisky or otherwise in an excited state. Also, in accomplishing either attachment or detachment of the lead from the collar or like harness particular problems are encountered by the elderly or by those who are visually or otherwise physically challenged.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to the above, the handling of larger animals, such as horses and/or working dogs of the type trained to conduct police enforcement and/or military activities, requires that the animal be kept under control by the handler. However, in cases of emergency, it is equally important that the animal be released or detached from his controlling lead as quickly as possible as it could be dangerous for the animal to begin running while dragging the lead or any part of the leash assembly. Conversely, if the animal is loose, it may be necessary to quickly re-harness the animal in order to restrain its movement in a hazardous situation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further problem is encountered in the handling, and in particular, the transportation, of horses. Specifically, when a horse is being confined in a trailer they often become anxious and/or excited. Combined with the tight space limitations of most trailers, the excited condition of the animal presents a dangerous situation for the handler who must enter the trailer to either attach or release the animal from the trailer. Thus, it would be advantageous and potentially life saving for both the animal and the handler to provide a means to remotely release a horse that is attached to a trailer. At a minimum, it would be advantageous to provide a remote, emergency release activation mechanism on an exterior portion of the trailer, such that the animal could be released without requiring the handler to enter the trailer, which may cause the animal to become even more anxious or excited.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another area which the prior or related art does not address is related to facilitating adjustment of the length of the lead by the handler utilizing a retractable leash assembly. In particular, although the prior art devices allow the length of the lead, and thus, the distance between the animal and the handler, or a fixed tethering location, to be adjusted, they do not provide a means to align the lead for smooth and easy retraction or release of the lead regardless of the relative position of the animal to the handler or the tethering location. More specifically, when the lead is extended a long distance, the angle formed between the lead to the handler is quite different than the angle formed when the animal is in close proximity. Thus, the handler is forced to constantly adjust the position of the device relative to the animal to prevent binding of the lead with the housing of the device during retraction or release of the lead to or from the handle, respectively. Additionally, movement of the animal to the left or right of the handler or tethering location may also increase the potential for binding of the lead upon retraction or release of the lead into or from the housing of the assembly. Nor does the prior leash and/or tethering assembly art provide a means to lock the lead in position relative to the assembly upon detection of a specific release velocity or sudden acceleration of the lead from the housing, as may occur when an animal becomes excited or angry and bolts from the handler or the tethering location.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, there is a recognized need in this area for a leash or tethering assembly including a quick connect coupling assembly having coupling components structured to easily align into position for connection by a handler with a single hand. It would also be preferable for such an assembly to allow connection and release from an animal by the handler while in an upright position, thereby eliminating the need for the handler to bend over, such as may be inconvenient for elderly or infirm handlers. Further, such a preferred leash or tethering assembly should be structured to permit quick and effective detachment or release of the animal via an activation assembly located a spaced distance from the animal and the coupling component serving to connect the animal harness to the lead. Preferably, such an activation assembly may utilize mechanical, electrical, and/or magnetic forces to facilitate the alignment and interconnection of the coupling components. Further, it would be beneficial for the activation assembly to utilize mechanical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, fiber optic, computer generated, and/or remote voice activated signals to effect the release of the coupling components of the leash assembly from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would further be beneficial to provide a leash assembly including wherein the activation assembly includes a lead aligning mechanism structured to maintain the lead in position relative to the housing of the activation assembly as the lead is retracted and/or released into or from the housing, respectively, to minimize binding of the lead with the housing. Yet another desirable feature for such a leash assembly is a release control mechanism to prevent unwanted release of a lead upon sudden acceleration of the animal away from the handler or tethering location, as may occur when an animal becomes excited or angry.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another disadvantage of the retractable leash assemblies of the type commercially available is that they are typically spring biased to the extent that a release mechanism allows a free extension of the lead as the tethered animal travels a greater distance from the handler. As such, in these known devices, the lead cannot normally be retracted or rewound without the handler first providing slack in the lead by following or chasing the animal and thereby shortening the distance between the handler and the animal prior to rewinding the lead for storage. Therefore, it would also be desirable to provide a leash or tethering assembly having a drive mechanism, to facilitate the retrieval of an animal attached to the leash assembly to the proximity of the handler or tethering location without requiring the handler to traverse the distance between themselves and the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, while the foregoing discussion is directed to the leash and tethering assembly art, it is envisioned that such a quick connect coupling assembly as described herein will have numerous other practical applications including, but not limited to, tie downs for tools and equipment, securing luggage and/or sporting equipment, temporary barrier devices, body harnesses, and key chains, as well as in the area of robotics, including integration into automated factory assembly line operations, and remotely controlled devices utilized by military, law enforcement, emergency, and rescue personnel, just to name a few.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention relates to a leash assembly designed to allow control of a dog or other animal by a handler and which is structured to accomplish a quick detachment of the animal from a remote position without requiring the direct handling or manipulation of the quick connect coupling assembly serving to interconnect the collar, harness, or similar attachment assembly to the distal end of the lead. The present invention is also designed and structured to provide a quick and efficient attachment of a lead to an attachment assembly utilizing only a single hand of the user or handler. More specifically, the present invention comprises a flexible material lead being of any appropriate or preferred length and terminating at a distal end and an oppositely disposed proximal end. A preferably rotating coupling component is connected, at least in part, to the distal end of the lead and is specifically structured to accomplish a quick and easy attachment of the lead to the attachment assembly, as well as a quick release or detachment of the lead from an attachment assembly mounted directly on the animal being tethered.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to accomplish such quick release of the coupling assembly, the present invention further comprises a release structure preferably in the form of a release or positioning cable formed of metallic or other applicable material having sufficient structural integrity to be movable axially along its own length and to exert an axially directed force on a coupling assembly to be described in greater detail hereinafter. The term &#x201c;structural integrity&#x201d; refers to the structural features of the release cable being of a material with sufficient rigidity, while still being flexible, to exert the aforementioned axially directed force on the coupling assembly or otherwise structured to be axially moveable along the length of the lead so as to exert the aforementioned force on the coupling assembly and thereby orient the coupling assembly in a disconnect position, as will be explained in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The release structure or cable is mounted on and preferably within the interior of the lead and extends along the length thereof between the aforementioned distal end and proximal end. One end of the release cable is disposed adjacent the distal end of the lead and is connected directly to the preferably rotating coupling component. Selective axial movement of the release cable causes a disconnection of the coupling components defining the subject coupling assembly. The aforementioned quick release is thereby accomplished from a location remote from the animal without the necessity of directly handling or manipulating the coupling assembly. Alternate embodiments of the present invention include a coupling assembly comprising magnetically attractive components, and a release structure comprising an electromagnet whose polarity may be reversed to alternately facilitate automatic attachment and detachment of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To accomplish the desired quick release, the present invention also includes an activation assembly mounted adjacent the proximal end of the lead and includes an activation member connected directly to the correspondingly positioned end of the release cable. Depending upon the various embodiments, to be described in greater detail hereinafter, the activation member may be disposed and configured for direct manipulation by a thumb or finger of a single hand of a person gripping a handle portion of the activation assembly which is connected to the proximal end of the lead. By depressing or otherwise manipulating the activation member, the release cable is forced to move axially along its length relative to the lead on which it is mounted. This movement will cause an axially directed force to be exerted directly on at least one of the coupling components of the coupling assembly and a disconnection of the coupling assembly. A quick release and/or detachment of the attachment assembly will thereby be effected. Additional embodiments of the present invention include an electronically operated activation assembly, which may or may not be radio activated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another feature of one preferred embodiment of the leash assembly of the present invention further includes an activation assembly comprising a drive motor to be actuated by a user. The drive motor is configured, such as by attachment to a storage or take-up spool, to effectuate storage of the lead itself and/or activation of the quick release structure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An additional embodiment of the present invention includes the coupling assembly structured to provide a quick attachment and detachment of the distal, free end of the lead to the attachment assembly mounted on the animal. In addition, a similarly structured coupling assembly may be used to connect opposite free ends of the attachment assembly to one another around the animal in an intended fashion. In the aforementioned coupling assembly, first and second components are structured so as to be attached to one another in a manner which only requires a single hand of the handler or user of the leash assembly of the present invention. Quick and easy release of the two components of the coupling assembly from one another is accomplished by manipulation of the activation assembly and movement of the release structure mounted within the lead, as set forth above. More specifically, each of the components of the present invention may be positioned into a predetermined aligned engagement with one another such that a pushing force exerted on the first and second components of the coupling assembly will cause a quick and efficient attachment of the two components to one another. Such quick attachment can be accomplished without manipulation of a spring biased plunger normally associated with generally known, swivel type coupling assemblies. Further, the coupling assembly may include an alignment assembly structured and disposed to facilitate the aforementioned predetermined aligned engagement of the components with one another. The alignment assembly preferably comprises magnetic surfaces on each component of the coupling assembly cooperatively disposed in engageable relation with one another when the components are aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is an object of the present invention to provide a leash assembly which is strong and secure, yet which also provides for the quick and easy release of the animal restrained thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further object of the present invention is to provide a leash assembly which is substantially easy to operate and does not require direct user manipulation of a coupling assembly when connecting the attachment assembly on the animal to a lead associated with the leash assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is also an important object of the present invention to provide a leash assembly structured to facilitate rapid and efficient connection of an attachment assembly, mounted on the animal, to a lead in a manner which requires minimal manipulation and the use of only one hand of the animal handler.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Yet another object to the present invention is to provide a leash assembly including a lead which may be retracted or extended in a controlled manner whether or not the free end of the lead is secured to the attachment assembly. It is also an important object to the present invention to provide the leash assembly, including the various operative components associated therewith, which is formed from a light weight yet durable material so as to be operable over an extended period and which is structurally designed to be produced or manufactured relatively inexpensively so as to make the present invention available to a wide range of potential customers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is a further object of this invention to provide a quick connect coupling assembly which may be utilized in a variety of other connection applications. The need for a coupling assembly permitting quick release and/or attachment exists in many applications, for example, tie downs for equipment, tools, or machinery, securing luggage and/or sporting equipment, temporary barrier devices, body harnesses, and key chains. Thus, the present invention provides such a quick connect coupling assembly for the aforementioned applications, however, the present invention may be utilized in numerous other connection applications as may easily be envisioned.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in the accompanying Figures, the present invention is directed towards a retractable leash assembly wherein a preferred embodiment is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and includes a lead as in <b>10</b> being of any applicable or desired length and further being formed of a flexible material so as to facilitate freedom of movement of both the animal and the handler or user of the subject assembly, and to a quick connect coupling assembly which includes a coupling assembly generally shown as <b>16</b>, a release structure generally shown as <b>24</b>, and an activation assembly generally shown as <b>38</b>, as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The lead <b>10</b> terminates at a distal end <b>12</b> and a proximal end <b>14</b>, which are oppositely disposed relative to one another. Moreover, a coupling assembly <b>16</b> is secured, at least in part, adjacent the distal end <b>12</b> of the lead <b>10</b> and includes a first component as in <b>18</b> and a second component as in <b>22</b>. The first component <b>18</b> may be secured to the distal end <b>12</b> of the lead <b>10</b> and is connected to a release structure which may be defined in one embodiment by a release or positioning cable <b>24</b>. With further reference to the coupling assembly <b>16</b>, the second component <b>22</b> may be mounted on or attached to a collar, harness, or similar attachment assembly as at <b>26</b> designed to be mounted directly on the animal's body in the conventional fashion. Alternatively, the second component <b>22</b> may be secured to a distal end of a second lead structure as in a tie down assembly, or it may be secured to a fixed structure. Opposite ends of the attachment assembly <b>26</b> may define connectable portions and if desired may be removably attached using a similar second coupling assembly generally indicated as <b>28</b> similar in operation to the coupling assembly <b>16</b> associated with the lead <b>10</b>. Moreover, the attachment assembly <b>26</b> itself may be integrated as part of the present invention wherein the coupling assembly <b>28</b> incorporates specific structural improvements set forth in greater detail hereinafter which provides a quick and efficient attachment or coupling of opposite ends of the attachment assembly <b>26</b>. The second coupling assembly <b>28</b> of the present invention also includes a first component <b>29</b> and a second component <b>30</b> designed to be removably and quickly attached and detached relative to one another so as to secure the attachment assembly <b>26</b> about the neck of the dog or other animal being tethered. Loop type connecting elements as at <b>32</b> may serve to movably mount or attach the components <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> of the second coupling assembly <b>28</b> to the opposite ends of the attachment assembly <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A loop type connector <b>32</b> may also serve to movably mount the second component <b>22</b> of the coupling assembly <b>16</b> to the attachment assembly <b>26</b> such that the entire coupling assembly <b>16</b> is allowed to move freely along the length of the attachment assembly <b>26</b> in order to provide the animal more freedom when connected to the lead <b>10</b> and also to reduce the possibility of tangling of the attachment assembly <b>26</b> with the remainder of the lead <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alternate embodiment is disclosed wherein the second component indicated as <b>22</b>&#x2033; is fixedly mounted on an exterior surface of the attachment assembly <b>26</b>. The structural features of the second component <b>22</b>&#x2033; are similar to that of the second component <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that it is designed to removably receive the first component <b>18</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the release structure which comprises release cable <b>24</b> in a preferred embodiment, is preferably mounted within an interior <b>25</b> of an outer flexible material, such as lead <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The lead <b>10</b> may therefore assume a generally tubular configuration so as to enclose the release cable <b>24</b> in a hollow interior <b>25</b> thereof. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a separate hollow sheath structure <b>27</b> may be provided and preferably secured to or embedded or concealed within the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032;. The sheath structure includes a hollow interior <b>25</b>&#x2032; and preferably extends along the entire length of the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032; so as to enclose the release cable <b>24</b> therein along substantially its entire length. Such a configuration is particularly beneficial in woven material lead structures, or if the lead structure is to be wound, because movement of the release cable <b>24</b> while in an at least partially wound position is required. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the sheath structure <b>27</b> is configured to facilitate the sliding movement of the release cable <b>24</b> relative to the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As set forth above, the coupling assemblies <b>16</b> and/or <b>28</b> may be similarly structured and, as also set forth above, additional, more preferred embodiments of the coupling assemblies similar to <b>16</b> and <b>28</b> are shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; may incorporate structural features similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, in which the coupling assembly is referenced by either 16&#x2032; or <b>16</b>&#x2033;. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, coupling <b>16</b> may include a spring biased plunger <b>51</b>, which when axially disposed inwardly towards an interior portion <b>53</b> of the second component <b>22</b> will serve to release the one or, preferably, two outwardly extending, oppositely disposed locking members <b>62</b> from their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the locking members <b>62</b> will comprise an elongated finger configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. However, it is anticipated that the present invention may encompass other configurations of locking members <b>62</b>, including but not limited too, ball bearings, wedge shaped, cone shaped, etc. Release of the locking members <b>62</b> from their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation will allow attachment of the first coupling component <b>18</b> to the second coupling component <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For purposes of clarity the structural details of the preferred embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6-8</figref>, are explained with reference to coupling assemblies <b>16</b>&#x2032; and <b>16</b>&#x2033; as indicated in the aforementioned Figures. It is again to be emphasized that the structural components of the coupling assemblies <b>16</b>&#x2032; and <b>16</b>&#x2033; may be similar. One similarity between the different embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6-8</figref> is the ability to accomplish a quick and efficient attachment and release of the components of the respective coupling assemblies <b>16</b>&#x2032; and <b>16</b>&#x2033;, such as while utilizing only a single hand of the user. Further, attachment can be accomplished without the physical depression or other manipulation of the spring biased plunger <b>51</b> or any similar component.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">More specifically, a feature of the embodiment of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as well as the additional preferred embodiment <b>16</b>&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> is the inclusion of one or, preferably, two locking members <b>62</b> having an outer surface specifically configured to facilitate the quick and efficient attachment or release of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; to or from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;. In particular, each of the locking members <b>62</b> includes a leading surface portion <b>65</b> and a trailing surface portion <b>67</b>. The locking members <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, are disposed in their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation between the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;. Furthermore, the trailing surface portions <b>67</b> of each of the locking members <b>62</b> are configured into a transverse, linear shape so as define a stop member which will prevent unwanted detachment of the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; from one another such as when they are pulled away from one another by the strain of the animal or other forces. As such, it is necessary to affirmatively dispose the locking members <b>62</b> inwardly into the interior of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; in order to define a retracted orientation and allow passage of the leading end <b>64</b> of component <b>18</b>&#x2032; through the receiving aperture as at <b>69</b> formed in the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Looking in greater detail, the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; comprises a first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and a second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; which, as shown, are respectively configured to define a male coupling component and a female coupling component. At least one, preferably the male coupling component, is preferably structured to rotate or swivel, thereby allowing the entire coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; to be rotatable and swivelable to prevent tangling and the like. As explained above, the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; may be connected to the distal or free end of the lead <b>10</b> and, more specifically, in direct operative attachment to the release structure, which in one preferred embodiment comprises an interior, axially moveable release cable <b>24</b>. The release cable <b>24</b> may be connected directly to a plunger <b>60</b> so as to exert an axially directed force thereon which in turn permits the easy release of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; by virtue of the fact that an axially directed pulling force will cause the plunger <b>60</b> to move outwardly against a force exerted thereon by a biasing spring (not shown). This outward movement of the plunger <b>60</b> will in turn cause the locking members <b>62</b> to be released from their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation and pulled into a retracted orientation, thereby allowing the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; to be easily released from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an alternate embodiment of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2033;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; may comprise oppositely charged magnetic materials, such that the attractive and/or repulsive magnetic forces are sufficient to maintain the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; in their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation. In this embodiment, the plunger <b>60</b> is connected to each locking member <b>62</b>&#x2032;, wherein an outward axial force is required to reposition the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; from their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation to the retracted orientation, so as to allow the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; to be easily released from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In yet another embodiment of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2033;, the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; may in whole or in part comprise a magnetically charged material. Additionally, the release structure comprises an electromagnet which replaces the release cable <b>24</b> and plunger <b>60</b> and generates a stronger, similarly polarized magnetic field relative to the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; such that the repulsive magnetic forces are sufficient to force the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; into their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation. To release the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; in this embodiment of the present invention, an electrical current may be applied to the electromagnet which reverses its polarity, thus causing the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; to be pulled into a retracted orientation by magnetic attraction which permits the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; to be automatically detached from the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;. In such an embodiment, an independent biasing force on the locking members <b>62</b> may not be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A further embodiment of the present invention incorporates an electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> comprising an actuation member <b>162</b> and being disposed in an operative association with at least one, but preferably a plurality of locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A through 28B</figref>. In particular, the operative association is at least partially defined by the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> being structured to normally dispose the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; into an outwardly extending locking orientation. The operative association is further defined by the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> being further structured to selectively dispose the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; into the retracted orientation, upon actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>, such that a first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and a corresponding second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; are detached from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">More specifically, in at least one preferred embodiment, the actuation member <b>162</b> of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> comprises a distal portion <b>163</b> structured to normally dispose the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; in the outwardly extending locking orientation, such as, for example, via displacement of the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</figref>, <b>26</b>B, and <b>28</b>A. Additionally, the distal portion <b>163</b> of the actuation member <b>162</b> is structured to selectively dispose the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; into a retracted orientation, thereby permitting the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; to be detached from one another. The distal portion <b>163</b> of the actuation member <b>162</b> is movably disposable between an extended displacement configuration such that the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; are disposed in the outwardly extending locking orientation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 28A</figref>, and a retracted non-displacement configuration such that the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; are disposed in the retracted orientation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25B and 28B</figref>. In at least one alternate embodiment, the distal portion <b>163</b> may comprise a magnetically charged material, such as, by way of example only, an electromagnetic, so as to further facilitate positioning the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; between the outwardly extending locking orientation and the retracted orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one further embodiment, the distal portion <b>163</b> is movably disposable between a non-displacement configuration such that the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; are disposed in the retracted orientation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> and a displacement configuration such that the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; are disposed in the outwardly extending locking orientation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>. In this embodiment, the actuation member <b>162</b> is structured to rotate about an actuation axis <b>162</b>&#x2032;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</figref>, wherein the required rotation may be accomplished by way of an electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> comprising a rotary solenoid.</p>

In at least one embodiment, the interconnecting members <b>164</b> comprise a shape memory alloy component structured to dispose the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; from the outwardly extending locking orientation to the retracted orientation upon actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>. Specifically, actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> results in an electrical current being at least temporarily applied to the shape memory alloy component, thereby altering its physical configuration and causing the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; to be reoriented.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> may comprise any one of a number of electrically actuated devices including, by way of example only and in no manner limited to, solenoids, transformers, electromagnets, capacitors, electric motors, shape memory alloy components, magnetic propulsion devices, etc. Looking just at solenoids, the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> may comprise a plunger type solenoid, a hammer type solenoid, a swing solenoid, a rotary solenoid, a tubular type solenoid, etc., and these are only a few of the possible types of solenoids illustrative of those which may be comprised by the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> of the present invention. As such, it is understood that any electromotive device comprising an actuation member <b>162</b> which may effect the disposition of the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; between the outwardly extending locking orientation and the retracted orientation upon application of an electrical current, may be utilized and are encompassed in the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">To facilitate actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>, an actuation interface <b>166</b> is provided and is structured to facilitate selective actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>, via selective application of an electrical current to the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>, as desired by the user. The actuation interface <b>166</b> may comprise a direct interconnection to the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> such as, for example, an electrical wire extending along the lead <b>10</b> between the rechargeable power supply <b>81</b>&#x2032; of the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> and the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>. As such, a selective activation member <b>44</b>&#x2032;, as described herein, may be utilized to selectively actuate the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> via selective application of an electrical current from the rechargeable power supply <b>81</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In at least one embodiment, the actuation interface <b>166</b> is disposed in a communicative relationship with a voice activated control module <b>110</b>, also as described herein, thereby allowing the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> to be remotely actuated. One further embodiment of the present invention comprises a manual release mechanism <b>167</b> interconnected to the actuation interface <b>166</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, the manual release mechanism <b>167</b> structured to permit manual actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>, thereby allowing the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; to be quickly and easily detached from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also as indicated, a further feature of the present invention is its ability to achieve easy and effective engagement or attachment between the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;. This attachment is preferably facilitated by virtue of the fact that the leading surface portion <b>65</b> of each of the locking members <b>62</b> has a substantially convergent configuration which extends outwardly in either a curvilinear or sloped shape. Accordingly, engagement of the leading surface portion <b>65</b> with the periphery of the receiving aperture <b>69</b> will cause a sliding engagement of the respective locking members <b>62</b> relative to the periphery of the receiving aperture <b>69</b> and thereby cause a forced, inward retraction of the locking members <b>62</b> to counter their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation. The leading end <b>64</b> of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; will thereby be allowed to pass through the receiving aperture <b>69</b> into the engaged and attached position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref> in a substantially facilitated manner.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In order to accomplish such quick and easy attachment of the components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; together into the attached position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; should be disposed in predetermined aligned engagement with one another. Such predetermined aligned engagement may be defined by an axial alignment of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; with the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Once the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; are in the aforementioned axial alignment, forced positioning of these two components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; towards one another as indicated by directional arrows <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> will cause sliding contact of the leading surface portion <b>65</b> with the periphery of the receiving aperture <b>69</b> resulting in the predetermined aligned engagement of the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032;. The cooperatively structured configuration of the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; of the preferred embodiment of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; allows the predetermined aligned engagement and attachment of the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; by the user with a single hand.</p>

In the embodiment of illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the attraction assembly <b>75</b> includes at least the exposed annular surface <b>72</b> of the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; being formed of a magnetic material and configured to attract a similar annular surface <b>74</b> of the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;, also formed of a magnetic material. In the locking position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, these magnetically attractive surfaces <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> will normally be brought into confronting engagement with one another. The provision of the magnetically attractive surfaces <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> and their relative disposition to one another will facilitate the axial alignment of the components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; as well as the inwardly directed connecting force indicated by directional arrows <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> such that the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; are automatically attached.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition to the ability to achieve easy and effective engagement or attachment of the components of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032;, at least one embodiment of present invention comprises an electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, structured to at least temporarily impart a separation force between the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;. More in particular, the electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b> of the present invention comprises at least one propulsion member <b>172</b>, however, in one preferred embodiment, the electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b> comprises a plurality of propulsion members <b>172</b> disposed in a spaced apart relation to one another, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b> of the present invention is specifically structured to dispose the propulsion members <b>172</b> between a secured configuration and a separated configuration.

The disposition of the propulsion members <b>172</b> from the secured configuration to the separated configuration results in a separation force between the first component <b>18</b>&#x2032; and the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032; of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>&#x2032; in a direction substantially normal to the propulsion interface <b>174</b>, as indicated by directional arrows <b>176</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">To assure that locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; are disposed in the retracted orientation prior to disposition of the propulsion members <b>172</b> into the separated configuration, so as to prevent jamming of the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; in the interior of the second component <b>22</b>&#x2032;, at least one embodiment of the present invention comprises a time sequence module. The time sequence module is structured such that actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b> effecting retraction of the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; must occur a preselected period of time before the electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b> is permitted to operate to dispose the propulsion members <b>172</b> into the separated configuration. The preselected period of time is determined by the amount of time required for the locking members <b>62</b>&#x2032; to fully retract after actuation of the electromotive release mechanism <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In at least one embodiment, the electromotive propulsion mechanism <b>170</b> may comprise an attraction mechanism, such as, for example, an electromagnet, structured to be actuated by the time sequence module upon disposition of each of the propulsion members <b>172</b> from the outwardly extended position into an at least partially inwardly retracted position.

In particular, the locking members <b>262</b> are structured to be disposed in an abutting relation with at least an abutment portion <b>220</b> of the second component <b>218</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the locking elements <b>262</b> are cooperatively structured with the abutment portion <b>220</b> of the second component <b>218</b> to at least partially define a complementary locking interface <b>221</b> being disposed between the locking members <b>262</b> and the abutment portion <b>220</b> of the second component <b>218</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, when disposed in such an abutting relation, the locking members <b>262</b> of the locking assembly <b>260</b> are structured and disposed to prevent detachment of the second component <b>218</b> from the first component <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates a complementary locking interface <b>221</b> further defined by an abutment portion <b>220</b> of the second component <b>218</b> comprising a sloping surface extending downwardly from the receiving aperture <b>219</b> towards the exterior of the second component <b>218</b>. Furthermore, the leading surface portions <b>265</b> of the locking members <b>262</b> of this illustrative embodiment also comprise a downwardly sloping surface which &#x201c;compliments&#x201d; the slope of the abutment portion <b>220</b>, thereby further defining the complementary locking interface <b>221</b> and serving to prevent the unintentional detachment of the first component <b>222</b> from the second component <b>218</b>. In particular, in this embodiment, the leading surface portions <b>265</b> of the locking members <b>262</b> must be extended up and over the sloping abutment portion <b>220</b> of the second component <b>218</b> before the locking members <b>262</b> may be disposed into an inwardly retracted release orientation, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, thereby permitting detachment of the first component <b>222</b> from the second component <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">At least one embodiment of the quick connect coupling assembly <b>216</b> of the present invention comprises an attraction assembly <b>275</b> structured to facilitate disposition of the first component <b>222</b> and the second component <b>218</b> into a predetermined alignment with one another. The attraction assembly <b>275</b> of the present invention comprises at least one attraction element <b>276</b> mounted to a first component <b>222</b>, or a second component <b>218</b>, or, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the attraction assembly <b>275</b> comprises an attraction element <b>276</b> mounted to each of a first component <b>222</b> and a second component <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The attraction assembly <b>275</b> in at least one embodiment comprises a plurality of magnetic attraction elements <b>277</b>, such as are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</figref>. More in particular, and as in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</figref>, at least one magnetic attraction element <b>277</b> is mounted to each of the first component <b>222</b> and the second component <b>218</b>. Furthermore, the magnetic attraction elements <b>277</b> are structured and disposed to create an attractive magnetic force to facilitate disposition of the first component <b>222</b> and the second component <b>218</b> into the predetermined alignment with one another, as illustrated, by way of example only, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As is also illustrated in the figures, the magnetic attraction elements <b>277</b> are structured and disposed in a &#x201c;free floating&#x201d; configuration, that is to say, they are structured and disposed so as to prevent any physical contact with one another. This &#x201c;free floating&#x201d; feature provides several advantages over other magnetic attachment devices. First, by preventing physical contact, mechanical degradation of the magnets of the magnetic attraction elements <b>277</b> is essentially eliminated, thereby significantly increasing the useful life of the magnets. In addition, the &#x201c;free floating&#x201d; configuration facilitates detachment of the first component <b>222</b> and the second component <b>218</b>, by eliminating the significant force required to separate magnetic elements which are physically contacting one another.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In at least one embodiment, the attractive magnetic force between the magnetic attraction members <b>277</b> is selectively adjustable. Specifically, in at least the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</figref>, at least one of the magnetic attraction members <b>277</b> comprises an adjustable mount <b>278</b> structured to be moveable such that a distance between the elements <b>277</b> is selectively adjustable. In at least one embodiment, the adjustable mount <b>278</b> may comprise a threaded mount, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 34</figref>, wherein the distance between the magnetic attraction members <b>277</b> is adjusted by simply rotating the magnetic attraction element(s) <b>277</b> farther in or out via the adjustable mount <b>278</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one further embodiment, at least one magnetic attraction element <b>277</b> is removeably mounted to either the first component <b>222</b> or the second component <b>218</b> via an adjustable mount <b>278</b>, such that a magnetic attraction member <b>277</b> exhibiting greater or lesser magnetic force may be quickly and easily installed, thereby allowing a user to select the magnetic force to be exhibited by the attraction assembly <b>275</b> over a wide range of magnetic forces, such as may be necessitated by the various coupling applications in which the present assembly may be utilized. Of course, it is within the intent and scope of the present invention to adjust a distance between the magnetic attraction members <b>277</b> other than via a threaded mount, and in at least one embodiment, each of a plurality of magnetic attraction members <b>277</b> may comprise an adjustable mount <b>278</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The quick connect coupling assembly <b>216</b> of the present invention may also comprise a shielding mechanism <b>290</b>, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, having at least one shielding element <b>292</b> which is structured to direct the attractive magnetic force between the magnetic attractive elements <b>277</b>. The shielding element <b>292</b> is further structured to prevent the attractive magnetic force from attracting an unintended object. The shielding mechanism <b>290</b> of the present invention may comprise a flux-entrapment shield, or a lossy shield, which are basic types of 60 Hz shields.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A flux-entrapment shield is typically constructed of a ferromagnetic, highly permeable nickel-iron alloy. In at least one embodiment, the shielding element <b>292</b> may comprise an alloy which is approximately 80% nickel and 20% iron, such as, Hipernom Alloy, CO-NETIC AA, Aumetal, AD-MU-80, etc. Further, the shielding element <b>292</b> may be structured to isolate an area from a magnetic source by either surrounding the area, such as a cylinder or rectangular box, or separating the area from the magnetic source, such as via a &#x201c;U&#x201d;-shaped or flat plate. In operation, the magnetic flux generated by a magnetic source preferentially enters and travels through the highly permeable material along a path of least magnetic reluctance, rather than passing through the highly permeable material to the area isolated by such a shielding element <b>292</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Alternatively, the shielding mechanism <b>290</b> of the present invention may employ a lossy magnetic shielding system which utilizes the eddy current losses occurring within highly conductive materials including, but not limited to, copper, aluminum, iron, steel, silicon-iron, etc. More in particular, when a highly conductive material is subject to a time varying, e.g., 60 Hz, magnetic field, magnetic currents are induced within the material which flow in closed circular paths, perpendicular to the inducing magnetic field. According to Lenz's Law, these eddy currents oppose the charges in the inducing field such that the magnetic fields produced by the circulating eddy currents act to cancel the larger, external inducing magnetic fields at or near the conductive surface of the shielding material, thereby imparting a shielding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The figures illustrative of the present embodiment of a quick release coupling assembly <b>216</b> also show a biasing mechanism <b>270</b> comprising at least one biasing element <b>272</b> structured to normally dispose and maintain the locking members <b>262</b> of the locking assembly <b>260</b> in the outwardly extending locking orientation. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 33A</figref>, in at least one embodiment, the biasing mechanism <b>270</b> comprises a magnetic biasing element <b>273</b> mounted to each of oppositely disposed ones of the plurality of locking elements <b>261</b>. As further illustrated in the figures, the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> are structured and disposed so as to create a repulsive magnetic force between one another, as demonstrated by the double headed arrows in the referenced figures. In at least one embodiment, the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> are structured such that the repulsive magnetic force generated between the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> serves to maintain the locking members <b>262</b> disposed on corresponding ones of the locking elements <b>261</b> in the normally disposed outwardly extending orientation, by forcing the locking elements <b>261</b> away from one another in opposite directions, once again, as shown by the double headed arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 33A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one further embodiment, the biasing mechanism <b>270</b> is structured such that a repulsive magnetic force between the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> is selectively adjustable. More in particular, at least one of the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> comprises an adjustable base structured to be moveable such that a distance between the magnetic biasing elements <b>273</b> mounted to oppositely disposed ones of the locking elements <b>261</b> is selectively adjustable, thereby affecting the magnitude of the repulsive force exerted by each magnetic biasing element <b>273</b> towards one another.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In yet one other embodiment of the quick connect coupling assembly <b>216</b> of the present invention, the biasing mechanism <b>270</b> comprises a spring <b>274</b>, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</figref>, mounted between oppositely disposed ones of the plurality of locking elements <b>261</b> wherein the spring <b>274</b> is structured to maintain corresponding ones of the locking members <b>262</b> in the normally disposed outwardly extending orientation, once again, by forcing the locking elements <b>261</b> into opposite directions from one another. The spring <b>274</b> may be selected to provide greater or lesser amounts of force when disposed into an operative position, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</figref>, such that, once again, the force generated by the biasing mechanism <b>270</b> may be selectively adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The quick connect coupling assembly <b>216</b> of the present invention also comprises a release mechanism <b>280</b> structured to permit the locking members <b>262</b> to be temporarily disposed into an inwardly retracted release orientation. More in particular, the release mechanism <b>280</b> comprises at least one release member <b>282</b> mounted to one of a plurality of locking elements <b>261</b>, wherein the release member <b>282</b> is structured to be normally disposed in an outwardly extending orientation while the locking assembly <b>260</b> is disposed in a locking orientation, as is illustrated throughout the figures. Further, the release member <b>282</b> is disposable into a release orientation thereby temporarily disposing one or more locking member <b>262</b> into an inwardly retracted release orientation, as illustrated by way of example only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, such that the first component <b>222</b> and the second component <b>218</b> may be detached from one another. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the release assembly <b>280</b> may comprise a plurality of release members <b>282</b> each mounted to a different one of a plurality of release elements <b>261</b> such that while a release force <b>283</b> is applied in the direction of the arrows, such as by squeezing by a user, each of a corresponding plurality of locking members <b>262</b> is temporarily disposed into the inwardly retracted release orientation</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">To prevent unintentional disposition of one or more release member <b>282</b> into the release orientation, at least one embodiment of the present invention comprises a safety mechanism <b>284</b> structured to impede the application of a release force <b>283</b> to the release member <b>282</b>. More in particular, the release mechanism <b>284</b> is structured and normally disposed in a safety on configuration which, in at least one embodiment, comprises a substantially overlying relation to the release member <b>282</b>, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. When desired by a user, the safety mechanism <b>284</b> is structured and disposable into a safety off configuration substantially exposing the release member(s) <b>282</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 37A</figref>, thereby permitting disposition of the release member(s) <b>282</b> into the release orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">To facilitate disposition between the safety on and safety off configurations, at least one embodiment of the present invention comprises a moveable safety member <b>285</b>.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention wherein the second component <b>222</b> of a quick connect coupling assembly <b>216</b> comprises a global positioning system (&#x201c;GPS&#x201d;) microchip <b>300</b> mounted thereto. In at least one embodiment, the GPS microchip <b>300</b> is embedded in the first component <b>218</b>, rather than the second component <b>222</b>, in that the first component <b>218</b> is structured to remain attached to an animal via a collar or harness, so as to protect it from the elements, as well as to conceal its presence as may be desirable in some cases. More importantly, the GPS microchip <b>300</b> is structured to permit the location of the first component <b>218</b>, and thus, the animal to which it is attached, to be tracked via a GPS satellite system, virtually anywhere on the planet. This embodiment of the present invention eliminates the need for implanting a GPS chip under the skin of an animal, as is commonly done today, which can result in discomfort the animal in many cases, as well as presenting, potentially serious, health risks to others.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Looking once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention comprises an activation assembly <b>38</b>. The activation assembly <b>38</b> is preferably, although not necessarily, integrated as part of a handle <b>40</b> structured to facilitate holding of the leash assembly during use. The handle <b>40</b> preferably includes a generally apertured construction <b>42</b> and further defines gripping means <b>43</b> dimensioned and configured to facilitate the holding or gripping of the handle <b>40</b> by a single hand of a user of the subject leash assembly. One feature of the present invention is the provision of an activation member as at <b>44</b> generally in the form of a spring biased push button, which, due to the force exerted thereon by a biasing spring (not shown for purposes of clarity) is preferably normally disposed in an outward position as shown. The activation member <b>44</b> is connected directly to a correspondingly positioned end of the release structure or release cable <b>24</b>. The release cable <b>24</b>, may be formed of a metallic material or other applicable materials. Regardless of the structural embodiments, release cable <b>24</b> should be sufficiently flexible to be rolled upon itself in a stored position or otherwise oriented as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but should have sufficient structural integrity to be movable axially along its length, within the interior of the lead <b>10</b> and relative thereto. Such axial movement may be accomplished by a force exerted by the user of the subject assembly on the activation member or push button <b>44</b> as indicated by directional arrow <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises basic structural features similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and with the exception that the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032; has a somewhat flat strap like configuration extending along its length. However, at least a portion of the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032; defines a hollow interior along the entire length thereof for the positioning and axial movement of the release structure or cable <b>24</b>. Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a sheath structure <b>27</b> may be disposed within the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The activation assembly <b>38</b>&#x2032; of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is associated with a handle structure <b>40</b>&#x2032; having a somewhat different configuration than that of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, the handle <b>40</b>&#x2032; comprises an open, central aperture construction <b>42</b>&#x2032; having a grip <b>43</b>&#x2032; designed to facilitate gripping by one hand of the user of the subject assembly. In this embodiment, however, the activation assembly <b>38</b>&#x2032; comprises an activation member <b>44</b>&#x2032; in the form of a trigger type switch positionable for operation by a single finger of the gripping hand of the user of the subject assembly. The activation member <b>44</b>&#x2032; is normally biased into its outermost position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by any type of biasing spring or the like. However, depression or movement of the activation member <b>44</b>&#x2032; to an inner position serves to axially move the release structure or cable <b>24</b>. Such axial movement will exert an outward axial force on the plunger <b>60</b> which will serve to release the first component <b>18</b> of the coupling assembly <b>16</b> from the second component <b>22</b>. Additional embodiments of the activation assembly are disclosed, such as <b>80</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is similar in structure and operation to activation assembly <b>80</b>, as described hereinafter for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">An additional structural feature of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and in particular the activation assembly <b>38</b>, is the inclusion of a lock structure indicated as <b>50</b>. The lock structure <b>50</b> may have any applicable or adequate structure secured to handle <b>40</b>&#x2032; so as to prevent the depression or inward travel of the activation member <b>44</b>&#x2032;. This will prevent the inadvertent detachment of the coupling assembly <b>16</b> and eliminate the possibility of accidentally releasing or detaching the animal from the lead <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p>

The drive motor <b>88</b> is preferably electrically powered and is specifically structured to be reversible so as to rotate the take-up spool <b>86</b> in opposite directions. The opposite directions of rotation of the drive motor <b>88</b> serve to either retract or release the lead <b>10</b> thereby allowing complete control over a tethered animal attached to the distal or free end of the lead <b>10</b>. By virtue of the drive mechanism <b>85</b> comprising the drive motor <b>88</b> and the take-up spool <b>86</b>, a user or handler of the subject leash assembly is allowed to avoid the disadvantages associated with spring driven, retraction structures of the type typically found in conventional retractable leash assemblies. The drive mechanism <b>85</b> may also utilize magnetic propulsion, as described above, to further facilitate the release and/or retraction of the lead <b>10</b> by the drive mechanism <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one preferred embodiment, the activation assembly <b>80</b> further comprises a release control mechanism structured to regulate the rate of release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b>, upon detection of a predetermined condition or control set point. More specifically, the release control mechanism is structured to either substantially stop the release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b>, or to attenuate the rate of release of the lead <b>10</b>. The predetermined condition or set point may include a particular velocity of release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b>, or a particular acceleration of the release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b>. In at least one embodiment, the release control mechanism is structured to cooperatively associate with the drive mechanism <b>85</b> to either substantially stop or attenuate the release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b>. In order to facilitate attenuation of the release of the lead <b>10</b>, the release control mechanism may incorporate a computerized time delay program which allows the handler to preselect a degree of attenuation for the rate of release of the lead <b>10</b> from the housing <b>84</b> as appropriate, based upon the size of the animal being controlled with the leash assembly. Additionally, the computer program also being structured to control the velocity of the drive motor <b>88</b>, in accordance with the preselected degree of attenuation, upon detection of the predetermined condition.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further with regard to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the housing <b>84</b> includes a handle structure generally indicated as <b>89</b> which may be dimensioned and configured to have a hollow interior so as to house an electrical power supply used to energize at least the drive motor <b>88</b>. Such an electrical power supply of course may be in the form of a rechargeable direct current battery pack, or another type of rechargeable power supply such as, by way of example, a solar power supply having storage capabilities, structured to supply sufficient power to operate the drive motor <b>88</b>. The housing <b>84</b>&#x2032; may also include a recharge port as at <b>83</b>&#x2032; to permit interconnection of the rechargeable direct current battery pack to a source of power, such as via a standard household current power source, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. It should also be noted that the overall configuration of the housing <b>84</b> could be such as to include an apertured configuration as at <b>96</b> which along with the dimension and configuration of the battery casing segment of the handle structure <b>89</b> may form a handle or grip to facilitate carrying or manipulation of the activation assembly <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> further comprises a switching assembly, generally indicated as <b>90</b>, wherein one or more switches as at <b>92</b> may be used to operate the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032; and an additional one or two switches as at <b>94</b> are used to axially move the aforementioned release cable <b>24</b> so as to cause the release of components <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> of the coupling assembly <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> may incorporate a voice activated control module <b>110</b> including an audio receiver <b>112</b> disposed in a communicative relationship with an integrated computerized circuit board <b>114</b> which controls the operation of the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032;, thereby controlling either the retraction or release the lead <b>10</b>, based upon a verbal command from the handler to the voice activated control module <b>110</b>, via the audio receiver <b>112</b>. In addition, the voice activated control module <b>110</b> may also be utilized to control the release cable <b>24</b> or other release mechanism upon verbal command of the handler. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the coupling assembly <b>16</b> or <b>28</b> may comprise a voice activated control module <b>110</b>, wherein the coupling assembly <b>16</b> or <b>28</b> is structured to release the first component <b>18</b> or <b>29</b> from the second component <b>22</b> or <b>30</b>, respectively, based upon a verbal command from the handler to the audio receiver <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In at least one embodiment, the voice activated control module <b>110</b> further comprises an audio transmitter, for example, an audio speaker in combination with the audio receiver <b>112</b>, such that the handler may remotely convey verbal or other audible signals to the animal or animals being restrained by the leash assembly. The audio transmitter may be mounted to the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b>, or, in at least one embodiment, the audio transmitter may be mounted directly to the coupling assembly <b>16</b>. Additionally, the verbal or other audible signal may be preprogrammed such that the handler may convey the desired verbal or other audible signal to the animal by merely selecting the desired preprogrammed command, such as, via a keypad located on the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b>, or on a remote transmitter structured to communicate with the voice activated module <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">With regard to the additional preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the activation assembly <b>82</b> comprises a housing as at <b>100</b> having a substantially hollow interior configuration for the mounting of a drive motor <b>88</b>&#x2032; and a storage or take-up spool generally indicated as <b>102</b>. The take-up spool <b>102</b> may have a spiral configuration which stores the lead <b>10</b> about the length of the take-up spool <b>102</b> wherein a cushioning spring as at <b>104</b> is provided to cushion the movement of the lead <b>10</b> into and out of the housing <b>100</b>. Again, the drive motor <b>88</b>&#x2032; is structured to be reversible so as to selectively accomplish both retraction and release of the lead <b>10</b> relative to the take-up spool <b>102</b>. A switching assembly generally indicated as at <b>90</b> is also mounted on the housing <b>100</b> operatively associated with the drive motor <b>88</b>&#x2032; and to the release structure in the form of release cable <b>24</b> as explained above. As indicated above with reference to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the drive motor <b>88</b>&#x2032; may incorporate the voice activated control module <b>110</b> to control the drive motor <b>88</b>&#x2032; to retract or release the lead <b>10</b> and/or to control the release cable <b>24</b> or other release mechanism, based upon the particular verbal command from the handler. A separable casing segment <b>105</b> may be provided to enclose and secure a rechargeable battery therein, wherein the entire casing <b>105</b> and the battery mounted on the interior thereof may be removed from the remainder of the housing <b>100</b> for purposes of recharging or replacing.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Of course, however, in either of the embodiments comprising a drive mechanism <b>85</b>, the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032; may be configured to only manipulate the release cable <b>24</b>, with the lead <b>10</b> itself being either of a fixed length or retractable. For example, in an embodiment with a long lead <b>10</b> or wherein the lead <b>10</b> is substantially wound in a stored orientation, a greater force may be required to actuate the release cable <b>24</b>. As such, the drive motor could be used solely for the release cable <b>24</b>. Additionally, whether the drive motor <b>88</b> provides for powered movement of the lead <b>10</b> and/or the release cable <b>24</b>, a one way drive motor could also be effectively employed so long as an automatically or affirmatively releasing engagement with the retracted lead <b>10</b> is achieved. For example, if the lead <b>10</b> is retracted by the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032; a similar release as to that which is normally provided to release an inward spring bias can be employed to allow the lead <b>10</b> to be released without causing or requiring a reversal of the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032;. Also, as to the release cable <b>24</b>, only a momentary axial force applied to the release cable <b>24</b> is required to release the first component <b>18</b> from the second component <b>22</b>. As such, the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032; could be configured to pull on the release cable <b>24</b> a limited amount of time, after which it may automatically back out after which a normal bias on the release cable <b>24</b> can cause a clutch type release.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Another embodiment of the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> may include the electrical power supply operatively associated with the electromagnet of the alternative embodiment of the release structure <b>24</b> presented above. The activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> operates by providing sufficient electrical current to the electromagnet to reverse its polarity such that it exhibits either attractive or repulsive magnetic forces relative to the locking members <b>62</b>. The attractive or repulsive magnetic forces may cause the locking members <b>62</b> to be repositioned from their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation into their retracted orientation, thereby permitting the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to be easily released from one another. Alternatively, the attractive or repulsive magnetic forces may cause the locking members <b>62</b> to be repositioned from their retracted orientation into their normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation, thereby securing the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In yet another embodiment, the locking members <b>62</b> may comprise a shape memory alloy structured to deform from a normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation to a retracted orientation, upon application of an electrical current, thereby permitting the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to be easily released from one another. Alternatively, the release cable <b>24</b> or other release structure may comprise a shape memory alloy structured to deform, once again, upon application of an electrical current, thereby causing the locking members <b>62</b> to be repositioned from a normally biased outwardly extending locking orientation to a retracted orientation, thus allowing the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to be released from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As previously described, the switching assembly <b>90</b> may be employed to activate the electrical current to the electromagnet when quick and easy release of the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; is desired. In at least one embodiment of the present invention, the switching assembly <b>90</b> comprises part of an electrical circuit which directly applies the electrical current to the electromagnet, while in at least one other embodiment, the switching assembly <b>90</b> utilizes a fiber optic circuit which indirectly causes the electrical current to be applied to the electromagnet. The switching assembly <b>90</b> may further be structured so as to permit the handler to transmit a small electrical impulse to the attachment assembly <b>26</b> worn by the animal, thereby directing a small electrical shock, vibration, or other electrical stimulation to the animal, such as have been proven to be an effective training tool. In a preferred embodiment, the handler can selectively adjust the magnitude of the electrical impulse to suit the size and temperament of the animal being trained.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Each of the embodiments of the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> comprising the drive mechanism <b>85</b> as presented herein may additionally comprise a radio or other remote signal receiver structured to activate or deactivate the drive mechanism <b>85</b> and/or the release cable <b>24</b> or other release mechanism from a remote location via a radio transmitter. In this embodiment, a receiver may be operatively connected to the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b>, which is structured to receive predetermined signal(s) from a remotely located radio transmitter, or other remote signal transmitter. Once the transmitted signal is received, the receiver triggers the switch assembly <b>90</b> such that the activation assembly <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> causes the drive motor <b>88</b> or <b>88</b>&#x2032; to operate and retract or release the lead <b>10</b>, and/or such as to cause the release structure <b>24</b> to release the first and second components <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032; from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">One other embodiment of the activation assembly <b>80</b> of the present invention comprises a lead aligning mechanism, generally shown as <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 through 17</figref>. The lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> is structured to maintain the lead <b>10</b> in an aligned position relative to the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b> as the lead <b>10</b> is retracted into or released from the housing <b>84</b>. More specifically, the aligned position is at least partially defined when the lead <b>10</b> is positioned relative to the housing <b>84</b> so as to minimize the potential for binding or other restriction of movement of the lead <b>10</b> either into or from the housing <b>84</b>, such as, for example, when the lead <b>10</b> forms an angle of approximately ninety (90) degrees with the housing at its point of entry. The minimization of binding or other restriction of the lead <b>10</b> into and out of the housing provides the handler with greater control over the animal being restrained by the leash assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 through 16</figref>, the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> is movable along at least a portion of the housing <b>84</b> in an arcuate path about a central axis <b>87</b>, and in at least one embodiment, the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> comprises a moveable grip member <b>130</b>. Specifically, the movable grip member <b>130</b> is structured and disposed to moveably engage a grip member track, such as, by way of example only, an external grip member track <b>132</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 through 14</figref>. In another embodiment, the grip member track may comprise an internal grip member track <b>133</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. The degree of movement of the moveable grip member <b>130</b> is limited by grip member track stops <b>135</b>, positioned at each end of the grip member track <b>132</b> or <b>133</b>, when either end of the moveable grip member <b>136</b> contacts either grip member track stop <b>135</b>. It is understood that as the distance between the animal and the handler holding the activation assembly <b>80</b> increases and decreases, the angle formed between the lead and the activation assembly <b>80</b> also increases and decreases, respectively. However, by virtue of the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> being moveable, and more specifically, the moveable grip member <b>130</b> being rotatable along at least a portion of the housing <b>84</b> about the central axis <b>87</b>, it is also understood that the lead <b>10</b> is maintained in a substantially normal orientation relative to the housing <b>84</b>. Thus, the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> minimizes the potential for binding or other restriction of movement of the lead <b>10</b> into or from the housing <b>84</b>, without requiring the handler to adjust or reposition of the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b> relative to the lead <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Another embodiment of the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. In this embodiment, the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> comprises a movable slide member <b>140</b>, which is also structured to be movable along at least a portion of the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b> along an arcuate path about the central axis <b>87</b>. As illustrated in the figures, the movable slide member <b>140</b> comprises a slide slot <b>142</b> structured to permit at least a portion of lead <b>10</b> to pass therethrough into and out of the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b>. The lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b>, in this embodiment, comprises a slide member track <b>144</b> which may be mounted along an exterior portion of the housing <b>84</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. However, it is understood that the slide member track <b>144</b> could be disposed along the interior of the housing <b>84</b> in a similar manner as the internal grip member track <b>133</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. Further, in this embodiment, the housing <b>84</b> comprises a lead receiving channel <b>146</b> which is positioned substantially along the path of the slide member track <b>144</b>, the lead receiving channel <b>146</b> being wide enough to permit the lead <b>10</b> to freely pass therethrough into the housing <b>84</b> regardless of the position of the moveable slide member <b>140</b> along the slide member track <b>144</b>. Each end <b>147</b> of the lead receiving channel <b>146</b> may serve to limit the degree of movement of the moveable slide member <b>140</b> along the path of the slide member track <b>144</b>, similar to the grip member track stops <b>135</b>, or alternatively, one or more slide member track stops <b>148</b> may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In yet another embodiment, the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> may comprise a guide member <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. The guide member <b>150</b>, as shown, comprises a generally spherical configuration and is structured to be moveably secured within a guide seat <b>152</b>, which is preferably disposed about a circumference of the guide member <b>150</b> and connected to the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b>. In particular, the guide member <b>150</b> is structured to rotate freely about a guide axis <b>154</b> in any direction or path, as illustrated by the directional arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, over a surface comprising substantially a hemisphere of the guide member <b>150</b> which is extending outwardly from the housing <b>84</b>. The guide member <b>150</b> comprises a guide channel <b>156</b> disposed substantially along the guide axis <b>154</b> and structured to permit the lead <b>10</b> to pass therethrough into and out of the housing <b>84</b>. It is understood from the figures that the lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b> comprising the guide member <b>150</b> provides the greatest range of lead alignment by virtue of the fact that the guide member <b>150</b> is structured to permit the lead <b>10</b> to move from side to side as well as up and down relative to the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the embodiment of the activation assembly <b>80</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the portion of the housing <b>84</b> to which the guide member <b>150</b> is connected comprises a wide configuration to facilitate a larger directional range of movement of the lead <b>10</b>, for example, from side to side and up and down relative to the housing <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of the activation assembly <b>80</b> wherein the housing <b>84</b> comprises a generally spherical configuration. In this embodiment, the take-up spool <b>86</b> is structured such that the lead <b>10</b> also comprises a substantially spherical configuration within the housing <b>84</b>, as it is wound onto the take-up spool <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Yet another embodiment of an activation assembly <b>80</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In particular, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates the activation assembly comprising a composite lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b>&#x2032;. As shown in the figure, the composite lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b>&#x2032; comprises a moveable grip member <b>130</b>, similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, and a guide member <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. The composite lead aligning mechanism <b>120</b>&#x2032; allows the lead to move freely in both arcuate and rotational directions relative to the housing <b>84</b> of the activation assembly <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiment of the invention, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
