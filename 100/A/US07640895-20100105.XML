<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A significantly improved leash has a strap or belt with a carabiner at a lower end and a loop at an upper end. The loop may be a preconfigured holding loop or it may be an adjustable loop that can be adjusted by clipping a carabiner into eyelets in the leash. The leash permits even an animal that is pulling strongly on the leash to be held in check, by a hand grip disposed in the holding loop, or adjacent to the holding loop.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to leashes, or leads, of the type having a strap or belt and a carabiner hook or snap hook at a bottom end, for attaching to an animal's collar or harness. The strap or belt further has a retaining loop at a top end. The loop is either fixed or it can be adjusted by engaging a carabiner hook or a snap hook in eyelets disposed along the leash.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional short or long leashes can be used to leash animals, in particular dogs, with a greater or lesser clearance. Such known leashes usually have, at their ends, retaining loops which make it possible to control an animal that pulls strongly on the leash. In many cases, such retaining loops nevertheless do not provide a firm grip for a hand holding the leash, with the result that it is possible that a thin leash cannot be reliably secured in every position and for an animal to break away together with the leash. Furthermore, these known leashes cannot be utilized, at any rate without further accessories, for reliably transporting animals in motor vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The retaining loop may be a prefabricated retaining loop and/or an adjustable retaining loop formed by engaging a snap hook in eyelets along the strap. In other words, the novel leash, similarly to prior art leashes, includes a strap or belt with a carabiner hook at a bottom end, for attaching to an animal using a collar or a harness, and a prefabricated retaining loop, and/or one which can be produced by engaging a carabiner hook in spaced-apart eyelets, at its top end. The leash according to this aspect of the invention also has, in the retaining loop or directly in front of the latter, a dimensionally stable or other handgrip which makes it possible for a leash to be gripped and secured such that it cannot slip out between the fingers of a hand, with the result that even strong animals can be led securely using a leash equipped with such a handgrip.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the handgrip contains a buckle of a motor vehicle seat belt, which is secured on the leash and can be moved out of the handgrip. The closure part may be substantially the same length as the handgrip and be produced from metal and thus forming the rigid core of the handgrip.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the handgrip comprises the closure part and a sheath which is itself provided with a closure, by which it can be opened and closed over its length, for example with a touch-and-close fastener, with the result that the closure part is easily accessible and is just as easy to stow away again. This inventive leash thus ensures that it is always possible to carry along a seat belt without it being necessary to provide or carry along within the motor vehicle any further necessary components which, accordingly, also cannot be forgotten or left lying around.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Such a closure part advantageously has a locking section and a fastening section which has a through-passage, through which the strap or the belt of the leash extends, with the result that it can be adjusted in position on the leash or is secured in a certain position, for example by transverse seams in a doubled region of the leash, but can be moved into any desired angled position in relation to the leash.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is also preferably possible for the closure part of the leash according to the invention to be formed in two parts and to comprise a base plate, with a through-passage for fastening the base plate on the leash, and the actual closure part, which is secured on the base plate via an articulation and, furthermore, is equipped with two different locking sections for different motor-vehicle seat belt locks, with the result that the application area of the leashes is further increased to a considerable extent.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the case of a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the carabiner hook is spaced apart from the closure part by a distance which corresponds to that of a motor-vehicle seat belt lock and the collar or harness of an animal sitting or lying on a seat, or an area provided for this purpose, in a motor vehicle, with the result that it is also possible, if desired, for the room for movement for an animal in a motor vehicle to be significantly reduced. It is also advantageously possible to adjust this distance via the graduated length of the leash, which can be produced by engaging the carabiner hook into different eyelets of the leash.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The leash may also be configured as a long leash or as a short leash, the retaining loop, in the latter case, being arranged directly behind the closure part, with the result that a person can guide his/her hand through the retaining loop and can then grip the handgrip, a dimensionally stable and ergonomic retaining device being produced as a result.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thereof, there is shown a leash or lead <b>1</b> that comprises a strap <b>12</b> or belt, preferably made of leather or a braided plastic, and has, at the top end, either a prefabricated retaining loop <b>2</b> or a retaining loop <b>22</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which can be produced by engaging a snap hook or carabiner hook <b>21</b> in eyelets <b>15</b>; <b>16</b>; <b>17</b> of the leash <b>1</b>. The leash <b>1</b> further has a snap hook or carabiner hook <b>11</b> at a bottom end, and also adjusting clasps <b>13</b>, via which the length of the leash <b>1</b> can be adapted as desired. The snap hooks or carabiner hooks described and shown herein are but exemplary attachment devices and it will be understood that several equivalent attachment devices may be available.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The embodiment of the leash <b>1</b> which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> is designed as a short leash. In the region directly behind the retaining loop <b>2</b>, it has a handgrip <b>3</b>, which comprises a sheath <b>4</b> in which is formed a closure part <b>7</b> which has a through-passage <b>14</b>, through which the strap or the belt of the leash <b>1</b> extends and is secured by transverse seams provided therein. Arranged at that end of the closure part <b>7</b> which is opposite to the through-passage <b>14</b> is a locking section <b>10</b> similar to a seat belt buckle. The locking section can be introduced into a large number of conventional motor vehicle seat belt buckle receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A closure part as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has a base plate <b>8</b>, with a through-passage <b>14</b>, and an articulation <b>6</b>, via which two locking sections <b>9</b>; <b>10</b> of the closure part <b>7</b> can optionally be rotated into an operational position, with the result that, with this type of closure part, it is possible to utilize all common seat belt locks for strapping an animal in a motor vehicle using a seat belt.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is also possible for a leash <b>1</b> to be designed as long leash and to be provided with a second snap hook or carabiner hook <b>21</b> and with different eyelets <b>15</b>; <b>16</b>; <b>17</b> over the length of the leash <b>1</b>, it being possible for an eyelet <b>15</b> to be disposed, for example, in front of the handgrip <b>3</b>, for an eyelet to be spaced apart behind the handgrip <b>3</b> and for an eyelet <b>17</b> to be arranged in the end region of the leash <b>1</b>, with the result that engaging the carabiner hook <b>21</b> into the first eyelet <b>15</b> gives a prefabricated retaining loop in a form similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and, for example, engaging the carabiner hook <b>21</b> into the last eyelet <b>17</b> of the leash <b>1</b> gives a vastly shortened leash <b>1</b> with a retaining loop <b>22</b> through which a hand can likewise be guided before the handgrip <b>3</b> is gripped, with the result that the user can choose the use position which is most comfortable or seems to be most expedient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sheath <b>4</b> of the handgrip <b>3</b> preferably has a hook-and-loop fastener <b>5</b>, such as mating Velcro&#xae; strips. The fasteners <b>5</b> allow the sheath <b>4</b> to be easily fastened around the closure part <b>7</b> enclosing the rigid core of the handgrip <b>3</b> or the closure part <b>7</b> connected to the base plate <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A leash <b>30</b> that is constructed according to a second preferred embodiment of the invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. Leash <b>30</b> includes an elongated strap or belt <b>32</b> that is connected to a snap hook or carabiner hook <b>11</b> at a first end and to a retaining loop <b>34</b> at a second, opposite end. In the preferred embodiment, the preferred total length of the leash <b>30</b> is preferably within a range of about 4 feet to about 9 feet. As in the previously described embodiment, at least one adjusting clasp <b>13</b> is provided for adjusting the length of the leash <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, a first sheath <b>36</b> is provided and is secured to the strap or belt <b>32</b> at a location that is substantially intermediate between the first and second ends of the strap or belt <b>32</b>, and a second sheath <b>38</b> is secured at a location that is proximate to the retaining loop <b>34</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it will be seen that the first sheath <b>36</b> preferably includes a flexible web <b>40</b> material preferably having more than one ply and that preferably includes an internal padding material. A fastener that is preferably a hook and loop type fastener <b>42</b> is provided so that the flexible web <b>40</b> can be folded and secured in position over itself and over the elongated strap or belt <b>32</b> in the configuration that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A locking part <b>44</b> that is shaped so as to be releasably securable to an automobile seat belt buckle is secured with respect to the strap or belt <b>32</b> and the first sheath <b>36</b>. The flexible web <b>40</b> is sized and shaped so that it will wrap around and provide cushioning and protection to the locking part <b>44</b> when the locking part <b>44</b> is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it will be seen that the second sheath <b>38</b> is also preferably fabricated from a multi-ply, preferably padded flexible web <b>46</b> that is similarly provided with a fastener that is preferably a hook and loop type fastener <b>48</b>. According to one advantageous feature of the invention, a storage pocket <b>50</b> is preferably defined within the flexible web <b>46</b>, and a zipper closure <b>52</b> having a pull-tab <b>54</b> is preferably provided to access and close the storage pocket <b>50</b>. Storage pocket <b>50</b> is preferably sized so as to be capable of storing articles such as personal effects like keys, credit cards and identification cards, and/or pet care articles such as waste bags for pet cleanup. Alternatively, a different type of closure such as a hook and loop type fastener closure could be provided in lieu of the zipper closure <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A leash <b>60</b> that is constructed according to a third preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 11</figref>. Leash <b>60</b> has an elongated strap or belt <b>63</b> having a first end that is connected to a snap hook or carabiner hook <b>11</b> and a second end that is configured as a retaining loop <b>62</b>. Leash <b>60</b> preferably has a total length that is within a range of about 3 feet to about 7 feet, and is provided with at least one adjusting clasp <b>13</b> for adjusting the overall length. A sheath <b>64</b> is preferably secured to the elongated strap or belt <b>63</b> and, as is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, is preferably fabricated from a flexible web material <b>66</b> that has more than one ply and that is preferably padded. A fastener that is preferably a hook and loop type fastener <b>68</b> is provided to enable the flexible web material <b>66</b> to be folded over itself into the configuration that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A locking part <b>70</b> that is shaped so as to be releasably securable to an automobile seat belt buckle is secured with respect to the strap or belt <b>63</b> and the sheath <b>64</b>. The flexible web material <b>66</b> is preferably sized and shaped so that it will wrap around and provide cushioning and protection to the locking part <b>70</b> when the locking part <b>70</b> is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, an internal storage pocket <b>72</b> is preferably defined within the flexible web material <b>66</b>, and a zipper closure <b>74</b> having a pull tab <b>76</b> is preferably provided to access and close the storage pocket <b>72</b>.
