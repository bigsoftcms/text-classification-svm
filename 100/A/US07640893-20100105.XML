<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to grooming tools for animals, and in particular to brushes and combs for removing loose animal hair or fur.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Keeping an animal healthy and clean includes grooming their fur to remove loose hairs and debris. Various combs and brushes have been marketed that do well in one situation or the other. Richard Gordon describes a grooming comb for pets in U.S. Pat. No. 4,799,457, issued Jan. 24, 1989. It comprises a combined shredding and grooming tool made from a strip of plastic with two different types of comb teeth on its edges, and handles on opposite ends.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Frederick Eckert describes a grooming element in U.S. Pat. No. 1,285,957, issued Nov. 26, 1918. A brush with a handle is provided that is said to be especially good at removing mud and dirt from the legs of draft animals. Several parallel even loops of wire are each anchored at both ends and bow out from a backing board. The wire loops are drug crosswise across the dirt to be brushed off.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hugo Ewart describes a currycomb in U.S. Pat. No. 753,056, issued Feb. 23, 1904, that is essentially made entirely from wire. A brush arrangement is made by twisting rows of wire to form loops that act like teeth or bristles. Several rows of these are set in parallel and a wire-formed handle is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another currycomb or card cleaner is described by Charles Flanders in U.S. Pat. No. 717,377, issued Dec. 30, 1902. Here, a snap-on grille is placed over the bristles of a brush. When the bristles load up with hair, the hair is easily removed by removing the grille.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A linked chain-mail wire material is wrapped around the drum of a brush and handle to form a round currycomb brush in U.S. Pat. No. 681,707, issued Sep. 3, 1901, to James Johnson. The rounded teeth-like projections of the interlinked parallel coils of wire do not get clogged and are easily cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">William Cole describes a horse cleaner brush in U.S. Pat. No. 463,942, issued Nov. 24, 1891. A round handle supports a cylindrical frame over which several parallel straight wires are longitudinally strung. The strings resemble those of a violin, but wrap around the entire circumference over a grooved head at the end opposite to the handle. The string tension is made adjustable to make the wires taut.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Orlando Jenness describes a curry comb in a flat brush arrangement with a handle in U.S. Pat. No. 360,301, issued Mar. 29, 1887. Several strands of twisted ribbons of metal are arranged in parallel above a box-like frame and backer board. These &#x201c;bars&#x201d; are traversely dragged across an animal's fur to clean and groom it. The resulting comb is said to control dust and provide a very long service life.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a bush that grooms animals quickly and efficiently, and that is easy to clean and use again.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention includes an animal grooming tool, made in accord with the invention, in which a plurality of latex surgical tubing pieces generally arranged in parallel to one another, and anchored as a group at corresponding opposite ends, and a handle providing for a user to draw the plurality of latex surgical tubing pieces across an animal for grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the present invention comprises a number natural rubber latex surgical tubing strung in parallel between rotatable matching disks or arms. The tubing arrangements can be parallel in a plane, or in a cylinder. The rotating parts are mounted to a handle to allow the brushing action on an animal to cause the rotation. The surgical tubing stretches and grips during use and clings to loose hairs and debris. An auxiliary comb with graduated teeth spacing is provided to assist with grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An advantage of the present invention is a grooming tool is provided that is effective and easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another advantage of the present invention is a grooming tool is provided that can be used for massage and improving blood circulation in the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further advantage of the present invention is a grooming tool is provided that is easy to clean of hair.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above summary of the present invention is not intended to represent each disclosed embodiment, or every aspect, of the present invention. Other aspects and example embodiments are provided in the figures and the detailed description that follow.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the present invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the present invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, the invention includes an animal grooming tool with a plurality of latex surgical tubing pieces generally arranged in parallel to one another, and anchored as a group at corresponding opposite ends. Preferred embodiments also include a handle providing for a user to draw the plurality of latex surgical tubing pieces across an animal for grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a grooming tool embodiment of the present invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral <b>100</b>. The grooming tool <b>100</b> may be used as a brush and comb to groom animals. It comprises several pieces of latex surgical tubing <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> strung between rotatable disks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. These turn like a drum on two arms <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> attached to a shaft <b>112</b>. A comb <b>114</b> is mounted on the back of shaft <b>112</b> and spaces some of its teeth farther apart on one end than the other. The user can then choose which part of the tool is best to use when encountering different types or hair, fur, and dirt. A handle <b>116</b> is provided for comfortable use.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The use of latex surgical tubing <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> is critical to the present invention. The material properties of natural rubber latex provide a combination of adhesion and flexibility that is very efficient in grooming when allowed to rotate in an assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Silicone tubing may be a useful alternative, but such may not cling to hair so well. Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, three pieces of latex tubing <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> are visible, but four or more pieces can also be used. A prototype that worked well used four pieces of &#x215c;&#x2033; ID latex tubing arranged in a circle about 1.5&#x2033; in diameter. That provided about &#xbe;&#x2033; between adjacent pieces. During use, the pieces <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> while rotating and being pressed against the animal can be drawn closer together. There may be an advantage to make the tubing a bit longer than is necessary to bridge the distance between disks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Such prototype spaced the disks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> about 5-6&#x2033; apart. The materials used for the rest of the construction are conventional, e.g., ordinary plastics, metals, or wood.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents brush embodiment of the present invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral <b>200</b>. The brush <b>200</b> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but has no comb and a simpler handle. Brush <b>200</b> also has several pieces of latex surgical tubing <b>201</b>-<b>203</b> strung between rotatable disks <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>. These turn together as a drum assembly <b>208</b> spindled to a handle <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a detailed view of a disk <b>300</b> similar to disks <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 and 104</figref> and <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each piece of surgical tubing is connected to a nipple <b>301</b>-<b>304</b>, e.g., &#x215c;&#x2033; in diameter and in length. A center hole <b>306</b> provides for an axle, e.g., a simple shaft with machine screws and nuts snugged tight enough to allow rotation without wobbling. These are all disposed on an end plate <b>308</b>. In an alternative embodiment, assembly <b>208</b> does not rotate on handle <b>210</b>, the user simply allows the whole brush to roll over the animal's fir during grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents another brush embodiment of the present invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral <b>400</b>. The brush <b>400</b> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but has flat arrangement. Brush <b>400</b> also has four pieces of latex surgical tubing <b>401</b>-<b>404</b> strung between rotatable stretchers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b>. These turn together as a drum assembly <b>410</b> spindled in tandem to handles <b>412</b>-<b>413</b>. Two hands can be used with the two handles <b>412</b>-<b>413</b> to apply more pressure than could be comfortably applied with one hand using only a single handle <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Such spindle may be best if the latex surgical tubing <b>401</b>-<b>404</b> strung between rotatable stretchers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> are allowed to be a bit floppy or loose. It may also be advantageous for the spindle arrangement to the rotatable stretchers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> to be locked together.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Four pieces of latex surgical tubing <b>401</b>-<b>404</b> are shown here in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> being strung between rotatable stretchers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b>, but the best number of tubings, tubing size and tubing lengths will depend on the particular application. In an alternative embodiment, assembly <b>410</b> does not rotate on handle <b>412</b>, or handles <b>412</b>-<b>413</b>, the user simply allows the whole brush <b>400</b> to occasionally fold or flop over the animal's fur during grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a detailed view of a rotatable stretcher <b>500</b> similar to rotatable stretchers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Each piece of surgical tubing is connected to a nipple <b>501</b>-<b>504</b>, e.g., &#x215c;&#x2033; in diameter and in length. A typical length would be about six inches. A center hole <b>506</b> provides for an axle, e.g., a simple shaft with machine screws and nuts snugged tight enough to allow rotation. These are all disposed on an end plate <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flat brush embodiment of the present invention, and is referred to herein by the general reference numeral <b>600</b>. Brush <b>600</b> uses the arrangement of several surgical tube pieces <b>601</b>-<b>604</b> all of equal length. There may be some advantage in particular applications to not keeping the surgical tube pieces <b>601</b>-<b>604</b> all of equal length. Here, each can spin on a corresponding axis <b>605</b>-<b>608</b>, either as a gang or individually, depending on application. End plates <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> provide axle support and attack to a backing plate <b>614</b>. A handle <b>616</b> allows the user to draw the brush across an animal's fur for grooming.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Many arrangements of surgical tubing are possible that would be useful in grooming. For example, a frame something like an empty tennis racket strung with a coil of surgical tubing with parallel windings between the frame perimeters may work and be inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Silicone tubing has a better deterioration rate but it is surpassed by latex surgical tubing in elasticity, flexibility and gripping power. Latex surgical tubing is flexible in sub-zero temperatures, maintains memory after repeated stretching, and has tremendous holding strength adhesiveness. Latex surgical tubing comes in black or amber, here is no difference in the properties of colors. Latex products are manufactured from a milky fluid derived from the rubber tree, <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>. Several chemicals are added to this fluid during the processing and manufacture of commercial latex. Some individuals are allergic to latex contact, and an alternative rubber-like material may be better in some uses.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the present invention has been described with reference to several particular example embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims.</p>
