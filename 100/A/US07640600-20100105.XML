<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/888,410 filed on Feb. 6, 2007.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This description relates generally to the area of nursing and more specifically to a nursing cover.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is important to the bonding process between mother and child that mothers breastfeed their infants. However, societal norms generally discourage breastfeeding in public without covering the mother's exposed breast. To accommodate this societal norm, most nursing mothers elect to cover both their exposed breast and the nursing infant with a blanket draped over one shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the draped blanket accomplishes the task of covering the mother's exposed breast, it detracts from the bonding process between the mother and child, as the nursing infant and mother are unable to easily look at each other and thus bond.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is an apparatus that allows the child to nurse while both covering the mother's breast and allowing the mother and child to view each other during the nursing process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is described is a sash-style apparatus that can be comprised of two strips of material. The two strips of material can be configured such that in one configuration the first strip of material lies substantially behind the second strip of material and in a second configuration, the two strips of material can be minimally parted to reveal the mother's nipple and allow an infant to breastfeed. In some embodiments, the two strips of material can be bonded together in at least one location and can include a selectively couplable or permanently coupled burping cloth which can be positioned on the shoulder of the nursing mother. Thus, in use, the mother can breastfeed her infant without covering the child's face or head and can immediately burp the child over her shoulder without having to concern herself with re-covering her breast after nursing the infant.</p>

Complementary fastening components <b>614</b> can be hook and loop, snaps, button and slit, or any other known and/or convenient fastening components.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, a nursing mother can prepare her breast for a nursing infant by exposing her breast behind strips <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Then the nursing mother can expose her nipple between an interior strip <b>104</b> and an exterior strip <b>106</b> such that the infant can begin nursing and without substantially exposing her breast and while still allowing the mother and child to bond during the nursing process (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). When the infant is finished nursing the mother can easily reconfigure the strips <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> such that her nipple is covered and immediately begin to burp the infant over her shoulder, which is covered by a shoulder support <b>102</b> and/or detachable cover <b>108</b> and/or burping cover <b>202</b>. When nursing and/or burping is completed, the mother can re-clothe herself beneath strips <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and, if desired, reconfigure the strips to be substantially overlapping and/or, if necessary and/or desired, replace a detachable cover <b>108</b> and/or burping cover <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the invention as described and hereinafter claimed is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.</p>
