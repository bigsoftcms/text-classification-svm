<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to floating platform and draper-type headers for agricultural combines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An agricultural combine is a large machine used to harvest a variety of crops from a field. During a harvesting operation, a header at the front of the combine cuts ripened crop from the field. A feederhouse supporting the header transfers the crop material into the combine. Threshing and separating assemblies within the combine remove grain from the crop material and transfer the clean grain to a grain tank for temporary holding. Crop material other than grain exits from the rear of the combine. An unloading auger transfers the clean grain from the grain tank to a truck or grain cart for transport, or to another receiving bin for holding.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Draper headers are header types commonly used when harvesting crops such as small grains, peas, lentils, and rice. Such draper headers comprise a cutter bar and two or more conveying transversely moving belts arranged in a forward direction behind the cutter bar that convey the cut crop towards the center of the header, where it is fed towards the rear by another conveyor belt assembly that feeds the crop towards a rear outlet of the header and to a feederhouse of the combine. During a harvesting operation with this header type, it is desirable to maintain a cutting height as low as possible to the ground in order to collect substantially the entire ripe crop from the field. To accomplish this, combines typically employ a header float system or a terrain following system to enable the header to follow the ground over changing terrain without gouging or digging into the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,717,995, 3,623,304, and 4,724,661 disclose examples of header float systems using resilient structures to suspend the header, thereby reducing the apparent weight of the header, allowing it to lightly skid across the ground over changing terrain. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,597,907, 4,622,803 and 5,471,823 disclose examples of similar float systems, but using dynamic structures to suspend the header. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,577,373, 6,041,583 and 6,758,029 B2 disclose examples of terrain following systems using dynamic structures to position the header, thereby sensing and changing the vertical position of the header to follow changing terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such float systems allow for independent movement of rollers supporting the belt in a vertical direction, such that they can follow the ground contours closely. As a result, problems occur in guiding the belt properly over the roller, since both rollers at the two ends of the belt may move by different distances and even in different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Published patent application US 2005/022491 describes a platform header for a combine with a rigid frame, a cutter bar and three belts arranged side by side for conveying the crop rearward to a transverse auger. The belts comprise at their lateral ends inwardly extending wedges neighboring the side walls of the deflection rollers, in order to prevent the belt from running off the rollers. Published patent application US 2006/254241 A describes a similar platform header in which cover plates between adjacent belts are located in lower positions as the lateral end of the belt, in order to prevent crop or residues from entering between the cover and the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed in the art is a draper header with belts conveying the crop in a transverse direction, allowing appropriate guidance of the belts also when rollers independently move in a vertical direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A draper platform includes a frame, a cutter bar, at least one conveyor assembly with two rollers and a conveyor belt surrounding both rollers. Each of the rollers are mounted to a respective support frame that is independently pivotally mounted to the frame around a transverse axis at its rear end. An assembly for guiding the conveyor belt on the rollers is provided. It includes a ridge on an interior side of the conveyor belt and a groove within the roller. The ridge and the groove are provided in the vicinity of the rear end of the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other aspects of the invention are directed towards the conveyor belt per se and towards the assembly for guiding the conveyor belt on the rollers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a self-propelled combine <b>10</b> commonly used in a grain farming operation to harvest a variety of crops from a field. An onboard engine (not shown) powers the combine <b>10</b>, while ground engaging wheels <b>14</b> support and propel the machine. An operator controls the combine <b>10</b> from an operator's station located in a cab <b>16</b> at the front of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A feederhouse <b>20</b> pivotally attaches at the front of the combine <b>10</b>, supporting a header <b>22</b> removably attached to the front of the feederhouse <b>20</b>. A pair of lift cylinders <b>24</b> support and articulate the feederhouse <b>20</b> from the combine <b>10</b>, enabling the raising and lowering of the header <b>22</b> relative to the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During a harvesting operation, the combine <b>10</b> moves forward through the field with the header <b>22</b> lowered to a working height. The header <b>22</b> cuts and transfers crop material to the feederhouse <b>20</b>, which in turn transfers the crop material into the combine <b>10</b>. Once inside the combine, threshing and separating assemblies <b>26</b> remove grain from the non-grain crop material and transfer it to a grain tank <b>28</b> for temporary holding. Crop material other than grain exits from the rear of the combine <b>10</b>. An unloading auger <b>30</b> transfers the grain from the grain tank <b>28</b> to a truck or grain cart for transport, or to another receiving bin for holding. In the following, all references to directions are quoted with respect to the forward direction of combine <b>10</b> which extends in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the left side.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a perspective view of the header <b>22</b>, which is a draper type header and includes a frame <b>32</b> supporting a cutter bar <b>34</b> extending over the entire width of header <b>22</b>, a first transverse conveyor belt assembly <b>36</b>, a second transverse conveyor belt assembly <b>38</b>, a third transverse conveyor belt assembly <b>40</b>, a fourth transverse conveyor belt assembly <b>42</b> and a fifth conveyor belt assembly <b>44</b>. While during operation, the first and second conveyor belt assemblies <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> convey the crop cut by the cutter bar <b>34</b> to the left and thus towards the center of header <b>22</b>, the third and fourth conveyor belt assemblies <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> convey the crop cut by the cutter bar <b>34</b> to the right and thus towards the center of header <b>22</b>, where it is fed by the fifth conveyor belt assembly <b>44</b> and an upper transverse drum conveyor <b>48</b> with outwardly extending fingers towards a rear exit opening <b>46</b> of frame <b>32</b> and thus to the feederhouse <b>20</b>. A reel assembly <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also supported on frame <b>32</b> and moves crop standing on the field towards the cutter bar <b>34</b>. The frame <b>32</b> comprises vertically extending rear cover sheets <b>52</b> mounted behind the conveyor belt assemblies <b>36</b>-<b>42</b>, and side walls <b>54</b> at both ends.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the frame <b>32</b> includes a transverse, cylindrical beam <b>56</b> with a circular cross section. Beam <b>56</b> extends outward from the center portion of the frame of the header <b>22</b>. The rear cover sheets <b>52</b> and the side walls <b>54</b> are directly mounted to beam <b>56</b>, which is supported on the feederhouse <b>20</b> by a supporting assembly <b>62</b> supporting beam <b>56</b> on top of the front portion of the feederhouse <b>20</b>. The beam <b>56</b> further supports a number of forwardly extending support frames <b>58</b> distributed over the width of beam <b>56</b>. The support frames <b>58</b> are pivotally mounted to the beam <b>56</b> around the longitudinal axis <b>78</b> of beam <b>56</b> by way of rings <b>60</b> enclosing beam <b>56</b>. The rings <b>60</b> are mounted to a respective support frame <b>58</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. By suitable stops (not shown), the angular range that the support frames <b>58</b> can rotate around beam <b>56</b> can be restricted. The support frames <b>58</b> carry on their front ends the cutter bar <b>34</b> as well as lower ground engaging skids <b>64</b> and upper crop guides <b>66</b> having a vertical front wall and an upper, horizontal wall extending towards the rear beyond the front edges of the conveyor belt assemblies <b>36</b>-<b>42</b>. The right half of the frame <b>32</b> of header <b>22</b> comprises in total eight support frames <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The outermost support frame <b>58</b> mounts a roller <b>68</b>, while the two succeeding support frames <b>58</b> mount stabilization rods <b>70</b>. The next (fourth seen from the right end) support frame <b>58</b> mounts two rollers <b>68</b>, while the three succeeding support frames <b>58</b> also mount stabilization rods <b>70</b>. The two rollers <b>68</b> of the fourth support frame <b>58</b> are connected by way of a gearbox <b>74</b> to a hydraulic motor <b>76</b> driving the two rollers <b>68</b>. The innermost support frame <b>58</b> finally bears a roller <b>68</b>. The conveyor belt assembly <b>44</b> is also supported on the innermost support frame <b>58</b>, although it might also be independently mounted to beam <b>56</b>. A first conveyor belt <b>72</b> of the first belt assembly <b>36</b> runs around the roller <b>68</b> mounted to the rightmost support frame <b>58</b> and around the outer roller <b>68</b> mounted to the fourth (seen from the right end of header <b>22</b>) support frame <b>58</b>, while a conveyor belt <b>72</b> of the second belt assembly <b>38</b> runs around the other roller <b>68</b> of this support frame <b>58</b> and around the roller <b>68</b> of the innermost support frame <b>58</b>. The conveyor belts <b>72</b> also enclose the telescopic stabilization rods <b>70</b> mounted on the remaining support frames <b>58</b>. The conveyor belts <b>72</b> include transverse flights. The left half of the header <b>22</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) is arranged symmetric to its right half.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">After all, it is apparent that the support frames <b>58</b> can individually move in a vertical direction around the longitudinal axis <b>78</b> of the beam <b>56</b>, dependent on the ground contour. Possible end positions of the support frames <b>58</b> and of the rollers <b>68</b> are schematically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Since both rollers <b>68</b>, around which a conveyor belt <b>72</b> runs, can move independently, an assembly <b>80</b> for guiding the conveyor belt <b>72</b> on the rollers <b>68</b> is provided, that prevents the conveyor belt <b>72</b> from running off the rollers <b>68</b>. This assembly <b>80</b> for guiding the conveyor belt <b>72</b> on the rollers <b>68</b> includes a recess or groove <b>82</b> within the rollers <b>68</b> and a ridge <b>84</b> on the inner face of the conveyor belt <b>72</b>, engaging into the groove <b>82</b>. The assembly <b>80</b> for guiding the conveyor belt <b>72</b> on the rollers <b>68</b> is located at about &#x2155; of the length of the roller <b>68</b> in the vicinity of its rear end. This location has the advantage of being relatively close to the rotation axis <b>78</b> and thus having only a limited vertical movement range, such that the assemblies <b>80</b> of both rollers <b>68</b> supporting one conveyor belt <b>72</b> have a sufficiently small relative movement range, thereby avoiding that the conveyor belt <b>72</b> runs off the rollers <b>68</b>, and also providing a flange <b>86</b> extending horizontally and forwardly from the lower edge of the rear cover sheets <b>52</b> and abutting the inner surface of the conveyor belt <b>72</b> over a sufficient length to prevent entry of crop and residues into the interior of the belt assemblies <b>36</b>-<b>42</b>. The flanges <b>86</b> have cutouts <b>88</b> in the area of the rollers <b>68</b>. While they are only indicated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the flanges <b>86</b> extend forward to the ridge <b>84</b> of the conveyor belt <b>72</b>, such that the ridge <b>84</b> abuts a vertical end range <b>90</b> of the flange <b>86</b>, preventing entry of crop and residue into the interior of the belt assemblies <b>36</b>-<b>42</b>. Since the conveyor belts <b>72</b> move relative to axis <b>78</b>, while the rear cover sheets <b>52</b> and the flanges <b>86</b> are rigidly mounted to frame <b>32</b>, the flanges <b>86</b> have a convex curved upper surface, allowing a continuous contact with the interior of the conveyor belt <b>72</b>.</p>
