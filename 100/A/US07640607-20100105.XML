<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This application relates generally to patient support systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various systems and methods exist to provide radiation therapy treatment of tumorous tissue with high-energy radiation. While some patient conditions require whole body radiation treatments, many forms of radiation treatment benefit from the ability to accurately control the amount, location and distribution of radiation within a patient's body. Such control often includes applying various levels of radiation to various areas of the tumorous region. For example, in some instances it is desirable to apply a greater dosage of radiation to one portion of a tumorous region than another. As another example, in some instances it is desirable to minimize the dosage of radiation to non tumorous regions where radiation may have deleterious effects. Due to a variety of contributing factors, achieving accurate control of the amount, location and distribution of radiation within the patient's body can be difficult. Among these factors are movement in the patient's body, changes in organ or inter organ structure or composition, and changes in the relative position of a patient's organs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior to a radiation therapy, the patient undergoes an imaging procedure to determine the exact size, shape and location of the tumorous region. In a radiation treatment session, the patient is subjected to radiation from an accelerator that emits a beam of radiation energy collimated and oriented to enter the patient's body from a particular angle. Varying the intensity and the entry angle of the incident radiation beam allows a radiation specialist to generate a radiation dose volume that corresponds to the size, shape, and location of the tumorous region.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several factors may prevent optimal radiation exposure to the tumorous region and minimal radiation exposure of the healthy tissue regions. For example, minor changes in patient's position from the imaging device to the treatment device may radically alter the position of the tumorous region or organ. In existing procedures, the patient is generally placed on a first patient support when the imaging device is used to obtain images of the patient. After the imaging session, the patient is then moved to a second patient support where the patient can be treated in a treatment session. As a result of moving the patient to different supports, the position and/or the shape of the target tissue within the patient may change. As such, it may be desirable to provide a patient support system that is capable of supporting a patient during an imaging procedure and/or treatment session.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem associated with existing patient support systems is that they have limited range of movements and limited degrees of freedom. For example, in certain procedures, it may be desirable to rotate a patient support about its longitudinal axis to thereby tilt the patient support. However, existing patient support systems may not be configured to allow rotation of the patient support about its longitudinal axis.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Various embodiments are described hereinafter with reference to the figures. It should be noted that the figures are not drawn to scale and elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of specific embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the invention or as a limitation on the scope of the invention. In addition, an aspect described in conjunction with a particular embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments. Moreover, alternative configurations, components, methods, etc. discussed in conjunction with one embodiment can be used in any other embodiment even if such other embodiment does not discuss such alternatives or discusses different alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a radiation system <b>10</b> in accordance with some embodiments. The radiation system <b>10</b> includes a structure <b>12</b> having a first side <b>14</b>, a second side <b>16</b>, a first opening <b>18</b> located on the first side <b>14</b>, a second opening <b>20</b> located on the second side <b>16</b>, and a bore <b>22</b> extending between the first and second openings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the openings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are circular in shape and are sized for accommodating at least a part of a patient. In other embodiments, the openings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can have other shapes. The through bore <b>22</b> of the structure <b>12</b> provides a passage for allowing at least a portion of a patient to be transported from one side of the structure <b>12</b> to an opposite side of the structure <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, a diagnostic procedure (e.g., an imaging procedure) is performed on the patient on one side of the structure <b>12</b> (e.g., for the purpose of obtaining information, such as a position of a target region, of the patient), and the patient is then transported through the bore <b>22</b> to the opposite side of the structure <b>12</b> for a treatment procedure. In other embodiments, the patient is treated on one side of the structure <b>12</b>, and is then transported through the bore <b>22</b> to the opposite side of the structure <b>12</b> for further procedure(s), such as a diagnostic procedure (e.g., to evaluate a treatment procedure, or to verify location, orientation, and/or shape of a target tissue,) or a treatment procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be noted that the shape and configuration of the structure <b>12</b> should not be limited to the examples discussed previously, and that the structure <b>12</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, the structure <b>12</b> can have a curvilinear shape, or other shapes. Also, in some embodiments, the structure <b>12</b> can have a size and shape such that the structure can house mechanical and electrical components associated with an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The radiation system <b>10</b> also includes a first radiation source <b>40</b> located adjacent to the first side <b>14</b> for delivering a radiation beam <b>42</b>. The radiation beam <b>42</b> can be a pencil beam, a fan beam, a cone beam, or other types of beams having different configurations. As used in this specification, the term &#x201c;radiation source&#x201d; refers to an emission point/region of a radiation beam (e.g., radiation beam <b>42</b>), and may or may not include components, such as a particle generator, an accelerator, a cooling system, a shielding, etc., that are used to generate the radiation beam <b>42</b>. As shown in the figure, the radiation system <b>10</b> includes an arm <b>30</b> secured to the structure <b>12</b>, and the first radiation source <b>40</b> is secured to the arm <b>30</b>. Some or all of the components used to generate the radiation beam <b>42</b> can be housed within the arm <b>30</b>, the structure <b>12</b>, a separate housing (not shown), or combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the accelerator <b>31</b> associated with the radiation source <b>40</b> may be housed within the arm <b>30</b>. In such cases, one or more magnets (electromagnet(s) or permanent magnet(s)) may be provided within the arm <b>30</b> for changing a characteristic (e.g., a trajectory) of an electron beam created by the accelerator <b>31</b>. If permanent magnet(s) is used, its associated magnetic field can be trimmed electromagnetically (e.g., using one or more electromagnetic coil(s)) or mechanically (e.g., using one or more permanent magnet(s)). Also, in some embodiments, the mechanical trimming can be performed using a magnetic shunt. Magnetic field trimming will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in the figure, the arm <b>30</b> is secured to a mechanical linkage <b>44</b>, such as a ring, that is rotatable relative to the structure <b>12</b>, thereby allowing the first radiation source <b>40</b> to rotate about an axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b>. The arm <b>30</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b> is advantageous in that it allows radiation be delivered to a portion of a patient that is placed outside the bore <b>22</b>. In particular, since the patient is not confined by the bore <b>22</b>, the patient can be oriented at different angles relative to the axis <b>46</b> outside the bore <b>22</b>. For example, the patient can be positioned at least partially outside the bore <b>22</b> and oriented at an angle relative to the axis <b>46</b>. In some embodiments, the arm <b>30</b> is also advantageous in that it can be used to house at least some of the components, such as an accelerator, associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>, thereby eliminating the need to cramp the components within the bore <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In other embodiments, or any of the embodiments described herein, the radiation system <b>10</b> may not include the arm <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>). In such cases, the first radiation source <b>40</b> may be rotatably secured to the structure <b>12</b>. For example, the radiation source <b>40</b> may be secured to a ring (which may be a full ring or a partial ring) that is rotatable relative to the structure <b>12</b> in a slip-ring configuration. In such cases, at least some of the components within arm <b>30</b> may be disposed within the structure <b>12</b>. It should be noted that any one or a combination of any of the features described herein may be incorporated and implemented with the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, and that a configuration where a radiation source such as source <b>40</b> is within a ring can be incorporated and implemented in any embodiments such as those illustrated or described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the illustrated embodiments, the first radiation source <b>40</b> is a treatment radiation source for providing treatment energy. In such cases, the radiation system <b>10</b> further includes one or more collimators (not shown) for controlling a delivery of the radiation beam <b>42</b> (e.g., changing a shape of the beam <b>42</b>). A collimator can be, for example, a multi-leaf collimator, which is known in the art. Alternatively, the first radiation source <b>40</b> can be a diagnostic radiation source for providing diagnostic energy. In some embodiments, the treatment energy is generally those energies of 160 keV or greater, and more typically 1 MeV or greater, and diagnostic energy is generally those energies below the high energy range, and more typically below 160 keV. In other embodiments, the treatment energy and the diagnostic energy can have other energy levels, and refer to energies that are used for treatment and diagnostic purposes, respectively. For example, a radiation beam having an energy level that is, typically used for treatment purpose may be considered as having a diagnostic energy level if the radiation beam is used for diagnostic purpose (e.g., for imaging). As such, the term &#x201c;treatment energy&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;diagnostic energy&#x201d; should not be limited to energy levels having certain magnitudes. In further embodiments, the first radiation source <b>40</b> is a multi-energy x-ray source that is capable of providing radiation energy at different energy levels. By way of example, the first radiation source <b>40</b> is able to generate X-ray radiation at a plurality of photon energy levels within a range anywhere between approximately 10 kilo-electron-volts (keV) and approximately 20 mega-electron-volts (MeV). Radiation sources capable of generating X-ray radiation at different energy levels are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/033,327, entitled &#x201c;RADIOTHERAPY APPARATUS EQUIPPED WITH AN ARTICULABLE GANTRY FOR POSITIONING AN IMAGING UNIT,&#x201d; filed on Nov. 2, 2001, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/687,573, entitled &#x201c;MULTI-ENERGY X-RAY SOURCE,&#x201d; filed on Oct. 15, 2003, both of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> further includes a control system <b>78</b>. The control system <b>78</b> includes a processor <b>84</b>, such as a computer processor, coupled to a control <b>80</b>. The control system <b>78</b> may also include a monitor <b>86</b> for displaying data and an input device <b>88</b>, such as a keyboard or a mouse, for inputting data. In some embodiments, during an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b>, the radiation source <b>40</b> rotates about the patient (e.g., as in an arc-therapy). The rotation and the operation of the radiation source <b>40</b> are controlled by the control <b>80</b>, which provides power and timing signals to the radiation source <b>40</b> and controls a rotational speed and position of the radiation source <b>40</b> based on signals received from the processor <b>84</b>. Although the control <b>80</b> is shown as a separate component from the structure <b>12</b> and the processor <b>84</b>, in alternative embodiments, the control <b>80</b> can be a part of the structure <b>12</b> or the processor <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In any of the embodiments described herein, the radiation system <b>10</b> can further include an imager <b>50</b> located next to the first opening <b>18</b> and opposite from the radiation source <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In some embodiments, the imager <b>50</b> includes a conversion layer made from a scintillator element, such as Cesium Iodide (CsI), and a photo detector array (e.g., a photodiode layer) coupled to the conversion layer. The conversion layer generates light photons in response to radiation, and the photo detector array, which includes a plurality of detector elements, is configured to generate electrical signal in response to the light photons from the conversion layer. The imager <b>50</b> can have a curvilinear surface (e.g., a partial circular arc). Such configuration is beneficial in that each of the imaging elements of the imager <b>50</b> is located substantially the same distance from the radiation source <b>40</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the imager <b>50</b> may have a rectilinear surface or a surface having other profiles. The imager <b>50</b> can be made from amorphous silicon, crystal and silicon wafers, crystal and silicon substrate, or flexible substrate (e.g., plastic), and may be constructed using flat panel technologies or other techniques known in the art of making imaging device. In alternative embodiments, the imager <b>50</b> may use different detection schemes. For example, in alternative embodiments, instead of having the conversion layer, the imager <b>50</b> may include a photoconductor, which generates electron-hole-pairs or charges in response to radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that the configuration of the imager <b>50</b> should not be limited to the examples discussed previously, and that imagers having other configurations may be used in other embodiments. By way of example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/439,350, entitled &#x201c;MULTI ENERGY X-RAY IMAGER&#x201d; filed on May 15, 2003, discloses imaging devices capable of generating signals in response to multiple radiation energy levels, and can be used as the imager <b>50</b> in accordance with some embodiments. In addition, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/013,199, entitled &#x201c;X-RAY IMAGE ACQUISITION APPARATUS,&#x201d; and filed on Nov. 2, 2001, discloses an image detecting device that is capable of detecting multiple energy level X-ray images, and can also be used as the imager <b>50</b> in accordance with other embodiments. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/687,552, entitled &#x201c;MULTI-ENERGY RADIATION DETECTOR,&#x201d; and filed on Oct. 15, 2003, discloses multi-energy radiation detectors that can be used as the imager <b>50</b> in different embodiments. In other embodiments, the imager <b>50</b> can be implemented using flat panel technologies. Also, in further embodiments, the imager <b>50</b> can be a multi-slice flat panel. Multi-slice flat panel CT has been described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/687,552, entitled &#x201c;MULTI-SLICE FLAT PANEL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY,&#x201d; and filed on Oct. 15, 2003. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/439,350, 10/013,199, and 10/687,550 are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments, the imager <b>50</b> may be similarly incorporated in the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, or in any of the radiation systems <b>10</b> described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be noted that the radiation system <b>10</b> should not be limited to the configuration discussed previously, and that the radiation system <b>10</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> can have the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In the illustrated embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> includes the structure <b>12</b><i>a</i>, which has a configuration that is similar to that discussed previously with reference to structure <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The radiation system <b>10</b> also includes the arm <b>30</b> and the radiation source <b>40</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiments, the arm <b>30</b> has a configuration that resembles a L-shape, and includes a first portion <b>54</b> and a second portion <b>55</b>. The second portion <b>55</b> of the arm <b>30</b> has a first opening <b>19</b>, a second opening <b>21</b>, and a bore <b>56</b> extending between the first and the second openings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, which is a top view of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the arm <b>30</b> is rotatably coupled to the structure <b>12</b> via a cylindrical shaft <b>49</b>, which circumscribe at least part of the bore <b>22</b> and at least part of the bore <b>56</b> in a coaxial configuration. In other embodiments, the arm <b>30</b> can be rotatably coupled to the structure <b>12</b> in other configurations. The bore <b>56</b> is positioned relative to the bore <b>22</b> such that at least a part of a patient can move through the bore <b>56</b> to the bore <b>22</b>, and vice versa. In other embodiments, any of the features described herein can also be included with the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. For example, in other embodiments, the radiation source <b>40</b> can deliver diagnostic energy, and the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> can further include an imager (e.g., the imager <b>50</b>) in operative position with the radiation source <b>40</b> such that the radiation source <b>40</b> and the imager can be used to generate image data.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, any of the radiation systems <b>10</b> described herein can further include a x-ray source, such as tube <b>51</b> (an example of an imaging device) and an imager <b>52</b> (another example of an imaging device) secured to the second portion <b>54</b> of the arm <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), wherein the x-ray tube <b>51</b> and the imager <b>52</b> are positioned to image at least a portion of the patient. The x-ray tube <b>51</b> and the imager <b>52</b> can be used to generate data regarding a patient while the patient is positioned in an operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the x-ray tube <b>51</b> generates a cone beam, and the imager <b>52</b> generates cone beam CT data, which represent image of a portion of a patient. Alternatively, the imaging devices can be used for radiography or fluoroscopic imaging.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> when used with a computed tomography image acquisition device (CT device) <b>100</b>. The CT device <b>100</b> includes a gantry <b>102</b> having a bore <b>103</b>, a patient support <b>114</b> for supporting a patient <b>116</b>, and a control system <b>108</b> for controlling an operation of the gantry <b>102</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the gantry <b>102</b> has a slip-ring configuration (donut shape). Alternatively, the gantry <b>102</b> can have other configurations, such as a C-arm configuration. The CT device <b>100</b> also includes a radiation source (e.g., x-ray source) <b>120</b> that projects a beam <b>122</b> of radiation towards a detector <b>124</b> on an opposite side of the gantry <b>102</b> while the patient <b>116</b> is positioned at least partially between the radiation source <b>120</b> and the detector <b>124</b>. The radiation source <b>120</b> can be configured to generate a cone beam (for cone beam computed tomography&#x2014;&#x201c;CBCT&#x201d;). In other embodiments, the radiation source <b>120</b> generates beams having other configurations, such as a fan beam. The detector <b>124</b> has a plurality of sensor elements configured for sensing radiation that passes through the patient. Each sensor element generates an electrical signal representative of an intensity of the radiation as it passes through the patient. It will be appreciated that throughout the present specification, although specific embodiments of various imaging devices may be illustrated by fan beam CT or cone beam CT, any type of CT generally can be practiced in any of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The control system <b>108</b> includes a processor <b>134</b>, such as a computer processor, coupled to a gantry rotation control <b>141</b>. The control system <b>108</b> may also include a monitor <b>156</b> for displaying data and an input device <b>158</b>, such as a keyboard or a mouse, for inputting data. During a scan to acquire x-ray projection data (i.e., CT image data), the gantry <b>102</b> rotates about the patient. The rotation of the gantry <b>102</b> and the operation of the radiation source <b>120</b> are controlled by the gantry rotation control <b>141</b>, which provides power and timing signals to the radiation source <b>120</b> and controls a rotational speed and position of the gantry <b>102</b> based on signals received from the processor <b>134</b>. Although the control <b>141</b> is shown as a separate component from the gantry <b>102</b> and the processor <b>134</b>, in alternative embodiments, the control <b>141</b> can be a part of the gantry <b>102</b> or the processor <b>134</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>134</b> and the processor <b>84</b> are implemented using a same component, such as a single processor.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">During a radiation procedure using the CT device <b>100</b>, the radiation source <b>120</b> generates and directs a x-ray beam <b>122</b> towards the patient <b>116</b>, while the detector <b>124</b> measures the x-ray absorption at a plurality of transmission paths defined by the x-ray beam during the process. The detector <b>124</b> produces a voltage proportional to the intensity of incident x-rays, and the voltage is read and digitized for subsequent processing in a computer. After image data at different gantry angles have been collected, the collected data are processed for reconstruction of a matrix (CT image), which constitutes a depiction of a density function of the bodily section being examined. By considering one or more of such sections, a skilled diagnostician can often diagnose various bodily ailments. In some cases, the one or more sections can also be used to perform treatment planning.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in the figure, an axis <b>160</b> of the bore <b>103</b> of the CT device <b>100</b> is substantially parallel with (e.g., within 20&#xb0; from) the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>. Such configuration allows the patient <b>116</b> to be transported between a first operative position (e.g., the position of the patient <b>116</b> when being operated (e.g., treated or imaged) by the radiation source <b>40</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>) and a second operative position (e.g., the position of the patient <b>116</b> when being operated by the radiation source <b>120</b> of the CT device <b>100</b>). In the illustrated embodiments, the patient <b>116</b> can be transported between the first and second operative positions by positioning the patient support <b>114</b> in a linear manner along the axis <b>46</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>. Patient supports that can be used with the radiation system <b>10</b> will be described in further detail later. In the illustrated embodiments, the axis <b>160</b> of the bore <b>103</b> aligns with the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b>.

For example, in some embodiments in which the device <b>166</b> is being docked, the structure <b>12</b> includes a signal receiver and/or a transmitter, and the device <b>166</b> includes a signal transmitter and/or a receiver. During use, the signal transmitter of, e.g., the device <b>166</b> transmits signals to the structure <b>12</b> regarding a position of the device <b>166</b> (e.g., relative to a prescribed coordinate system).

In some embodiments, the support surface <b>206</b> of the patient support <b>201</b> can include a plurality of envelopes that can be filled with a fluid (gas or liquid). The envelopes can be selectively filled to create a desired topography of the support surface <b>206</b>, thereby allowing a patient to be correctly placed on the support surface <b>206</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the envelopes adjacent the perimeter of the support surface <b>206</b> can be selectively filled to create a recess in a center portion of the support surface <b>206</b>. Alternatively, small individual regions can have mechanically or thermally positionable mechanisms to provide various shapes in the support surface. The shape of the support surface <b>206</b> can accommodate a shape of a patient or a portion thereof. The precise shape for a given patient determined, e.g., during treatment planning or a previous session, can be stored and used later such that when the patient lies on the support surface <b>206</b>, the patient will be correctly positioned relative to the support surface <b>206</b>. In other embodiments, the support surface <b>206</b> does not include the envelopes or other positionable mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The patient support system <b>200</b> also includes a positioner <b>208</b> (represented as a block diagram) for positioning the patient support <b>201</b>. In particular, the positioner <b>208</b> is configured to position the patient support <b>201</b> at a first operative position such that radiation beam from the radiation source <b>40</b> can be delivered to a portion <b>117</b> (e.g., a target region) of the patient <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), and a second operative position such that the device <b>166</b> can be used to operate on the portion <b>117</b> of the patient <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the portion <b>117</b> of the patient <b>116</b> is positioned on (adjacent to) the first side <b>14</b> of the structure <b>12</b> when it is being treated by the radiation source <b>40</b>, and is positioned on (adjacent to) the second side <b>16</b> of the structure <b>12</b> (e.g., within a gantry of the device <b>166</b>) when it is being imaged by the device <b>166</b>. In the illustrated embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, the patient support system <b>200</b> is located on the first side <b>14</b> of the structure <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the patient support system <b>200</b> (or any of the patient support systems described herein) can be located on the second side <b>16</b> of the structure <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). In such cases, the positioner <b>208</b> places the patient support <b>201</b> at the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b> by translating at least a part of the patient support <b>201</b> past the device <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, the device <b>166</b> is an imaging device, such as a CT device. In such cases, the positioner <b>208</b> can be used to position the patient support <b>201</b> (and therefore, the patient <b>116</b>) at the second operative position associated with the imaging device <b>166</b>, thereby allowing the imaging device <b>166</b> to obtain image data of an internal bodily structure of the patient <b>116</b>. The obtained image data can then be used to create, or modify, a treatment plan, or to perform patient positioning. In some embodiments, the treatment plan includes parameters (such as a size and shape of a target region, an amount of radiation to be delivered to the target region, margin requirements, etc.) that can be used in a radiation treatment session to treat a portion of the patient <b>116</b>. Methods of creating treatment plans using image data are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the obtained image data can be used to verify a position, orientation, and/or a shape, of a target region (e.g., a tissue intended to be treated with radiation). For example, the obtained image data using the imaging device <b>166</b> can be compared against a previously obtained image data associated with the treatment plan to determine whether a target region has changed location, size, or shape. After a position, orientation, and/or a shape of the target region has been verified, the positioner <b>208</b> can position the patient <b>116</b> to the first operative position, at which the radiation source <b>40</b> can be used to deliver radiation beam <b>42</b> to treat the patient <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> does not move the patient <b>116</b> while radiation is being delivered to the patient <b>116</b> from the radiation source <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> can be used to move the patient <b>116</b> while radiation is being delivered from the radiation source.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, after the patient <b>116</b> has been treated, the positioner <b>208</b> can be used to position the patient <b>116</b> from a first operative position to a second operative position. While the patient <b>116</b> is at the second operative position, the imaging device <b>166</b> is used to obtain image data of the treated area of the patient <b>116</b>. The obtained image data can then be used to determine an effect (e.g., an effectiveness, accuracy, etc.) of the previously performed treatment procedure. In some embodiments, the obtained image data can be used to determine a next treatment plan (for a next treatment session) based on a treatment result from an earlier treatment session. For example, the obtained image data may be used to create the next treatment plan, or to modify a previously determined treatment plan, for a next treatment (e.g., next radiation segment, or next radiation session).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It should be noted from the above embodiments that the patient support system <b>200</b> is advantageous in that it allows the patient <b>116</b> to be treated and imaged without moving the patient <b>116</b> from one patient support (e.g., a patient support associated with a treatment device) to another patient support (e.g., a patient support associated with a diagnostic device). This in turn limits, or reduces the risk of, misalignment of the patient <b>116</b>, and/or misalignment of a target region within the patient <b>116</b>, relative to a treatment/diagnostic machine. The patient support system <b>200</b> is also advantageous because it saves setup time.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also, in some embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> may have imaging capability. For example, an imager may be placed opposite the source <b>40</b>. Moreover, one or more diagnostic x-ray sources and imager(s) opposite the source(s) may be provided. In some embodiments, one or more of the diagnostic sources and one or more imagers may be disposed in the same plane as the treatment source <b>40</b>. Such image data can be obtained for at least a portion (e.g., a target region) of the patient <b>116</b> while the patient <b>116</b> is at the first operative position. For example, before or after a treatment session, or in between treatment radiation delivery sessions, the radiation system <b>10</b> can deliver radiation energy to image a target region of the patient <b>116</b>. The obtained image data can be used to verify a position, an orientation, and/or a shape, of the target region, and/or to evaluate an effect of a treatment session. In any embodiment, image data obtained using the imaging capability of system <b>10</b> can be processed with image data obtained using one or more of the device <b>166</b>, and/or one or more images from a previous diagnostic or planning session, for treatment evaluation, treatment planning, and/or patient positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in accordance with some embodiments. The patient support system <b>200</b> can be used with any of the embodiments of the radiation system <b>10</b> described herein, or with any radiation system, such as a treatment device or a diagnostic device. In some embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> includes an actuator <b>240</b>, a cylinder <b>242</b> coupled to the actuator <b>240</b>, and a set of supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, wherein the patient support <b>201</b> is slidably coupled to the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>. In other embodiments, the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> are part of the patient support <b>201</b>, in which cases, the positioner <b>208</b> does not include the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>. During use, the actuator <b>240</b> delivers hydraulic pressure to activate the cylinder <b>242</b>, which in turn, causes the patient support <b>201</b> to translate in a first direction indicated by arrow <b>248</b>. The actuator <b>240</b> can also remove hydraulic pressure to activate the cylinder <b>242</b>, which in turn, causes the patient support <b>201</b> to translate in a second direction indicated by arrow <b>250</b>. The supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> provides vertical support for the patient support <b>201</b> as the patient support <b>201</b> is being positioned by the actuator <b>240</b>. In some embodiments, the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> are rails, and the patient support <b>201</b> includes a set of protrusions (e.g., wheels) that mate with the respective rails. Such configuration allows the patient support <b>201</b> to be guided in a desired manner as the patient support <b>201</b> is being positioned by the actuator <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">It should be noted that the patient support system <b>200</b> should not be limited to the example discussed previously, and that the patient support system <b>200</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, instead of the hydraulic pressure actuating cylinder <b>242</b>, the positioner <b>208</b> can include a motor, such as an electric motor, a pneumatic motor, or a piezoelectric motor, for positioning the patient support <b>201</b>. In some embodiments, the motor couples to a screw shaft and causes the screw shaft to turn. The screw shaft is coupled to the patient support <b>201</b>, which positions the patient support <b>201</b> by rotation of the screw shaft. Also, in other embodiments, the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> can have configurations that are different from that shown in the figure. For example, instead of the bottom side of the patient support <b>201</b>, the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> can be coupled to the top side of the patient support <b>201</b> or to side edges of the patient support <b>201</b>. In other embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> can be implemented using machineries, devices, and systems that are known in the art of positioning devices.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> is configured to translate linearly substantially along the axis <b>46</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> can also have other degrees of freedom. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates the patient support system <b>200</b> having multiple degrees of freedom in accordance with some embodiments. The patient support system <b>200</b> can be used with any of the embodiments of the radiation system <b>10</b> described herein, or with any radiation system, such as a treatment device or a diagnostic device. In the illustrated embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> includes a first base portion <b>300</b>, a second base portion <b>302</b> that is rotatably coupled to the first base portion <b>300</b>, a first actuator <b>304</b> for turning a shaft <b>306</b>, a second actuator <b>308</b> for rotating a third actuator <b>310</b>, the third actuator <b>310</b>, a cylinder <b>312</b> coupled to the third actuator <b>310</b>, and a set of supports <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. The first actuator <b>304</b> can be, for example, a motor, that rotates the shaft <b>306</b>, thereby causing the patient support <b>201</b> to roll or rotate about a first axis <b>324</b>. The second actuator <b>308</b> can be, for example, a motor, that causes rotation of the third actuator <b>310</b> about a second axis <b>326</b>, thereby creating an inclined angle or pitch for the patient support <b>201</b>. The third actuator <b>310</b> is configured to actuate the cylinder <b>312</b>, thereby causing the patient support <b>201</b> to translate in directions <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, as similarly discussed previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In some embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> can further include a fourth actuator (not shown) for causing the second base portion <b>302</b> to rotate relative to the first base portion <b>300</b> about a third axis <b>328</b>. Also, in other embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> can further include an actuator for translating the patient support <b>201</b> in the directions <b>329</b><i>a</i>, <b>329</b><i>b</i>. In further embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> can further include an actuator for changing an elevation of the patient support <b>201</b> (e.g., moving the patient support <b>201</b> in either of the directions <b>341</b>, <b>342</b>). In some embodiments, such feature may be desirable if the bore <b>22</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b> is offset (e.g., higher or lower) than the bore of the adjacent device (e.g., bore <b>160</b> of the device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In such cases, after the patient has been treated at the first operative position associated with the structure <b>12</b>, the patient will be moved to the second operative position associated with the adjacent device by translating the patient support longitudinally and raising (or lowering) the patient support. This will ensure that the patient support is located at a desired elevation relative to the second bore. The various actuators described herein can be implemented using machineries, devices, and systems that are known in the art of positioning devices. The axes described herein can be positioned in different locations than those shown herein as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Providing multiple degrees of freedom for the patient support <b>201</b> is advantageous in that it allows the patient <b>116</b> to be treated or imaged in different configurations, and allows matching of patient position and/or orientation from session to session (e.g., from a first imaging session to a second imaging session, from a first treatment session to a second treatment session, and/or from a treatment session to an imaging session, or vice versa). For example, in some embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> can be rotated about the axis <b>324</b> to place the patient <b>116</b> in a desired orientation before the radiation source <b>40</b> is used to deliver radiation to the patient <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> can be rotated about the axis <b>324</b> while the radiation source <b>40</b> is delivering radiation to the patient <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the rotation of the patient support <b>201</b> about the axis <b>324</b> can be used to compensate for slippage of the radiation source <b>40</b> relative to the structure <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> can be rotated about the axis <b>324</b> in accordance with a treatment plan to thereby allow a target region of the patient <b>116</b> to be treated from different angles. Providing for pitch (e.g. rotation about axis <b>326</b>) and/or yaw (e.g. rotation about axis <b>328</b>) type motions allow for providing non coplanar fields. In further embodiments, the positioning (in any or a combination of the degrees of freedom described herein) provided by any of the embodiments of the patient positioning system <b>200</b> may be used to execute and/or update a treatment plan. For example, instead of or in addition to modifying a gantry angle, a position of the patient in one or more axes may be modified based on images of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in the figure, the patient support system <b>200</b> has a cantilever configuration. To eliminate, or at least reduce, the effect of tipping due to the cantilever configuration, the patient support system <b>200</b> further includes a weight <b>322</b> secured to the second base portion <b>302</b>. In other embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> does not include the weight <b>322</b>. For example, if the first actuator <b>304</b> is made sufficiently heavy to prevent tipping of the patient support <b>201</b>, then the weight <b>322</b> is not needed. Also, in other embodiments, instead of the cantilever configuration shown, the patient support system <b>200</b> can have other configurations, such as a simply-supported configuration, which includes an additional support (not shown) for supporting the first end <b>202</b> of the patient support <b>201</b>. In further embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> is secured to a floor, a platform, or a structure, such as a rotatable platform. Rotatable platform will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the illustrated embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> further includes a docking device <b>317</b> which allows the patient support system <b>200</b> to be docked into a desired position. In some embodiments, the docking device <b>317</b> includes a first set of rollers <b>318</b> on a first side of the first base portion <b>300</b>, and a second set of rollers <b>320</b> on a second side of the first base portion <b>300</b>. In other embodiments, the docking device <b>317</b> can have less than two (e.g., one) set of rollers, or more than two sets of rollers. Also, in other embodiments, the docking device <b>317</b> can have less than two rollers <b>318</b>/<b>322</b> or more than two rollers <b>318</b>/<b>322</b> per set. Alternatively, any technique or device for moving the patient support <b>200</b>, including any of those described in conjunction with moving device <b>166</b> described earlier, may be used.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, three sets <b>330</b><i>a</i>-<b>330</b><i>c </i>of rails are provided adjacent to the radiation system <b>10</b>. The first rail set <b>330</b><i>a </i>includes first and second rails <b>332</b><i>a</i>, <b>332</b><i>b</i>, the second rail set <b>330</b><i>b </i>includes first and second rails <b>332</b><i>c</i>, <b>332</b><i>d</i>, and the third rail set <b>330</b><i>c </i>includes first and second rails <b>332</b><i>e</i>, <b>332</b><i>f</i>. The rails <b>332</b><i>a</i>, <b>332</b><i>b </i>of the first set <b>330</b><i>a </i>are configured (e.g., sized and shaped) to mate with the sets <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> of rollers, respectively. The rails <b>332</b><i>c</i>, <b>332</b><i>d </i>of the second set <b>330</b><i>b </i>are configured (e.g., sized and shaped) to mate with the sets <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> of rollers, respectively.

In other embodiments, instead of having three sets <b>330</b><i>a</i>-<b>330</b><i>c </i>of rails <b>332</b>. Less than three sets (e.g., one set), or more than three sets of rails can be provided. Also, in other embodiments, instead of having two rails <b>332</b> per set <b>330</b>, each set <b>330</b> can have less than two rails <b>332</b> or more than two rails <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the position of one or both of the sets <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> of rollers of the patient support system <b>200</b> can be adjusted such that the patient support system <b>200</b> can be mated with rails having different configurations. For example, in some embodiments, the distance between the sets <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> of rollers can be varied such that the patient support system <b>200</b> can be docked with rails having different spacing. Also, in other embodiments, one or more rollers can be removed or added to the patient support system <b>200</b> for allowing the patient support system <b>200</b> to dock with a rail system having different number of rails. In some embodiments, the docking system <b>317</b> of the patient support system <b>200</b> can further include the rails <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In other embodiments, the position of one or both of the rails <b>332</b> in each rail set <b>330</b> can be adjusted such that the rail system can accommodate different patient support systems having different configurations.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It should be noted that the docking device <b>317</b> of the patient support system <b>200</b> should not be limited to the examples discussed previously, and that the docking device <b>317</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the docking device <b>317</b> can have a first portion associated with the patient support system <b>200</b>, and a second portion associated with the radiation system <b>10</b>, wherein the first portion and/or the second portion are configured to mate with each other. The first and second portions of the docking device <b>317</b> can be implemented using any machinery, device, or system known in the art.

In further embodiments, any of the features or components described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> may be used to implement the docking device <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one method of use, the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> can be docked into a desired position relative to the radiation system <b>10</b> using the first set <b>330</b><i>a </i>of rails <b>332</b><i>a</i>, <b>332</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, a longitudinal axis <b>340</b> of the patient support <b>201</b> is substantially parallel (e.g., within a prescribed range of angles, such as between 0&#xb0; to 20&#xb0;) with the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>. In such configuration, at least part of the patient support <b>201</b> can be positioned through the bore <b>22</b>. In another method of use, the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> can be docked into a desired position relative to the radiation system <b>10</b> using the second set <b>330</b><i>b </i>of rails <b>332</b><i>c</i>, <b>332</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>). When docked using the second set <b>330</b><i>b </i>of rails <b>332</b><i>c</i>, <b>332</b><i>d</i>, the longitudinal axis <b>340</b> of the patient support <b>201</b> is substantially non-parallel (e.g., forming an angle that is larger than a prescribed value, such as, 5&#xb0;) with the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>. Such configuration allows the patient <b>116</b> supported on the patient support <b>201</b> to be treated in a non-coplanar manner. In yet another method of use, the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> can be docked into a desired position relative to the radiation system <b>10</b> using the third set <b>330</b><i>c </i>of rails <b>332</b><i>e</i>, <b>332</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). Such configuration allows the patient <b>116</b> supported on the patient support <b>201</b> to be treated in another non-coplanar manner. In yet another method of use, the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> can be docked next to the radiation system <b>10</b> in a side-by-side manner using a fourth set <b>330</b><i>d </i>of rails (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>). Such configuration allows the patient <b>116</b> supported on the patient support <b>201</b> to be treated in another non-coplanar manner.

<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> illustrate a patient support system <b>400</b> in accordance with other embodiments. The support system <b>400</b> includes a first positioner <b>402</b>, a second positioner <b>404</b>, and a patient support <b>406</b>. The first positioner <b>402</b> is located adjacent to the radiation system <b>10</b>, and the second positioner <b>404</b> is located adjacent to the device <b>166</b>. The patient support <b>406</b> has a first end <b>407</b> and a second end <b>409</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The first positioner <b>402</b> includes an actuator <b>408</b>, a coupler <b>410</b> that is used to detachably secure the patient support <b>406</b> to the positioner <b>402</b>, and a support system <b>412</b> coupled to the patient support <b>406</b> and the actuator <b>408</b>. The actuator <b>408</b> can be a motor, a hydraulic mechanism, or other mechanism, and is configured to position the patient support <b>406</b> along the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b>. As the patient support <b>406</b> is being positioned by the actuator <b>408</b>, the support system <b>412</b> provides structural support for the patient support <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, the support system <b>412</b> includes a pair of supports, such as the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> discussed previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Alternatively, the support system <b>412</b> can have other configurations (e.g., having a platform). In the illustrated embodiments, the coupler <b>410</b> includes a jaw assembly <b>414</b> having a first jaw <b>416</b> and a second jaw <b>418</b>, and is configured to engage with the first end <b>407</b> of the patient support <b>406</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the jaw assembly <b>414</b> is in a closed position, thereby detachably coupling the patient support <b>406</b> to the first positioner <b>402</b>. In other embodiments, instead of the jaw assembly <b>414</b>, the coupler <b>410</b> can have other configurations that allow the coupler <b>410</b> to detachably secure to a portion of the patient support <b>406</b>. For example, in other embodiments, the coupler <b>410</b> can include one or more dowels or protrusions that are sized to be inserted in respective slot(s) at the patient support <b>406</b>. The dowel(s) or protrusion(s) may be used to provide moment resistance resulted from the patient <b>116</b> being supported on the patient support <b>406</b>. The coupler <b>410</b> may further include a locking mechanism for securing to the patient support <b>406</b> after the dowel(s) or protrusion(s) have been inserted into respective slot(s). In further embodiments, the coupler <b>410</b> may have other types of securing mechanisms for detachably coupling to the patient support <b>406</b>. Also, in alternative embodiments, instead of the first end <b>407</b>, the coupler <b>410</b> can engage with other portion(s) of the patient support <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, the second positioner <b>404</b> may be similar to the first positioner <b>402</b>, and includes an actuator <b>420</b>, a coupler <b>424</b> that is used to detachably secure the patient support <b>406</b> to the second positioner <b>404</b>, and a support system <b>426</b> coupled to the patient support <b>406</b> and the actuator <b>420</b>. The actuator <b>420</b> can be a motor, a hydraulic mechanism, or other mechanism, and is configured to position the patient support <b>406</b> along the axis <b>160</b> of the lumen <b>122</b>. As the patient support <b>406</b> is being positioned by the actuator <b>420</b>, the support system <b>426</b> provides structural support for the patient support <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, the support system <b>426</b> includes a pair of supports, such as the supports <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> discussed previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Alternatively, the support system <b>426</b> can have other configurations. The coupler <b>424</b> includes a jaw assembly <b>428</b> having a first jaw <b>430</b> and a second jaw <b>432</b>, and is configured to engage with the second end <b>409</b> of the patient support <b>406</b>. In other embodiments, instead of the jaw assembly <b>428</b>, the coupler <b>424</b> can have other configurations that allow the coupler <b>424</b> to detachably secure to a portion of the patient support <b>406</b>. Also, in alternative embodiments, instead of the second end <b>409</b>, the coupler <b>424</b> can engage with other portion(s) of the patient support <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In other embodiments, the second positioner <b>404</b> can have a configuration that is different from the first positioner <b>402</b>. For example, in other embodiments, the second positioner <b>404</b> can have number of degrees of freedom, and/or degrees of freedom, that are different from those of the first positioner <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The patient support system <b>400</b> can be used to position the patient <b>116</b> at a first operative position (e.g., the position of the patient <b>116</b>/patient support <b>406</b> at which the patient <b>116</b> can be treated by the radiation source <b>40</b>), and at a second operative position (e.g., the position of the patient <b>116</b>/patient support <b>406</b> at which the patient <b>116</b> can be operated by the device <b>166</b>). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the coupler <b>410</b> can engage with the patient support <b>406</b> to thereby allow the actuator <b>408</b> to control a position of the patient support <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, the actuator <b>408</b> is coupled to a processor (such as any of the processors described herein), which controls an operation of the actuator <b>408</b>. For example, the processor <b>84</b>/<b>134</b> can provide signals to the actuator <b>408</b> to cause the actuator <b>408</b> to position the patient support <b>406</b> along the axis <b>46</b> during, or in between, radiation delivery sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If it is desired to place the patient <b>116</b> at the second operative position, the actuator <b>408</b> then advances the patient support <b>406</b> further into the bore <b>22</b> until the second end <b>409</b> of the patient support <b>406</b> is engaged with the coupler <b>424</b> of the second positioner <b>404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). When the coupler <b>424</b> is engaged with the second end <b>409</b>, the jaws <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> of the jaw assembly <b>428</b> are closed to grab onto the second end <b>409</b> of the patient support <b>406</b>. After the coupler <b>424</b> is engaged with the patient support <b>406</b>, the coupler <b>410</b> of the first positioner <b>402</b> is then disengaged (e.g., by opening the jaw assembly <b>414</b>) with the first side <b>407</b> of the patient support <b>406</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>). The patient support <b>406</b> can then be positioned by the second positioner <b>404</b> until the patient support <b>406</b> is at the second operative position. During use of the device <b>166</b>, the second positioner <b>404</b> can be used to position the patient support <b>406</b> along the axis <b>160</b> associated with the device <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In other embodiments, the patient support system <b>400</b> can have configurations that are different from those described previously. For example, in other embodiments, the patient support system <b>400</b> can include other types of mechanical devices or systems that allow the patient support <b>406</b> to be passed from one positioner to another positioner. Also, in other embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> and/or the device <b>166</b> can have a mechanical component that temporarily engages the patient support <b>406</b> before the patient support is passed from a first positioner to a second positioner. In such cases, the first positioner may or may not engage with the patient support <b>406</b> while the radiation system <b>10</b> and/or the device <b>166</b> is engaged with the patient support <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, a single positioner can be used such that after the system <b>10</b> and/or system <b>166</b> has engaged the patient support <b>406</b>, the positioner is moved to the opposite side to engage the patient support <b>406</b> from that side.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In further embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> or the device <b>166</b> can include a positioner for positioning the patient support <b>406</b>. In such cases, the patient support system <b>400</b> does not include the positioner <b>404</b> (or the positioner <b>402</b>), and the positioner <b>402</b> (or the positioner <b>404</b>) can be used to position the patient support <b>406</b> through a first range of positions, and pass the patient support <b>406</b> to the positioner of the radiation system <b>10</b> or the device <b>166</b>, which can be used to position the patient support <b>406</b> through a second range of positions. The first range of positions and the second range of positions may or may not overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In any of the embodiments of the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b> described herein, the positioner <b>208</b> (or positioner <b>402</b> or <b>404</b>) can be coupled to a computer system or a processor, such as the processor <b>84</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the processor <b>134</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or a separate processor. The processor can then be used to control an operation of the positioner <b>208</b>. For example, the processor may be configured (e.g., programmed and/or constructed) to control an amount of movement of the patient support (e.g., rotation about axis <b>324</b> to thereby tilt the patient support, and/or other types of movement described herein) during a procedure. In some embodiments, the amount of movement of the patient support is prescribed by a treatment plan, which is executed by the processor during a treatment session. The treatment plan may be one that is determined during a diagnostic session, or alternatively, be one that is determined during a treatment session (for example, the treatment plan determined in a diagnostic session may be modified during a treatment session to result in a modified treatment plan).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> can further include one or more position/motion sensors for sensing a position/motion of the patient support <b>201</b>. The sensed position/motion is then transmitted from the sensor(s) to the processor, which determines an actual position of the patient support <b>201</b> based on the sensed position/motion received from the sensor(s). In some cases, the processor can be further configured to position the patient support <b>201</b> based on the actual position of the patient support <b>201</b> (e.g., having a feedback feature).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Also, in any of the embodiments of the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b> described herein, the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b> can further include one or more markings (not shown), which allows the patient support <b>201</b>/<b>406</b> to be registered with the radiation system <b>10</b> and/or with the device <b>166</b>. For example, one or both of the radiation system <b>10</b> and the device <b>166</b> can include an optical sensor for sensing the marking(s) of the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b>, thereby allowing a position of the patient support <b>201</b> to be determined. The optical sensor can be, for example, a camera or an infrared position sensor. In some embodiments, the optical sensor is coupled to the processor, which receives position signals from the optical sensor. Based on the received position signals, the processor then determines an actual position of the patient support <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be noted that the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> can have the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. The patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> includes the patient support <b>201</b>, a patient positioner <b>208</b>, a first base portion <b>300</b>, and a second base portion <b>302</b> that is rotatably coupled to the first base portion <b>300</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the first base portion <b>300</b> is coupled (e.g., fixedly secured, or detachably secured) to a platform <b>262</b>, which is rotatably secured to a floor (or a platform). The platform <b>262</b> can rotate about a vertical axis <b>350</b> in the directions shown by the double-headed arrow <b>360</b><i>a</i>. The second base portion <b>302</b> is rotatably coupled to the first base portion <b>301</b> such that the second base portion <b>302</b> is rotatable about vertical axis <b>352</b> in the directions shown by the arrow <b>360</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, first base portion <b>300</b> and the platform <b>262</b> can be implemented as a single unit or structure.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The positioner <b>208</b> includes a first arm <b>366</b> rotatably secured to the second base portion <b>302</b> such that the first arm <b>366</b> is rotatable relative to the second base portion <b>302</b> in the directions shown by the arrow <b>360</b><i>c</i>. The positioner <b>208</b> also includes a second arm <b>368</b> that is rotatably secured to the first arm <b>366</b> such that the second arm <b>368</b> is rotatable relative to the first arm <b>366</b> in the directions shown by the arrow <b>360</b><i>d</i>. The patient support <b>201</b> is slidably secured to a support <b>370</b>, which in turn, is rotatably secured to the second arm <b>368</b>. As such, the patient support <b>201</b> is rotatable relative to the second arm <b>368</b> in the directions shown by the arrow <b>360</b><i>e</i>, and is slidable relative to the support <b>370</b> as indicated by the arrow <b>360</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">During use, the platform <b>262</b> can be rotated to place the patient support <b>201</b> at a desired position relative to the radiation system <b>10</b>. Also, in some cases, the second base portion <b>302</b> can be rotated relative to the first base portion <b>300</b> to place the patient support <b>201</b> at a desired position relative to the radiation system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). As illustrated, the combination of rotating the first base portion <b>300</b> about the axis <b>350</b>, and rotating the second base portion <b>302</b> about the axis <b>352</b> (and in some cases, further coupled with translation movement <b>360</b><i>f </i>of the patient support <b>201</b>) allows the patient support <b>201</b> to be oriented at a desired angle <b>390</b> relative to the radiation system <b>10</b>, and be placed in an operative position associated with the radiation system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>). For example, in some cases, after the patient support <b>201</b> has been positioned such that a point <b>380</b> on the patient support <b>201</b> is located at a desired location, the movements of the base portions <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> (and in some cases, together with translation of the patient support <b>201</b>) may allow the patient support <b>201</b> to be rotated about a vertical axis <b>384</b> through the point <b>380</b> (as indicated by the arrow <b>382</b>) to thereby adjust an orientation of the patient support <b>201</b> relative to the system <b>10</b>. Also, in some cases, movements of the arms <b>366</b>, <b>368</b> allows a height (elevation) of the patient support <b>201</b> to be adjusted. Further, the patient support <b>201</b> may rotate relative to the second arm <b>368</b> as the second arm <b>368</b> rotates relative to the first arm <b>366</b> to thereby remain in a horizontal configuration. The patient support <b>201</b> may rotate relative to the second arm <b>368</b> while the second arm <b>368</b> remains stationary relative to the first arm <b>366</b>. In such cases, the movement of the patient support <b>201</b> allows an angle of tilt of the patient support <b>201</b> to be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In other embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> of the patient support system <b>200</b> may be configured so that it does not translate relative to the arm <b>368</b>. Also, in further embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> may have other degrees of freedom, such as any or combination of the degrees of freedom described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. For example, in other embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b> may have a roll feature in which the patient support <b>201</b> may tilt or rotate about a longitudinal axis <b>324</b> of the patient support <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Although the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> is illustrated as being used with the radiation system <b>10</b> with the arm <b>30</b>, in other embodiments, the patient support system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> may be used with any of the radiation systems <b>10</b> described herein (e.g., the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> that does not include the arm <b>30</b>), with any of the devices <b>166</b> described herein, and/or with any radiation system not described herein (which may be a treatment machine or a diagnostic machine).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In any of the embodiments of the patient support system <b>200</b>/<b>400</b> described herein, the patient support <b>201</b>/<b>406</b> can have a feature that allows a surface of the patient support <b>201</b> to be customized for different patients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref> illustrates a variation of the patient support <b>201</b> in accordance with some embodiments. The patient support <b>201</b> includes a plurality of support portions <b>270</b><i>a</i>-<b>270</b><i>j </i>that are positionable relative to each other, thereby allowing a desired support surface to be formed. In the illustrated embodiments, support portions <b>270</b><i>a</i>-<b>270</b><i>j </i>are adapted to support a head, left arm, right arm, upper body, mid-body, lower body, left side of a body, right side of a body, thighs, and legs, respectively, of a patient. In some cases, the support portion <b>270</b><i>d </i>can be rotated relative to the support portion <b>270</b><i>f </i>(as indicated by arrow <b>274</b><i>d</i>) to form a convenient position and shape for loading and unloading a patient for treatment and/or imaging. For example, to facilitate patient loading, the patient support can form into a shape of a chair (e.g., by placing portion <b>270</b><i>d </i>in a substantially vertical position) onto which the patient sits. Thereafter, once the patient is in the chair (and positioned and/or immobilized if desired), the patient support forms into a position and/or moves into a location as needed for treatment and/or imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>, support portion <b>270</b><i>a </i>may translate relative to support portion <b>270</b><i>d </i>(as indicated by arrow <b>274</b><i>b</i>) to accommodate patients with different neck lengths, and may rotate relative to support portion <b>270</b><i>d </i>(as indicated by arrow <b>274</b><i>a</i>) to adjust an angle of tilt of a patient's head. The support portion <b>270</b><i>d </i>may also translate relative to support portion <b>270</b><i>e </i>(as indicated by arrow <b>274</b><i>c</i>) to adjust for patients with different body lengths. The support portions <b>270</b><i>g</i>, <b>270</b><i>h </i>may rotate (as indicated by arrows <b>274</b><i>e</i>) and translate (as indicated by arrows <b>274</b><i>f</i>) to hold a patient's body in place and to adjust for patients with different body widths. The support portion <b>270</b><i>i </i>may rotate relative to the support portion <b>270</b><i>f </i>to adjust an angle of tile of a patient's thighs. The support portion <b>270</b><i>j </i>may rotate relative to the support portion <b>270</b><i>i </i>to adjust an angle of tile of a patient's legs. The support portions <b>270</b><i>b</i>, <b>270</b><i>c </i>may rotate (as indicated by arrows <b>274</b><i>j</i>), may locally translate (as indicated by arrows <b>2741</b>), and/or may globally translate (as indicated by arrows <b>274</b><i>k</i>) to adjust for different arms positions of the patient. In other embodiments, not all of the support portions <b>270</b> of the patient support <b>201</b> are moveable as described, and any or a subset of the support portions <b>270</b> may be fixed relative to an adjacent support portion. Also, in further embodiments, any of the support portions <b>270</b> may have additional degree of movement(s). For example, in other embodiments, the support portion <b>270</b><i>i </i>may translate relative to the support portion <b>270</b><i>f </i>to adjust for patients with different thigh lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some embodiments, the patient support <b>201</b>/<b>406</b> can further include device(s) for knowing and setting position for each of the supported portions, such as position sensors secured to each of the support portions <b>270</b><i>a</i>-<b>270</b><i>j</i>. In such cases, a memory can be used to store position signals from the position sensors, which represent a desired support configuration of the patient support <b>201</b> for a specific user. The memory can store different sets of position signals for different users. Also, a user interface, such as a computer, or a set of buttons, can be used to allow a user to select a desired set of position signals from the memory. In some embodiments, the positioner <b>208</b> automatically adjusts the support portions <b>270</b><i>a</i>-<b>270</b><i>j </i>based on the selected set of position signals, thereby placing the support portions <b>270</b><i>a</i>-<b>270</b><i>j </i>in a configuration that was previously selected by a user.</p>

The marker block <b>442</b> includes a plurality of markers <b>444</b> that are so positioned such that at least some of them can be viewed/sensed by the optical device <b>441</b><i>a</i>. The markers <b>444</b> can be implemented using reflective objects. In the illustrated embodiments, the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the processor <b>134</b>, which controls an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b> based on input received from the optical device <b>441</b><i>a</i>.

The determined position and orientation of the marker block <b>442</b> can then be used to determine whether the patient <b>116</b> has moved and/or an amount of movement undergone by the patient <b>116</b>. In such cases, the processor <b>134</b> can be configured to control an operation (e.g., a rotational speed of the radiation source <b>40</b> about the patient <b>116</b>, an activation of the radiation source <b>40</b>, a de-activation of the radiation source <b>40</b>, an activation period of the radiation source <b>40</b> (duration of radiation delivery), etc.) of the radiation system <b>10</b> based on the determined patient movement. In some embodiments, the patient movement is associated with a respiration of the patient <b>116</b>. In such cases, the processor <b>134</b> can be configured to control an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b> based on phase(s) of the respiratory cycle of the patient <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the processor <b>134</b> can be configured to control an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b> based on other physiological movements of the patient <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, the processor <b>134</b> can be configured to gate an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b> based on the determined patient movement. For example, in some embodiments, the processor <b>134</b> is configured to activate the radiation source <b>40</b> when an amplitude of the patient movement is below a prescribed threshold, and de-activate the radiation source <b>40</b> when an amplitude of the patient movement is above a prescribed threshold. In another example, the processor <b>134</b> is configured to activate the radiation source <b>40</b> during a certain prescribed phase(s) of the patient movement (e.g., respiratory movement/cycle), and de-activate the radiation source <b>40</b> during another prescribed phase(s) of the patient movement. As used in this specification, the term &#x201c;phase&#x201d; refers to a variable that is associated with a degree of completeness of a physiological cycle (e.g., a respiratory cycle). Patient position sensing systems, methods of performing medical procedures based on sensed physiological movement, and methods of gating an operation of a radiation device have been described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/178,383, 09/893,122, 10/664,534, 10/454,754, 10/234,658, 10/305,416, 10/656,478, and 10/655,920, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">It should be noted that the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> should not be limited by the configuration described previously, and that the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, instead of a single optical device <b>441</b><i>a</i>, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> can further include one or more additional optical device(s) <b>441</b> for sensing the marker block <b>442</b> when the patient <b>116</b> is located at the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>. Also, in other embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> can further include one or more marker block(s) <b>442</b>. In further embodiments, instead of having a cube configuration, the marker block <b>442</b> can have other shapes, such as a semi-spherical shape, a cone shape, or other customized shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In other embodiments, instead of, or in addition to, having the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>for sensing patient movement when the patient <b>116</b> is being operated by the radiation source <b>40</b>, the radiation system <b>10</b> can have a second optical device <b>441</b><i>b </i>for sensing patient movement when the patient <b>116</b> is being operated by the device <b>166</b> (illustrated as a block diagram) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). In such cases, when the patient <b>116</b> is positioned at the second operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>, the optical device <b>441</b><i>b </i>can be used to sense patient movement. The sensed patient movement can then be used to control an operation of the device <b>166</b>, as similarly discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, if the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>is secured to the patient support system <b>200</b> (such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>), then the second optical device <b>441</b><i>b </i>is not needed. In such cases, the optical device <b>441</b><i>b </i>will be moved with the patient support <b>201</b>, and the optical device <b>441</b> can be used to sense the marker block <b>442</b> when the patient is positioned at the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>, and at the second operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>. In other embodiments, the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>may be secured at a distance that is sufficiently far away from the first and second operative positions such that it can view both positions in a single field of view. In further embodiments, the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>may be moveable (e.g., pivotable and/or translatable). For example, if the device <b>166</b> is positioned next to the structure <b>12</b> in a side-by-side configuration, the optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>may be rotated towards a first direction associated with the structure <b>12</b> when the patient is being operated in the first operative position, and may be rotated towards a second direction associated with the device <b>166</b> when the patient is being operated in the second operative position. Devices placed in a side-by-side configuration will be described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the device <b>166</b> is a CT device. In such cases, the second optical device <b>441</b><i>b </i>is used to determine phases of a physiological cycle as the CT device is used to generate a plurality of images at the plurality of phases of a physiological cycle, wherein each of the images provides an indication of a location of a target region. The processor <b>134</b> then creates a treatment plan based at least in part on the plurality of images collected at the plurality of phases in the cycle. After the treatment plan has been created, the patient <b>116</b> is then positioned from the second operative position associated with the device <b>166</b> to the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b> (e.g., by being translated at least partially through the bore <b>22</b> of the structure <b>12</b>). The radiation source <b>40</b> is then used to treat the patient <b>116</b> in accordance with the created treatment plan. In some embodiments, the created treatment plan prescribes the phases of a physiological cycle at which radiation is to be delivered to the patient <b>116</b>, and the amount of radiation to be delivered at the prescribed phases. In such cases, the first optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>can be used to determine patient movement when the patient <b>116</b> is at the first operative position, and the radiation source <b>40</b> is used to deliver radiation to the patient <b>116</b> based on the determined patient movement in conformance with the treatment plan.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In any of the embodiments described herein, instead of using the optical device <b>441</b> to sense marker(s) on the marker block <b>442</b>, the optical device <b>441</b> may be used to sense a marker on a patient. For example, the marker may be a print made on a skin of the patient. Alternatively, the marker may be a part of an anatomy of the patient, such as a skin mark on the patient, or a topography/shape of a portion of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Although the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> has been described as having the optical device <b>441</b> and the marker block <b>442</b>, in other embodiments, other position/movement sensing devices can be used as the patient position sensing system <b>440</b>. As such, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> may or may not include the optical device <b>441</b> and the marker block <b>442</b>. For example, in other embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> includes one or more infrared position sensors for sensing at least a part of the patient <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> includes one or more magnetic field sensors. In such cases, one or more magnetic devices, such as coils, may be placed within, or secured on, the patient <b>116</b>. An external electromagnetic coil then provides electromagnetic pulses to interact with the coil(s) within/on the patient <b>116</b>. Based on the interaction, the position and/or the orientation of the patient <b>116</b> can be determined. In alternative embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> includes one or more sensors, such as RF transponder, ultrasound sensors, or microwave energy sensors (which utilizes technologies that are similar to those used in radar systems), for sensing at least a part of the patient <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> includes one or more ultrasound energy sensors for sensing at least a part of the patient <b>116</b>. In further embodiments, other devices, such as a strain gauge, or other mechanical/electrical devices, can be used to sense a position/movement of the patient <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In further embodiments, the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> may be an imaging device. The imaging device may be, for example, a CT device, a laminar tomography device, a MRI device, a fluoroscope, an angiography device, a PET device, a PET-CT device, a SPECT device, or a tomosynthesis imaging device. In such cases, the imaging device may be used to obtain an image of a portion of the patient, and a processor then processes the image to determine a position of a target tissue. For example, the processor may process the image to identify one or more markers implanted at or near a target tissue. Alternatively, the processor may process the image to identify a part of an anatomy of the patient. In some embodiments, the device <b>166</b> may be the imaging device that is a part of the patient position sensing system <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">It should be noted that the method of using the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> should not be limited to the examples discussed previously, and that the patient position sensing system <b>440</b> can be used to assist determining treatment plans and/or to assist gating of medical procedures in other manners in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, the patient movement sensed by the first optical device <b>441</b><i>a </i>can be used in a predictive physiological gating procedure, in which the operation of the radiation source <b>40</b> is predictively gated based at least in part on the patient movement. Predictive gating of a medical procedure has been described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/893,122.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Further, in some embodiments, the position sensing system <b>440</b> can be used to determine a position of the patient support <b>201</b>. For example, the marker block <b>442</b> (or another marker block) can be secured to the patient support, and the optical device <b>441</b> is then used to sense the markers on the marker block. Based on the sensed markers, the processor <b>134</b> then determines a position and an orientation of the marker block <b>442</b> (and therefore, the position and orientation of the patient support <b>201</b>). In other embodiments, instead of using a marker block, the patient support <b>201</b> can include a detectable marker secured to a portion of the support <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the above embodiments, the position sensing system <b>440</b> has been described as having the marker block <b>442</b>. However, in other embodiments, the marker block <b>442</b> is not needed, and the position sensing system <b>440</b> does not include the marker block <b>442</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the optical device <b>441</b> can be used to sense a portion of a patient, wherein the portion is used as a marker (e.g., a physiological marker). In such cases, a processor (such as the processor <b>84</b>/<b>134</b>) can be configured to receive image signal from the optical device <b>441</b>, and process the signal to identify the physiological marker. In some embodiments, the processor can be configured to identify and analyze a topography of a patient surface, and determine a characteristic of the patient, such as an amplitude and/or a phase of a breathing cycle of the patient based on a result of the analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In any of the embodiments of the radiation system <b>10</b> described herein, the radiation system <b>10</b> can further include one or more compensating coils <b>450</b> that are electrically coupled to a generator <b>452</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). In the illustrated embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> includes a pair of coils <b>450</b><i>a</i>, <b>450</b><i>b </i>that are parallel to a x-axis of the radiation system <b>10</b>, a pair of coils <b>450</b><i>c</i>, <b>450</b><i>d </i>that are parallel to a y-axis of the radiation system <b>10</b>, and four coils <b>450</b><i>e</i>-<b>450</b><i>h </i>that are parallel to a z-axis of the radiation system <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the number of coils <b>450</b> can be different from that shown. For example, in other embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> can include one coil (e.g., coil <b>450</b><i>a</i>) that is parallel to the x-axis, one coil (e.g., coil <b>450</b><i>c</i>) that is parallel to the y-axis, and one coil (e.g., coil <b>450</b><i>e</i>) that is parallel to the z-axis. Also, in alternative embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> can include fewer or more than three sets of coils <b>450</b>, which each set having one or more coils <b>450</b>. In further embodiments, the orientation and position of the coils <b>450</b> can be different from that shown. For example, in other embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> can include coils <b>450</b> that are not orthogonal relative to each other. In the illustrated embodiments, the coils <b>450</b> are illustrated as being located within the structure <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, instead of placing the coils <b>450</b> inside the structure <b>12</b>, some or all of the coils <b>450</b> can be secured within the arm <b>30</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b>, the patient support system <b>200</b>, the device <b>166</b>, or a separate structure (not shown) that is adjacent to the radiation system <b>10</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, the device <b>166</b> may include an electron accelerator that may remain on while the radiation source <b>40</b> is used to deliver radiation to the patient <b>116</b>. In such cases, the electromagnetic field created by the coil(s) <b>450</b> is used to compensate (e.g., reduce) interference associated with a magnetic field of the accelerator in the device <b>166</b>. In other embodiments, a magnetic field of an accelerator in the radiation system <b>10</b> may interfere with an operation of the device <b>166</b> (especially if the device <b>166</b> includes a radiation source). In such cases, the electromagnetic field created by the coil(s) <b>450</b> is used to compensate (e.g., reduce) interference resulted from a magnetic field of the accelerator in the radiation system <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the magnetic field created by the coil(s) <b>450</b> can be used to compensate interference effects due to other components, such as a positioner of a patient support system.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, the generator <b>452</b> is coupled to a processor, such as the processor <b>84</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, which controls an operation of the generator <b>452</b>. In other embodiments, instead of using the processor <b>84</b>, the generator <b>452</b> can be coupled to the processor <b>134</b>, or a separate processor, which controls an operation of the generator <b>452</b>. The processor <b>84</b>/<b>134</b> can be configured (e.g., programmed) to provide activation signals to the generator <b>452</b> to cause the generator <b>452</b> to activate certain coil(s) <b>450</b> during an operation of the radiation system <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, instead of, or in addition to, providing activation signals, the processor <b>84</b>/<b>134</b> can be configured to determine an amount of current to be delivered to each of the coil(s) <b>450</b> to be activated.

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In any of the embodiments of the radiation system <b>10</b> described herein, the radiation system <b>10</b> can further include a protective guard <b>500</b> for protecting the patient <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). The guard <b>500</b> can be made from any material, such as carbon fiber, as long as it allows at least some of the radiation from the radiation source <b>40</b> to be transmitted therethrough. In the illustrated embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> has a circular cylindrical shape, but can have other cylindrical shapes in other embodiments. Also, in other embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> can be a partial cylinder (e.g., have an arc shape cross section) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">During use, the guard <b>500</b> is placed between the patient <b>116</b> and the radiation source <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>). The guard <b>500</b> protects the patient <b>116</b> from being collided with the radiation source <b>40</b> or the arm <b>30</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b> as the radiation source <b>40</b> is rotating about the patient <b>116</b>. The guard <b>500</b> also allows the arm <b>30</b> (and therefore, the radiation source <b>40</b>) to be rotated about the patient <b>116</b> at a faster speed without the risk of injuring the patient <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> is detachably coupled to the radiation system <b>10</b>.

In other embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> is detachably coupled to the patient support system <b>200</b>. In such cases, when the guard <b>500</b> is not used, the guard <b>500</b> can be detached from the patient support system <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> is rotatably secured (e.g., via one or more hinges) to the radiation system <b>10</b>, which allows the guard <b>500</b> to be opened or closed relative to the radiation system <b>10</b> between uses. In further embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> is slidably secured to the radiation system <b>10</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> can be slid along the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b> to thereby exposed the patient support <b>201</b> such that a patient <b>116</b> can be placed on the patient support <b>201</b>. After the patient <b>116</b> is placed on the patient support <b>201</b>, the guard <b>500</b> can then be slid to a closed position, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>. In further embodiments, the guard <b>500</b> can be coupled (e.g., slidably secured, rotatably secured, or detachably secured) to the patient support <b>201</b>, which allows the guard <b>500</b> to be positioned in conjunction with the patient support <b>201</b>. In such cases, if the patient support <b>201</b> is translated along the axis <b>46</b> of the bore <b>22</b>, the guard <b>500</b> will move with the patient support <b>201</b>. In some embodiments, if the patient support <b>201</b> is positioned between the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>, and the second operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>, the guard <b>500</b> that is coupled to the patient support <b>201</b> will move with the patient support <b>201</b>. In the case in which the device <b>166</b> includes a moving part, such as a rotating gantry, the guard <b>500</b> can also protect the patient <b>116</b> from being collided with the moving component of the device <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In some embodiments, if the guard <b>500</b> is coupled to the patient support <b>201</b>, the guard <b>500</b> can be made sufficiently small such that it can fit within the bore <b>22</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b> in different orientations. Such allows the patient <b>116</b> to be treated in different non-coplanar manners. In other embodiments, if the guard <b>500</b> is coupled to the radiation system <b>10</b>, the cross sectional size of the guard <b>500</b> (and the bore <b>22</b>) can be made sufficiently large to allow the patient support <b>201</b> to be oriented in a non-coplanar manner within the guard <b>500</b>. In further embodiments, when treating the patient <b>116</b> in a non-coplanar manner, the guard <b>500</b> is decoupled (or retracted) from the radiation system <b>10</b> and/or the patient support <b>201</b>, and is not used.</p>

In such cases, the structure <b>12</b> of the radiation system <b>10</b> can further include a PET device secured next to the ring gantry. For example, the PET device may comprise imagers <b>600</b><i>a </i>and <b>600</b><i>b </i>attached to a ring. The radiation source <b>40</b> and the imager <b>606</b> may also be secured to the same ring.

In such cases, the collimator next to the radiation source <b>40</b> may be opened to provide an imaging window for allowing the imaging radiation to pass therethrough. The PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>can be used to obtain PET image data of a portion of the patient while the patient is at the first operative position. Such feature is advantageous in that it allows PET image data from the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b</i>, and image data from the imager <b>606</b>, to be collected without moving the patient support. The imagers <b>600</b><i>a </i>and <b>600</b><i>b </i>can be rotated to obtain data at a plurality of angular positions, to provide more data for volumetric reconstruction.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> can be used with the device <b>166</b>, as similarly discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. During use, the patient can be placed at the operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>, and the device <b>166</b> can be used to create a treatment plan for the patient. At least a portion of the patient is then transferred from the operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>, through the bore <b>22</b> and the bore <b>56</b>, to the operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>, where the patient can be treated and/or imaged by the radiation source <b>40</b> and/or the imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b</i>, or by the imaging devices <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In other embodiments, instead of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the radiation system <b>10</b> does not include the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>). Instead, the radiation system <b>10</b> is used with, or includes, the device <b>166</b>, which includes PET imager(s) (for example, the device <b>166</b> may include two PET imagers (or multiple sets of two imagers) secured to a ring and positioned opposite from each other, or alternatively, the device <b>166</b> may include a PET imager having a stationary ring configuration. In such cases, the patient is positioned at the second operative position associated with the device <b>166</b>, and the PET imager(s) are used to obtain PET image data of a portion of the patient. The portion of the patient is then positioned through the bore <b>22</b> of the structure <b>12</b> and through the bore <b>56</b> of the arm <b>30</b> until it is at the first operative position associated with the radiation source <b>40</b>. The radiation source <b>40</b> then delivers low dose radiation beam to obtain image data (e.g., using the imager <b>606</b>) of the portion of the patient. In other embodiments, the image data can be obtained before the PET image data. The configuration of the radiation system <b>10</b> should not be limited to the examples discussed previously, and that the radiation system <b>10</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. For example, in other embodiments, instead of having the arm <b>30</b>, the radiation system <b>10</b> can have a ring gantry with a slip-ring configuration. Also, in other embodiments, instead of, or in addition to, PET imagers, the device <b>166</b> can include one or more SPECT imagers. Similarly, in other embodiments, imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>and/or <b>606</b> may be SPECT imagers.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In any of the embodiments described herein, image data obtained using the imager <b>606</b> can be used to perform attenuation correction for the PET image data (to correct attenuation effect in PET). This is advantageous because PET photons, having an energy of approximately 511 keV, undergo significant Compton scattering, while attenuation of x-rays of typical diagnostic sources generally are dominated by the photoelectric effect. Photons from the treatment beam are typically in the MeV range, and like the PET photons, the attenuation is dominated by Compton scattering. Thus, the attenuation data from the treatment beam may provide a better measure of attenuation. In addition, since a PET image may not provide a desired image resolution, the image data obtained using the imager <b>606</b> can be used to correct certain features of the PET image data. In some embodiments, the image data (whether from imager <b>606</b> or other imaging device) and the PET image data are combined to form a composite image, which may be used for treatment planning and/or for treatment evaluation. The composite image may be used during a treatment process. For example, the composite image may be used to verify a location of a target tissue region and/or to show the areas where a tumor is actively growing. As a further exemplary alternative, the imaging devices <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may be used to obtain data for attenuation correction, and/or for use in forming a composite image.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Various techniques may be employed for collecting the image data from the imager <b>606</b> and the PET image data from the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b</i>. For example, in some embodiments, the radiation source <b>40</b> and the imager <b>606</b> may be rotated around the patient to collect a plurality of image data at a plurality of gantry angles. Afterwards, the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>are then used to collect PET image data. In some cases, the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>may be rotated around the patient to collect a desired set of PET image data. If a ring-shape PET imager is used (instead of the set of PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b</i>), then the ring-shape PET imager needs not be rotated. In other embodiments, instead of collecting the image data before the PET image data, the PET image data may be collected first, followed by the image data from the imager <b>606</b>. In further embodiments, a set of image data from the imager <b>606</b> and PET image data from the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>may be collected at a first gantry angle. The gantry is then rotated to thereby collect another set of image data from the imager <b>606</b> and PET image data from the PET imagers <b>600</b><i>a</i>, <b>600</b><i>b </i>at a second gantry angle. The rotation of the gantry, and the collection of image and PET image data are continued, until a desired amount of image data and/or PET image data is collected. The collected image data and PET image data are transmitted to a processor, such as the processor <b>84</b>, which processes the image data and the PET image data. In some embodiments, the processor uses the image data to perform attenuation correction for the PET image data, as discussed herein. In other embodiments, the processor may use the image data and the PET image data to construct a composite image, as also discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> illustrates a radiation system <b>10</b> in accordance with other embodiments. The radiation system <b>10</b> includes the structure <b>12</b>, which has the first side <b>14</b>, the second side, the first opening <b>18</b> located on the first side <b>14</b>, the second opening <b>20</b> located on the second side, and the bore <b>22</b> extending between the openings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the radiation system <b>10</b> further includes a first ring <b>630</b><i>a</i>, and a second ring <b>630</b><i>b</i>. Each of the rings <b>630</b><i>a</i>, <b>630</b><i>b </i>may be a complete ring or a partial ring (e.g., an arc). The rings <b>630</b><i>a</i>, <b>630</b><i>b </i>are independently rotatable relative to the structure <b>12</b>, thereby allowing the rings <b>630</b><i>a</i>, <b>630</b><i>b </i>to rotate at different speeds. Each of the rings <b>630</b> can be used to carry-different devices. In the illustrated embodiments, the first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>may be used to carry a treatment radiation source (such as an embodiment of the radiation source <b>40</b> described herein), and the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>may be used to carry an x-ray tube <b>640</b> and an imager <b>642</b> (which for example, may be components of a CT device). The first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>is also used to carry the imager <b>50</b>, such that image data can be obtained using the treatment radiation source <b>40</b> and the imager <b>50</b>. In any embodiment, the first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>can have one or more diagnostic sources, and one or more imagers. During use, the first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>can rotate at a first speed to treat a patient and/or to generate image data using the radiation source and the imager, and the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>can rotate at a second speed to generate CT image data using the x-ray tube <b>640</b> and the imager <b>642</b>, wherein the first and the second speeds are different. In some embodiments, the CT device on the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>can be used to obtain an image of a portion of a patient while the patient is being treated using the radiation source <b>40</b> on the first ring <b>630</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">It should be noted that the devices that can be attached to the rings <b>630</b><i>a</i>, <b>630</b><i>b </i>are not limited to the examples discussed previously. For example, in other embodiments, a diagnostic device, such as a PET device (e.g., PET imager(s)), can be secured to the second ring <b>630</b><i>b</i>. In such cases, the image data obtained from the imager on the first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>may be used to perform attenuation correction for PET image obtained using the PET device on the second ring <b>630</b><i>b</i>, or may be used with the PET image data to form a composite image. The first and the second rings <b>630</b><i>a</i>, <b>630</b><i>b </i>can be configured to rotate at the same speed or different speeds to obtain a desired result. Also, in some embodiments, the first ring <b>630</b><i>a </i>can be configured to rotate by a first range of gantry angle to perform a first procedure, and the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>can be configured to rotate by a second range of gantry angle to perform a second procedure. The first and the second range may be the same or different, and may or may not overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In further embodiments, the PET device may include a ring-shape PET imager. In such cases, the radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> includes one ring <b>630</b><i>a</i>, and does not include a second rotatable ring. For example, the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>may be fixedly secured to the structure <b>12</b> such that the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>is not rotatable relative to the structure <b>12</b>, and may be used as a support to which the ring-shape PET imager is mounted. The ring-shape PET imager is secured within the bore <b>22</b> next to the first ring <b>630</b><i>a</i>. During use, image data are obtained using the radiation source <b>40</b> and the imager <b>50</b> mounted on the first ring <b>630</b><i>a</i>, and the image data may be used to correct attenuation effect in PET image data obtained using the ring-shape PET imager.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In further embodiments, the second ring <b>630</b><i>b </i>may carry a component, such as an imager, that is a part of an imaging device.

In some embodiments, the first device <b>700</b> may be any of the embodiments of the radiation systems <b>10</b> (e.g., any of the devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>) described herein. In other embodiments, the first device <b>700</b> may be a treatment machine or a diagnostic machine having other configurations. For example, the first device <b>700</b> may be a radiation treatment machine that does not have the through bore <b>22</b>. Also, in some embodiments, the second device <b>702</b> may be any of the embodiments of the devices <b>166</b> (or device <b>100</b>) described herein, or any treatment or diagnostic device not described herein. By means of non-limiting examples, the second device <b>702</b> may be a CT device (e.g., a CBCT device), a laminar tomography device, a MRI device, a fluoroscope, an angiography device, a PET device, a SPECT device, a PET-CT device, or a tomosynthesis imaging device. During use, the patient positioning system <b>200</b> places a patient in a first operative position associated with the first device <b>700</b> to allow a first procedure, such as a treatment procedure, be performed on at least a portion of the patient. The patient positioning system <b>200</b> then places the patient in a second operative position associated with the second device <b>702</b> to allow a second procedure, such as an imaging procedure, be performed on at least a portion of the patient. As illustrated in the embodiments, orienting the devices <b>700</b>, <b>702</b> 90&#xb0; relative to each other is advantageous in that it allows a patient to be transported between two devices in a relatively short distance. Also, such placement of the first and second devices <b>700</b>, <b>702</b> may allow them to be placed in a room having limited dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The radiation system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref> is not limited to the configuration shown.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of a radiation beam generator <b>750</b> for providing the radiation beam <b>42</b> in accordance with some embodiments. The radiation beam generator <b>750</b> may be implemented in any of the embodiments of the radiation system <b>10</b> described herein. The radiation beam generator <b>750</b> includes a particle source <b>752</b> (e.g., an electron generator) for generating particles (e.g., electrons), the accelerator <b>31</b> for accelerating the particles, and a permanent magnet system <b>754</b> for altering a trajectory of the particles. The permanent magnet system <b>754</b> includes one or more permanent magnet(s). In the illustrated embodiments, the permanent magnet system <b>754</b> changes a direction of the beam by approximately 270&#xb0;. Use of a permanent magnet system <b>754</b> to change the trajectory of the beam is advantageous because it allows the overall size of the radiation beam generator <b>750</b> be reduced (as compared to use of an electromagnetic system, which would increase the size of the generator <b>750</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In some embodiments, the radiation beam generator <b>750</b> may further include one or more electromagnet(s) to alter a characteristic of the magnetic field provided by the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>. In such cases, the electromagnetic coils may magnetically couple with the permanent magnetic to make changes (e.g., 30% or less) in the magnetic field that is used to bend the beam. For example, the electromagnet(s) may be configured (e.g., sized, shaped, and positioned relative to the permanent magnet <b>754</b>) to provide a magnetic field to change a magnitude and/or a direction of the magnetic field provided by the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>, thereby allowing the generated beam to be &#x201c;bent&#x201d; in a desired manner. The electromagnet(s) may be positioned adjacent to the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>, or connected to the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>. In other embodiments, instead of using electromagnet(s), the radiation beam generator <b>750</b> may include one or more additional permanent magnet(s) for adjusting a magnetic field provided by the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>. For example, the additional permanent magnet may be secured to a positioner that moves the additional permanent magnet relative to the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>, thereby changing a magnitude and/or a direction of the magnetic field provided by the permanent magnet system <b>754</b>. In other embodiments, other techniques known in the art may be used to vary the magnetic coupling of a magnetic material or magnet in the magnetic circuit to thereby provide the magnetic trimming functionality.</p>

Those skilled in the art will know how to prepare such instructions based on the functions and methods described herein. Such instructions may be read into the main memory <b>806</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <b>810</b>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory <b>806</b> causes the processor <b>804</b> to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory <b>806</b>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention.

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor <b>804</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system <b>800</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to the bus <b>802</b> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on the bus <b>802</b>.
