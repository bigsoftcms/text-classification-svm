<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a preferred embodiment hereof, this invention provides a pedorthic system, relating to at least one pedorthic adapted to assist at least one patient requiring lower limb immobilization in order to walk, comprising: insole means for supporting to at least one lower limb in such at least one pedorthic; inner lining means for inner lining such at least one pedorthic, wherein such inner lining means substantially surrounds at least such insole means and the lower limb; wherein such inner lining means substantially surrounds at least such insole means and the lower limb; padding means for padding such at least one pedorthic, wherein said padding means substantially surrounds said inner lining means; stiffener means for stiffly supporting the lower limb in such at least one pedorthic; wherein such stiffener means substantially surrounds such padding means, and wherein such stiffener means extends forward substantially to the toe-end of such at least one pedorthic along the bottom of such at least one pedorthic; balancer means for balancing such at least one pedorthic, wherein such balancer means substantially underlies such stiffener means on the bottom of such at least one pedorthic; spring means for springing such at least one pedorthic, wherein such spring means substantially underlies such balancer means; outer lining means for outer lining such at least one pedorthic, wherein such outer lining means substantially covers the exterior surface of such at least one pedorthic; and closure means for closing such at least one pedorthic.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, it provides such a pedorthic support system, further comprising resilient unitary filler means for filling at least one void exterior to such inner lining means, and for molding to the shape of such exterior of such inner lining means. Additionally, it provides such a pedorthic support system, further comprising sole means for soling such at least one pedorthic, wherein such sole means substantially underlies such spring means on the bottom of such at least one pedorthic. Also, it provides such a pedorthic support system, further comprising midsole means for mid-soling such at least one pedorthic, wherein such midsole means substantially underlies such spring means on the bottom of such at least one pedorthic, and wherein such sole means substantially underlies such midsole means.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another preferred embodiment hereof, this invention provides a pedorthic support system, relating to at least one pedorthic adapted to assist at least one patient requiring lower limb immobilization in order to walk, comprising: insole means for supporting to at least one lower limb in such at least one pedorthic, wherein such insole means comprises custom-molded insole means for custom-molding at least one resilient liner to the shape of the bottom of such at least one patient's lower limb; inner lining means for inner lining such at least one pedorthic wherein such inner lining means substantially surrounds at least such insole means and at least one portion of such at least one patient's lower limb, and wherein such inner lining means is custom shaped to fit around at least such insole means and at least one portion of such at least one patient's lower limb; padding means for padding such at least one pedorthic, wherein such padding means substantially surrounds such inner lining means; stiffener means for stiffly supporting the lower limb in such at least one pedorthic; wherein such stiffener means substantially surrounds such padding means, wherein such stiffener means is custom-molded to the shape of the underlying layers, and wherein such stiffener means extends forward substantially to the toe-end of such at least one pedorthic along the bottom of such at least one pedorthic; balancer means for balancing such at least one pedorthic, wherein such balancer means substantially underlies such stiffener means on the bottom of such at least one pedorthic; spring means for springing such at least one pedorthic, wherein such spring means substantially underlies such balancer means; outer lining means for outer lining such at least one pedorthic, wherein such outer lining means substantially covers the exterior surface of such at least one pedorthic; and closure means for closing such at least one pedorthic.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, it provides such a pedorthic support system, further comprising resilient, unitary filler means for filling at least one void exterior to such inner lining means, and for molding to the shape of such exterior of such inner lining means.
