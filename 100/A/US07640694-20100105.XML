<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> thereof, a new flower mounting device embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, the headstone flower mounting system <b>10</b> generally comprises a headstone <b>12</b> that has an upper edge <b>14</b>, a front side <b>16</b> and a back side <b>18</b>. The headstone <b>12</b> may be made out of any conventional material including but not limited to granite, marble and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A block <b>20</b> has a top side <b>22</b>, a bottom side <b>24</b>, a first end <b>26</b>, a second end <b>28</b>, a first lateral side <b>30</b>, a second lateral side <b>32</b>. The bottom side <b>24</b> of the block <b>20</b> abuts the upper edge <b>14</b> of the headstone <b>12</b>. The block <b>20</b> is comprised of a material capable of receiving flower <b>60</b> stems. The material of the block <b>12</b> may include a foamed plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A plurality of hook members <b>34</b> is extended into the block <b>20</b>. Each of the first <b>26</b> and second <b>28</b> ends has one of the plurality of hook members <b>34</b> therein. The first <b>26</b> and second <b>28</b> lateral sides have two of the hook members <b>34</b> therein. One of each of the hook members <b>34</b> in the first <b>30</b> and second <b>32</b> lateral sides is positioned adjacent to the first end <b>26</b> and one of each of the hook members <b>34</b> in the first <b>30</b> and second <b>32</b> lateral sides is positioned adjacent to the second end <b>28</b>. The hook members <b>34</b> may or may not include a closed loop structure. The hook members <b>34</b> each include a threaded rod <b>36</b> that is extendable into and threadably coupled to the block member <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A pair of eyebolts <b>38</b> is provided. Each of the eyebolts <b>38</b> extends into the upper edge <b>14</b> of the headstone <b>12</b>. The block <b>20</b> is positioned between the eyebolts <b>38</b> and each of the eyebolts <b>38</b> is positioned adjacent to one of the first <b>26</b> and second <b>28</b> ends. The eyebolts <b>38</b> may be extended into and directly coupled to the headstone <b>12</b>. However, a pair of inserts <b>40</b> may also be provided which are extended into the upper edge <b>14</b> of the headstone <b>12</b>. Each of the inserts <b>38</b> threadably receives one of the eyebolts <b>38</b>. When the eyebolts <b>38</b> are not in the inserts <b>40</b>, a flathead screw <b>42</b> may be positioned in the inserts <b>40</b> so that they are flush with the top edge <b>14</b>. If a user of the headstone <b>12</b> wants to attach the block <b>20</b>, the flathead screws <b>42</b> are removed and replaced with the eyebolts <b>38</b>. This allows holes to be drilled into the headstone <b>12</b> and plugged with the screws <b>42</b> during the fabrication of the headstone <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A plurality of bands <b>44</b> is provided. Each of the bands <b>44</b> is attached to and extends between one of the eyebolts <b>38</b> and one of the hook members <b>34</b> so that each of the hook members <b>34</b> has one of the bands <b>44</b> attached thereto. In particular, each of the eyebolts <b>38</b> has three bands <b>44</b> attached thereto as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In use, the block <b>20</b> is attached to the headstone <b>12</b> as described above and shown in the Figures. Once the block <b>20</b> is secured to the headstone <b>12</b>, a plurality of flowers <b>60</b> may be extended into the top side <b>22</b> of the block <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
