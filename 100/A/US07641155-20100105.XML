<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an arrangement for at least partially compensating for a torque caused by gravitational forces acting on a mass body which is rotatably supported on a holding unit. The invention further relates to a method for setting a torque balance state for a mass body which is rotatably supported on a holding unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">German patent publication 3,444,313 discloses a suspension mechanism for a surgical microscope. This suspension mechanism includes a spring for generating a linear force which compensates a torque caused by gravitational forces acting on the microscope. With a Bowden cable, the spring for generating the linear force is coupled to a gear wheel which is rigidly connected to the axis of rotation of the microscope. The suspension mechanism further includes adjusting means in the form of a gear shaft and a worm gear shaft which allow to adjust the amplitude and the phase of the compensating torque with respect to the torque caused by the gravitational forces.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,296, a suspension mechanism for a surgical microscope is known, which comprises a spiral spring compensating a torque generated by gravitational forces. The force of the spiral spring can be set by an adjustment screw.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,293 discloses the use of gas pressure springs in a link-parallelogram for generating a force which counteracts the gravitational forces acting on a microscope stand.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement for at least partially compensating a torque caused by gravitational forces acting on a surgical microscope which is rotatably supported on a stand unit thus allowing for a zero force movement of the surgical microscope about an axis of rotation which is at a distance from the center of mass of the surgical microscope. It is another object of the invention to provide a user friendly method of balancing a surgical microscope which is rotatably supported on a holding unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above object is achieved by providing an arrangement for at least partially compensating a load-torque acting on a mass body which is rotatably supported on a holding unit. The arrangement includes: linear force generating means for generating a linear force; converter means for converting the linear force into a torque; and, a coupling unit which couples the converter means to the mass body. The coupling unit is adjustable to permit setting a torque transmitted from the converter means to the mass body. The coupling unit for transmitting a torque from the converter means to the mass body allows for coupling and decoupling of the converter means and the mass body. Preferably, the coupling unit allows not only for coupling and decoupling the mass body and the converter means but also for adjusting the phase of a torque acting on the converter means and the actual torque which is transmitted from the converter means to the mass body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the arrangement of the invention provides a compensating torque which automatically has a correct phase position with respect to the torque caused by the gravitational forces acting on the center of mass of the mass body which is rotatably supported on the stand unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the converter means include a crank mechanism to convert a linear force into a torque with only little friction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the crank mechanism includes a crank member coupled to the linear force generating means, which has an arm of adjustable length. In varying the arm length of the crank member, the amplitude of a compensating torque as generated by the linear force generating means can be adjusted to a torque which is caused by gravitational forces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the crank mechanism in the arrangement comprises a threaded spindle for adjusting the arm length of the crank member. This allows setting the amplitude of a compensating torque in a very precise way.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the arrangement of the invention further includes a latch mechanism for adjusting the phase of a compensating torque transmitted to the mass body. This allows for the transmission of relatively large torques from the converter means to the mass body.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, this latch mechanism includes a latch wheel having detent bores for accommodating a latch pin. This mechanism allows for little wear while coupling the converter means and the mass body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the latch mechanism further includes holding means for holding the latch pin and a slot for guiding the holding means, wherein movement of the holding means in the slot allows for coupling and decoupling of the mass body and the converter means. This allows for actuating the coupling means by setting the length of a crank arm in the converter means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the coupling unit includes a threaded spindle meshing with a gear rim for adjusting the phase of a compensating torque transmitted to the mass body.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The linear force generating means can include a gas pressure spring. Such a gas pressure spring can provide push or pull forces. They allow for a relatively low weight of the arrangement while providing relatively high linear forces for the generation of compensating torques.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method for setting a torque balance state of a mass body, which is rotatably supported on a stand unit, includes the steps of: decoupling the mass body from the converter means arranged for converting a linear force generated by a linear force generating means into a torque; allowing the mass body to be driven into a stable equilibrium state by gravity; allowing the converter means to be driven into an equilibrium state by the linear force generating means; and, coupling the mass body and the converter means in the stable equilibrium state of the mass body and the stable equilibrium state of the converter means. In this way, an equilibrium state for a surgical microscope can be set which is rotatably supported on a stand. By adjusting the length of a crank arm after coupling the mass body and the transformer means, very accurate compensation of the compensating torque and the torque caused by the gravitational forces acting on the mass body of a surgical microscope can be achieved.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The arrangement for at least partially compensating a torque caused by gravitational forces includes a surgical microscope <b>2</b> which forms a mass body rotatably supported on a rotational axis <b>3</b> by a freewheel bearing (not shown). The surgical microscope <b>2</b> has a center of mass <b>4</b> located outside of the rotational axis <b>3</b>. The location of the center of mass <b>4</b> is determined by the arrangement of the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. This arrangement changes by attaching additional instruments, as for example, units allowing for co-observation or cameras. The gravitational force acts on the center of mass <b>4</b> of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> and generates a torque which tends to move the surgical microscope <b>2</b> into a stable equilibrium position. This stable equilibrium position corresponds to a location of the center of mass <b>4</b> of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> below the axis of the rotation <b>3</b> on the vertical perpendicular to this axis. In this position, the gravitational forces acting on the surgical microscope <b>2</b> cause zero torque. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the weight of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> acts at the center of mass S and generates a load torque about the axis of rotation <b>3</b> in the counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A gas pressure spring <b>5</b> is provided for compensating the torque generated by the gravitational forces in the arrangement <b>1</b>. Instead of providing a gas pressure spring <b>5</b>, a gas pull spring, a pull or pressure spring as, for example, a spiral spring or some other corresponding energy storing means could be used which allows for generating a linear force.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A ball and socket joint <b>6</b> bears the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> on a stand not shown in detail. The gas pressure spring <b>5</b> is connected to a converter unit <b>7</b> which transforms a linear force generated by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> into a compensating torque. This compensating torque compensates a load-torque caused by the gravitational forces acting on the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. The converter unit <b>7</b> includes a crank mechanism encompassing a slot stone <b>14</b> which is carried by a threaded spindle <b>11</b>. This slot stone <b>14</b> has a connecting arm <b>15</b> which is connected to the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>. The threaded spindle <b>11</b> and the slot stone <b>14</b> therefore act as a crank arm which tends to carry out a rotational movement about the axis of rotation <b>3</b> because of the linear force provided by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the linear force applied by the spring <b>5</b> acts to the right of the rotational axis <b>3</b> and the converter unit defines a moment arm so that the torque generated by spring <b>5</b> acts in a clockwise direction or opposite to the counterclockwise direction of the load torque generated by the force of the weight of the microscope acting at the center of mass <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An adjustable coupling unit is provided for coupling the crank arm to the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. This coupling unit includes a latch mechanism which encompasses a latch wheel <b>8</b> having bores <b>9</b>. This latch wheel <b>8</b> is rigidly connected to the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a latch pin <b>10</b> is shown engaging one of the bores <b>9</b>. By means of this latch pin <b>10</b>, a compensating torque generated by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> is transmitted from the converter unit <b>7</b> to the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. The effective length of the crank arm in the converter unit <b>7</b> can be adjusted by rotating the threaded spindle <b>11</b>. For this, a turning knob <b>12</b> is provided on the threaded spindle <b>11</b> which permits rotating the threaded spindle <b>11</b> in a threaded bore <b>13</b> formed in lever arm structure <b>40</b>. By rotating the threaded spindle <b>11</b> in the threaded bore <b>13</b>, the position of the slot stone <b>14</b> and thus the effective length of the crank arm, which is acted upon by the spring force of the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> via the connecting arm <b>15</b>, can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The latch pin <b>10</b> is held by a holding member <b>17</b> which is guided by the threaded spindle <b>11</b> via a guide slot <b>16</b> formed in the slot stone <b>14</b>.

By moving the slot stone <b>14</b>, the position of the holding means <b>17</b> in the guide slot <b>16</b> is changed. Corresponding to the position of the slot stone <b>14</b>, the effective length of the crank arm, which is exposed to the force of the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>, is varied and correspondingly different compensating torques are generated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The guide slot <b>16</b> in the slot stone <b>14</b> includes a first section <b>18</b>, where the guide slot <b>16</b> is perpendicular to the axis of rotation <b>3</b>. In a second section <b>19</b>, the guide slot <b>16</b> follows a direction forming an angle with respect to the rotational axis <b>3</b>. By varying the position of the slot stone, the holding member <b>17</b>, with the latch pin <b>10</b> attached thereto, is moved in the guide slot <b>16</b> in the direction of the axis of rotation <b>3</b>. In this way, the latch pin <b>10</b> is coupled to the latch wheel <b>8</b> or decoupled therefrom. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a position the surgical microscope <b>2</b> assumes when the latch pin <b>10</b> is decoupled from the latch wheel <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, it can be seen that the latch pin <b>10</b> is seated in the detent bore <b>9</b> of the latch wheel <b>8</b> which is fixedly attached to the surgical microscope <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The length of the moment arm of the compensating torque is changed by moving the slot stone <b>14</b> with this movement being relative to the holding member <b>17</b>.

In the second section <b>19</b>, the guide slot <b>16</b> follows a direction forming an angle with respect to the rotational axis <b>3</b>. When the slot stone <b>14</b> is moved so far to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>, the holding member <b>17</b> enters the second section <b>19</b> of guide slot <b>16</b> whereat the side wall of the second section <b>19</b> acts as a cam to move the holding member <b>17</b> with the latch pin <b>10</b> in the direction of the rotational axis <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the microscope is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the threaded spindle <b>11</b> may, as indicated by the circular arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, be turned so that the slot stone <b>14</b> including the connecting arm <b>15</b> is moved in the general direction of the straight arrow. Movement into the general direction of the straight arrow will lead to an engagement of the latch pin <b>10</b> with the suitable bore <b>9</b> of the latch wheel <b>8</b>. This engagement, in turn, results in an effective connection between the surgical microscope <b>2</b> and the converter unit <b>7</b>. After this effective connection has been established and through adjustment of the threaded spindle <b>11</b>, the connecting arm <b>15</b> may be moved through the rotational axis <b>3</b> around which the surgical microscope is pivotable (see phantom outline of connecting arm <b>15</b>). This allows an adjustment of the phase and amplitude via the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> to compensate for the torque exerted on the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. Thus, by changing the position of the slot stone <b>14</b> and by appropriately choosing the bore in the latch wheel <b>8</b> in which the latch pin <b>10</b> is accommodated, a compensating torque, which is generated by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>, can be adapted in phase and amplitude to a given load torque generated by gravitational forces acting at the center of mass <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a position of the surgical microscope in which torque compensation has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the relationship between a shift of the center of mass and the corresponding change in torque generated by gravitational forces for the surgical microscope <b>21</b> supported on an axis of rotation <b>20</b>.

The gravitational force acting at the center of mass acts on the axis of rotation <b>20</b> with a lever arm <b>23</b> of length a<sub>1 </sub>and generates a load-torque M<sub>L1 </sub>about this axis. If additional instruments are provided on the surgical microscope <b>21</b>, as for example a video camera, additional lenses or modules attached in front of the main objective lens, the center of mass is shifted from position <b>22</b> to position <b>24</b>. The change in the total mass of the surgical microscope system and the inherent shift of the center of mass give rise to a corresponding change of the torque as generated by gravity.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0055">A change in the total mass of the surgical microscope and a shift of its center of mass changes, in general, the torque which arises at the axis of rotation <b>20</b>. In order to allow a zero force movement of the surgical microscope system about the axis of rotation <b>20</b>, a corresponding adaptation of the phase and amplitude of the compensating torque is required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows with curve <b>31</b> a dependence of the load-torque M<sub>L </sub>caused by gravity on the angular position &#x3b1; of a surgical microscope on an axis of rotation. For complete compensation of this torque, a compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>is required having a phase and amplitude which is adapted to the torque M<sub>L </sub>such that the compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>and the torque M<sub>L </sub>cancel each other. If the compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>at the surgical microscope follows the curve <b>32</b>, the surgical microscope is in equilibrium irrespective of its angular position with respect to its axis of rotation on which it is supported. In this way, it is possible to move the surgical microscope about this axis of rotation at virtually zero force.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">In the following it will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, how, for a given torque M<sub>L </sub>caused by gravity, a corresponding compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>can be set. For this, in a first step, the surgical microscope <b>2</b> is decoupled from the converter unit <b>7</b> and the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> by opening the latch mechanism. As a consequence thereof, the surgical microscope tilts under the action of gravity about the axis of rotation <b>3</b> and moves into a stable equilibrium position. In this stable equilibrium position, the center of mass <b>4</b> of the system is on the vertical perpendicular to the axis of rotation <b>3</b>. At the same time, the converter unit <b>7</b> is driven into stable equilibrium position by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>, in which the spring arm of the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> and the crank arm of the converter unit <b>7</b> (formed by the slot stone <b>14</b> and the threaded spindle <b>11</b>) are aligned parallel to each other. When the latching unit is closed in these mutually corresponding stable equilibrium positions of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> and the converter unit <b>7</b> with the gas pressure spring <b>5</b>, then the load-torque M<sub>L </sub>caused by the surgical microscope <b>2</b> and the compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>generated by the gas pressure spring <b>5</b> are shifted in phase by 180&#xb0;. By rotating the threaded spindle <b>11</b>, the effective length of the crank arm in the converter unit <b>7</b> is then set so that the amplitude of this compensating torque M<sub>K </sub>is adapted to the amplitude of the load-torque M<sub>L </sub>generated by gravity. The result is a complete torque balance for the surgical microscope <b>2</b> on the axis of rotation <b>3</b> irrespective of angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment <b>40</b> of an arrangement for at least partially compensating a torque as an alternative to the arrangement presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The arrangement <b>40</b> encompasses a surgical microscope <b>41</b> defining a mass unit supported on an axis of rotation <b>42</b> by a freewheel bearing (not shown). In position A, the surgical microscope <b>41</b> has a center of mass which lies outside the axis of rotation <b>42</b> at a location <b>43</b>. As shown in the arrangement <b>1</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the position of the center of mass of the arrangement <b>40</b> is determined by the mass distribution of the surgical microscope <b>41</b> and additional instruments which are attached to it. The gravitational force acting on the center of mass of the surgical microscope <b>41</b> generates a load-torque which tends to move the surgical microscope <b>41</b> from a position A into a stable equilibrium position. This stable equilibrium position corresponds to a position A&#x2032; of the surgical microscope shown in phantom outline with the center of mass <b>43</b>&#x2032; lying below the axis of rotation <b>42</b> on a vertical line perpendicular to axis <b>42</b>. In this position, the gravitational forces acting on the surgical microscope <b>41</b> generate no torque on the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">For compensating the load-torque, the arrangement <b>40</b> includes a gas pressure spring <b>44</b>, which may be used for generating a linear force. The spring <b>44</b> could also be a gas tension spring, a tension or pressure spring formed as a helical spring or some other corresponding energy storing means.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">The gas pressure spring <b>44</b> is rotatably connected to a stand unit by a ball joint <b>45</b>. This gas pressure spring <b>44</b> is connected to a converter unit <b>46</b> configured as a crank mechanism, which converts a linear force provided by the gas pressure spring <b>44</b> into a compensating torque. Similar to the converter unit <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this crank mechanism includes a crank block <b>47</b> and a threaded spindle <b>48</b> which is guided in a threaded bore <b>49</b> of the crank block <b>47</b>. The gas pressure spring <b>44</b> acts on the crank block <b>47</b> via a connecting arm <b>50</b>. The threaded spindle <b>48</b> has a turning knob and is rotatably journalled in a bearing <b>51</b> in unit <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0061">The threaded spindle <b>48</b> and the crank block <b>47</b> conjointly define a crank arm which tends to carry out a rotation movement about the axis of rotation <b>42</b> under the linear force provided by the gas pressure spring <b>44</b>. By rotating the threaded spindle <b>48</b>, the length of this crank arm can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0062">The compensating torque provided by the converter unit is conducted to the surgical microscope <b>41</b> via an adjustable coupling unit where it balances the torque generated by gravitational forces on the surgical microscope <b>41</b>. The coupling unit is in the form of a worm gear. For this, a worm gear <b>54</b> is provided which is journalled in another bearing <b>43</b> on the unit <b>52</b>. The worm gear <b>54</b> can be rotated by a turning knob <b>55</b>. The worm gear <b>54</b> meshes with a rim gear or pinion <b>56</b> provided on a connecting wheel <b>57</b> which is fixedly connected to the surgical microscope <b>41</b>. This connecting wheel <b>57</b> transmits a compensating torque to the surgical microscope <b>41</b>, which is generated by the gas pressure spring <b>44</b> and the crank block <b>47</b> with the threaded spindle <b>48</b>. By turning the worm gear <b>54</b>, the surgical microscope <b>41</b> is tilted about the axis of rotation <b>42</b>. In this way, it is possible to adjust the phase position of a compensating torque with respect to a torque caused by gravitational forces acting on the surgical microscope <b>41</b> in a very precise way.</p>
