<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a an application claiming the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119(e) from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/632,653, filed Nov. 30, 2004, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of vacuum chambers, and more particularly, to a vacuum chamber for use with viscous food processing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Commercial food products that include viscous materials are typically mixed in a tank. This process adds air to the resultant viscous food product. If the air in the viscous product is not effectively removed, the viscous product will be processed with the air and/or packaged along with the air. This inclusion of air may prohibit effective processing of the food product. Further, air in the food product may result in the food product settling to a lesser volume as the air is released from the product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an attempt to minimize the amount of air that is included in a liquid food product being processed, the liquid food product is sent through a vacuum chamber. Air in the liquid food product separates from the food product in the vacuum chamber and is removed by means of a vacuum pump. This system is effective for products of low viscosity such as milk. However, traditional vacuum chambers do not work well with a more viscous food product. Traditional vacuum chambers result in foaming of the viscous food product. Additionally, traditional vacuum chambers do not effectively remove the air from viscous food product. Accordingly, a vacuum chamber system that effectively removes air from viscous food product without causing foaming would be advantageous.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of the invention relates to a vacuum chamber having a vacuum tank with a product inlet and a product outlet. A circular sleeve is located within the vacuum tank creating a first zone between the sleeve and inner wall of the vacuum tank, and a second zone between the inner wall of the circular sleeve and the bottom of the vacuum tank. The product inlet is located within the first zone, and the product outlet is located within the second zone. A vacuum pump is connected to the vacuum tank to remove air from the food product as it moves from the first zone to the second zone.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect of the invention, a recirculation system is added to recirculate food product that exits from the second zone back into the first zone.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further embodiment a vacuum tank includes an inner wall and a first product inlet, a second product inlet, and a product outlet. A sleeve located within the tank includes an outer surface and an opposing inner surface. The sleeve defines a first zone between the inner wall of the tank and the outer surface of the sleeve, and a second zone between the inner surface of the sleeve and a bottom of the tank. A recirculation system includes a pump configured to return a portion of the food product to the first zone after the food product exits the tank through the product outlet. The tank includes a recirculation inlet located in the first zone. A vacuum pump is operatively connected to the tank in a region above the first and second zones and configured to remove air from the food product as the food product moves from the first zone to the product outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still a further aspect of the invention a method for removing air from a food product includes providing a fluid food product through a product inlet into a tank having a sleeve located therein. The food product is moved upwardly in the tank between an inner wall of the tank and an outer surface of the sleeve. The food product is then moved over an upper edge of the sleeve and downwardly over an inner surface of the sleeve. A vacuum in the tank is provided in a region above the upper edge of the sleeve and removes air from the food product as the food product moves over the upper edge of the sleeve.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a traditional vacuum chamber <b>10</b> includes a tank <b>12</b> having an upper portion <b>14</b> and a lower portion <b>16</b>. A vacuum connection <b>18</b> is located through the tank <b>12</b> in upper portion <b>14</b>. A vacuum pump is operatively secured to the vacuum connection <b>18</b> with a vacuum line. This maintains a vacuum within tank <b>12</b>. A product inlet <b>20</b> is located through the tank <b>12</b> in the upper portion <b>14</b> below the vacuum connection <b>18</b>. The food product is introduced tangentially into the tank <b>12</b> and circulates downwardly around the inner wall of tank <b>12</b> until it hits the surface <b>21</b> of product level within tank <b>12</b>. The food product falls by gravity and fills the lower part <b>16</b> of the tank <b>12</b>. The space occupied by the vacuum in the chamber is defined by the product surface <b>21</b> and the upper chamber design. The food product is therefore exposed to the vacuum while it is swirling around the inner wall of tank <b>12</b> and while it is on the surface of the product level <b>21</b> within tank <b>12</b>. Air that is in the food product is removed. This system is used with food products having lighter viscosity, such as milk. However with more viscous food products in this system, the food product may foam. This is particularly the case when the product comes directly from the formulation and has a lot of air in it. This foaming action is problematic. Further, when the food product is made from more than one food substance, it is important to ensure that the food product does not separate while it is in the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an agitator <b>22</b> is used to continuously mix the food product while it is in the tank <b>12</b>. This helps to ensure that the food product stays mixed. Further, to minimize the foaming of the food product, the food product is introduced in a product inlet <b>24</b> located below the upper product level <b>26</b>. While agitator <b>22</b> does succeed in ensuring that the food product remains mixed, and the location of food inlet <b>24</b> below the food product level <b>26</b> minimizes foaming, the amount of air removed form the food product is not optimal. Agitator <b>22</b> has a tendency to push the food product down toward the product outlet <b>27</b>, thereby shortening the amount of time that the food product is exposed to the vacuum. A significant amount of the food product will be pushed from product inlet <b>24</b> directly to the product outlet <b>27</b> without first reaching the surface of the food product level <b>26</b>. Where the food product is viscous the air will remain trapped within the food product and not be removed by the vacuum, especially where the food product is not exposed to the vacuum near the top surface of the product level <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a vacuum chamber <b>28</b> includes a tank <b>30</b> with a vacuum inlet <b>31</b> located proximate the top portion of tank <b>30</b>. Vacuum inlet <b>31</b> is operatively connected to a vacuum pump <b>78</b> with a vacuum line <b>32</b>. Tank <b>30</b> includes an upper region <b>36</b>, a lower region <b>38</b> and a cone shaped region <b>40</b> terminating at an outlet <b>42</b> through which the food product exits. A hollow cylindrical sleeve <b>44</b> is located within the lower region <b>38</b> and terminating within the cone shaped region <b>40</b>. Sleeve <b>44</b> includes an upper edge <b>46</b> and a lower edge <b>48</b>. Further, sleeve <b>44</b> includes an outer surface <b>50</b> and an inner surface <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, the lower edge <b>48</b> of sleeve <b>44</b> is welded to the inner surface <b>53</b> of the cone shaped region <b>40</b>. The sleeve <b>44</b> creates a first zone <b>56</b> between the inner surface of tank <b>30</b> and the outer surface <b>50</b> of sleeve <b>44</b>. A second zone <b>58</b> is formed by the inner surface <b>52</b> of sleeve <b>44</b> between the upper edge <b>46</b> and the portion of the cone region <b>40</b> located within the lower edge <b>48</b> of sleeve <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The food product enters the tank <b>30</b> via a food intake inlet <b>60</b> located in the lower region <b>38</b> proximate the cone shaped region <b>40</b> and tangential to the tank wall. The food product is then forced upwardly by, for example, a pump, in the first zone <b>56</b> in a circular motion. The food intake inlet <b>60</b> is located below the product surface level in the first zone, thereby minimizing foaming that may take place. The placement of sleeve <b>44</b> prevents short circuiting of the incoming food intake. Further, since the food product is forced through a circuitous route, the food product is mixed without the need for a separate agitator. However, a separate mixer/agitator could be added to the second region within the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A recirculation system <b>64</b> includes a recirculation pump <b>66</b> having a pump inlet <b>68</b> operatively connected in fluid communication with the exit tube <b>69</b> of tank <b>30</b>. A recirculation inlet or valve <b>70</b> is located within the lower portion of first zone <b>56</b>. A portion of the food product that exits outlet <b>42</b> is pumped through the recirculation system <b>64</b> back into tank <b>30</b>. The recirculated food product mixes with the initial food product entering tank <b>30</b> via product inlet <b>60</b>. As a result the initial food product is diluted so that the amount of air in the diluted food product is less than in the initial food product. As the diluted food product moves upward in the first zone into the second zone, the food product is located proximate the food product top surface <b>62</b> and therefore exposed to the vacuum in the upper region <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The result is that more air is removed from the food product that exits the tank <b>30</b> and is finally sent to be packaged or subsequently processed. This is possible because the submerged product inlet <b>60</b> brings a steady flow of product with a lot of air in it which is diluted and spread out by the recycled food product that has already been de-aerated. This recycled food product comes tangent with the lower part of the sleeve <b>44</b>, and a circular motion is imparted which forces the product around the lower level within the first zone <b>56</b>. Recycled product fills the space and then rises, picking up and mixing with the incoming product, spreading it as it rises with it.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mixture of incoming initial product through inlet <b>60</b> and recycled product through recirculation inlet <b>70</b> rises upward reaching the upper edge of sleeve <b>44</b> and goes over it. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an anti-swirl baffle <b>72</b> may be provided and located proximate the upper edge <b>46</b> of sleeve <b>44</b> to allow the mixture of food product to be exposed to the vacuum in upper region <b>36</b>. Baffle or plate <b>72</b> aids in generating vortexes increasing the level surfaces to the maximum and exposing more of the food product to the vacuum in region <b>36</b>. The resultant product has a minimal amount of air, enters the second zone <b>58</b>, and is subsequently removed through outlet <b>42</b>. A second anti-swirl baffle <b>74</b> may also be provided and located adjacent the outlet <b>42</b> to minimize swirling of the product within the second zone <b>58</b>. In a preferred embodiment, vacuum chamber <b>28</b> does not include any antiswirl baffles.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The amount of recycled food product that is recirculated back to tank <b>30</b> is adjusted by changing the speed of the recirculation pump <b>66</b>. In a preferred embodiment, recirculation pump <b>66</b> is a centrifugal pump which allows a sanitary way to drain this tank. The pumping action of recirculation pump <b>66</b> with its depressurization followed by pressurization assist in releasing air within the food product. The discharge of the recirculation pump <b>66</b> tangentially in tank <b>30</b> at the bottom of first zone <b>56</b> also contributes to more air being removed from the food product. If top antiswirl plate <b>72</b> is utilized, the amount of vortexes generated by top antiswirl plate <b>72</b> is adjustable by changing the product level in the chamber and/or by changing the recirculation pump speed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The introduction of recirculated food product into tank <b>30</b> forces the initial product introduced in inlet <b>60</b> to dilute in the stream. This has the effect of diluting the amount of air within the food product as well to provide a second opportunity for the food product to be exposed to the vacuum. The arrangement of the sleeve <b>44</b> allows the recycled product to swirl together with the fresh product entering inlet <b>60</b>. When the diluted or combined food product reaches the top of the sleeve <b>44</b>, the food product is swirling passing a gap then flowing as a thin film on <b>52</b> down to the level <b>62</b> in the cylinder zone. This exposes the product to the vacuum in a beneficial way effectively removing air from the food product. Since a portion of the food product exiting the tank <b>30</b> is recirculated, the product may be exposed several times to the vacuum thereby resulting in a food product that ultimately has little air. The location of the recirculation pump <b>66</b> and the location of the recirculation inlet or valve <b>70</b> proximate the bottom of the first zone <b>56</b> allows for easy cleaning when the tank <b>30</b> and system are being cleaned. The removal of air from the system in a tubular system increases the running time, since it helps in preventing protein from depositing or burn-on to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a clean-in-place nozzle <b>76</b> may also be included within tank <b>30</b> in the upper region to allow a cleaning agent to be introduced into the system to clean the system. Although the embodiments described relate to a food product, any viscous product that is being processed may be used in the system as a way of removing air. This new chamber and recirculation pump combines air removal and product agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a preferred embodiment sleeve <b>44</b> includes a conical shape such that the diameter of the sleeve proximate the upper edge <b>46</b> is greater than the diameter of the sleeve <b>44</b> proximate a bottom portion of the sleeve. The term conical as used herein does not require that the shape have a point and includes a frusto-conical shape. The sleeve <b>44</b> could also have other shapes such as a cylinder with a constant diameter or with other shapes where the cross section narrows from the upper edge toward the product outlet. The reduction in cross section permits the food product to flow in a thin layer for a distance providing the vacuum the opportunity to remove as much air as possible from the food product.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is important to note that the construction and arrangement of the system as shown in the various exemplary embodiments is illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail in this disclosure, those skilled in the art who review this disclosure will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible (e.g., variations in sizes, dimensions, structures, shapes and proportions of the various elements, values of parameters, mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors, orientations, etc.) without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the subject matter recited in the claims.
