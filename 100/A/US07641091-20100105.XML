<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to stapling apparatus. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a staple drive assembly for use in a staple cartridge of a stapling apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical stapling apparatus are widely used in surgical procedures to fasten body tissue quickly and efficiently by driving fasteners, or staples into the tissue. In certain types of stapling apparatus, a drive member moves transversely to the direction the staples are to be driven. Typically, such stapling apparatus employ a number of staple pusher elements located in grooved slots of a staple cartridge and arranged end to end in rows. Under normal operation, the transversely moving drive member contacts a cam member on the staple pusher thereby pushing the staple pusher vertically in the grooved slot. The staple pusher transmits linear motion from the drive member to the staples. The rows of staples are thereby driven into the body tissue to be fastened.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several issues arise in designing staple pushers for driving one or more surgical staples. If the forces applied to the staple pusher are not effectively balanced, there is a tendency for the staple pusher to twist within the grooved slot and/or bind against the walls of the grooved slot. Additionally, a single point of contact between the actuation sled and the staple pusher may create a rocking point on the staple pusher which can cause the staple pusher to exit the staple cartridge in an unbalanced manner which may result in non-uniform staple formation. Moreover, staple pushers for driving a plurality of staples may offer more resistance to longitudinal movement of the drive member. It is desirable that the staple pusher permit application of a relatively smooth ejection force throughout the operation of the drive member. It is also desirable that the stapling apparatus form a plurality of finished staples having a substantially uniform configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various staple pusher and cam bar arrangements are known. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,955,959; 4,978,049; 5,395,034; 5,630,541; 5,662,258; 6,131,789 and D278,081.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure is directed towards a staple drive assembly for use in a staple cartridge. The staple drive assembly includes an actuation sled and at least one staple pusher. The staple cartridge includes a tissue contacting surface having a number of retention slots wherein each retention slot is adapted for releasably receiving a staple. The staple cartridge may include a guide channel extending from a proximal portion to a distal portion along its longitudinal axis. In one embodiment, the staple cartridge is adapted for use in a surgical stapler having a drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The actuation sled includes a base, at least one camming member and a guide member. Each camming member includes a first or leading cam wedge and a second or trailing cam wedge. The leading and trailing cam wedges are laterally and longitudinally spaced apart from one another. Spacing of the cam wedges apart, both laterally and longitudinally, creates a situation in which the staple pusher is contacted at points offset in two planes so that as the staple pusher is driven, it is controlled and driven substantially perpendicular to the tissue plane of the cartridge without rocking in any direction which would compromise driving the staple perpendicular to the tissue contacting plane. Additionally, each cam wedge includes a first drive face and a second drive face. In one embodiment, the first drive faces form first drive angles with respect to the base and second drive faces form second drive angles with respect to a plane that is substantially parallel to the base. The guide member is adapted for slidably engaging the guide channel for aligning and guiding the actuation sled as it translates through the staple cartridge. In one embodiment, first drive faces are oriented such that first drive angles may be in a range of about 30&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0; while the second drive faces are oriented such that second drive angles may be in a range of about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each staple pusher includes at least one pusher plate and at least one cam member. In one embodiment, each staple pusher includes three pusher plates and two cam members. In an alternate embodiment, each staple pusher includes one pusher plate and two cam members. In a further embodiment, each staple pusher includes two pusher plates and two cam members. First and second cam members are adapted for slidably engaging one of the cam assemblies of the actuation sled. Each cam member includes first and second cam surfaces that define respective first and second engagement or receiving angles that are complementary to the first and second drive angles. In one embodiment, the first receiving angles may be in a range of about 15&#xb0; to about 55&#xb0; while the second receiving angles may be in a range of about 5&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0;. In another embodiment, the first receiving angles may be in a range of about 25&#xb0; to about 45&#xb0; while the second receiving angles may be in a range of about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;. In a further embodiment, the first receiving angle may be in the range of about 30&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0; while the second receiving angle may be in the range of about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0;. The first and second cam members are longitudinally and laterally spaced apart to complement the arrangement of the leading and trailing cam wedges of the actuation sled.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Distal travel of the actuation sled through the staple cartridge causes the sequential engagement of the actuation sled and the staple pushers disposed in the staple cartridge. As the actuation sled moves along the longitudinal axis of the staple cartridge, the first drive faces slidably engage the first cam surfaces thereby urging each staple pusher in a generally vertical direction. As the actuation sled continues to move distally, the second drive faces slidably engage the second cam surfaces of each staple pusher to continue to drive each staple pusher in a generally vertical direction while the first drive faces disengage from the first cam surfaces. Each camming member contacts each staple pusher in at least two longitudinally spaced locations for urging each staple pusher vertically. This longitudinally staggered arrangement of the drive faces in cooperation with the complementary staggered arrangement of the cam members maximizes the longitudinal stability of the staple pusher as it moves vertically. Additionally, the first and second drive angles in cooperation with the complementary first and second receiving angles contribute to the improved longitudinal stability of each staple pusher.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, an actuation sled includes substantially the same or similar components, but the first and second drive angles may be in a range of about 5&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0; while the second drive angles may be in a range of about 20&#xb0; to about 55&#xb0;. In another embodiment, first drive angles may be in a range of about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0; while second drive angles may be in a range of about 25&#xb0; to about 45&#xb0;. In a further embodiment, first drive angles may be in a range of about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0; while second drive angles may be in a range of about 30&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0;. During distal movement of the actuation sled, the first drive faces slidably engage the second cam surfaces urging each staple pusher in a generally vertical direction. As the actuation sled continues to move distally, the second drive faces engage first cam surfaces as the first drive faces disengage from the second cam surfaces. Applicants have found that providing a cam wedges with a first drive surface angle which is less than the second drive angle provides a smooth firing stroke. Similar to the previous embodiment, longitudinal stability of the staple pusher is maximized by the longitudinally staggered (i.e. spaced apart) cam members in cooperation with the complementarily staggered cam wedges. In addition, when the first drive angle is less than the second drive angle, the staple pusher contacts both drive surfaces as contact with the staple pusher transitions from contacting one drive surface to the other drive surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, an actuation sled is disclosed that includes the same or substantially similar components. In this embodiment, the actuation sled includes first and second camming members, a base, and a guide member. Each camming member further includes first and second cam wedges that are longitudinally spaced apart and define a drive angle with respect to the base. The first and second cam wedges of each camming member are laterally spaced apart as well.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment of the present disclosure includes an actuation sled that has the same or substantially similar components. According to this embodiment, the actuation sled includes first and second camming members, a base, and a guide member. Each camming member further includes first and second cam wedges that are laterally spaced apart from each other and define a plurality of drive angles with respect to the base. In particular, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 26&#xb0; to about 36&#xb0;. In another embodiment, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 17&#xb0; to about 23&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 28&#xb0; to about 34&#xb0;. In a further embodiment, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 19&#xb0; to about 21&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 30&#xb0; to about 32&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an alternate embodiment of the present disclosure, an actuation sled is described having the same or substantially similar components. According to this embodiment, the actuation sled includes first and second camming members, a base, and a guide member. Each camming member further includes first and second cam wedges that are laterally and longitudinally spaced apart from each other and define a plurality of drive angles with respect to the base. In particular, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 15&#xb0; to about 55&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 5&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0;. In another embodiment, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 25&#xb0; to about 45&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;. In a further embodiment, each cam wedge defines a first set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 30&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0; and a second set of drive angles that may be in the range of about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the described actuation sleds may be included at a distal end of a cam bar or actuation member in a surgical stapling apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be appreciated from the disclosure, controlled driving of the staple pushers can be maximized by providing cam wedges which are offset both laterally and longitudinally from each other with each drive surface having a first drive angle which is less than the second drive angle.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Embodiments of the presently disclosed staple drive assembly will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. As used herein, the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to that portion of the instrument, or component thereof which is further from the user while the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to that portion of the instrument or component thereof which is closer to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A staple drive assembly <b>100</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Staple drive assembly <b>100</b> includes an actuation sled <b>110</b> and at least one staple pusher <b>160</b>. Actuation sled <b>110</b> includes a base <b>112</b>, a first camming member <b>120</b>, a second camming member <b>140</b>, and a guide member <b>150</b>. First and second camming members <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> include respective first or leading cam wedges <b>122</b>, <b>142</b> and respective second or trailing cam wedges <b>124</b>, <b>144</b>. In one embodiment, staple drive assembly <b>100</b> is adapted for use in a surgical stapler having at least two linear rows of staples such as an endoscopic or laparoscopic stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An example of a surgical stapler having linear rows of staples is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,669,073 to Milliman et al. currently owned and assigned to United States Surgical, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the surgical stapler is shown generally as <b>10</b>. Surgical stapler <b>10</b> includes a trigger assembly <b>30</b>, a body portion <b>12</b>, a staple cartridge <b>40</b>, and an anvil assembly <b>70</b>. Trigger assembly <b>30</b> includes a pivotal trigger <b>32</b>. Pivotal movement of trigger <b>32</b> during an actuation sequence of trigger <b>32</b> translates pivotal movement of trigger <b>32</b> into linear movement of a drive mechanism (not shown). The drive mechanism is operatively coupled to an actuation sled in staple cartridge <b>40</b> to translate linear movement of the drive mechanism to linear movement of the actuation sled. Stapler <b>10</b> is movable such that a portion of body tissue (not shown) may be positioned between anvil assembly <b>70</b> and staple cartridge <b>40</b>. Actuation of stapler <b>10</b> moves anvil assembly <b>70</b> towards staple cartridge <b>40</b> thereby grasping or retaining the portion of body tissue therebetween. In addition, once the portion of body tissue is grasped between anvil assembly <b>70</b> and staple cartridge <b>40</b>, continued actuation of stapler <b>10</b> discharges staples <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through the portion of body tissue and against anvil assembly <b>70</b> to form completed staples <b>50</b>. The presently disclosed staple drive assembly <b>100</b> may be incorporated into staple cartridge <b>40</b> of surgical stapler <b>10</b> disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,669,073. Alternately, staple drive assembly <b>100</b> may be incorporated into other known stapling devices including open-type surgical stapling devices, such as the open surgical staplers shown and described U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,955,959; 4,978,049; 5,395,034; 5,630,541; 5,662,258; 6,131,789 and D278,081 and other endoscopic or laparoscopic surgical stapling devices, such as the endoscopic staplers shown and described in published U.S. Patent Applications 2004/0232195; 2004/0232197 and 2004/0232199. While the present disclosure describes embodiments involving an actuation sled, it also will be appreciated that the design characteristics and function of the sled camming members may be incorporated directly into cam bars or firing wedges, which in turn are connected to the firing mechanism of the surgical stapling instrument.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Interaction between actuation sled <b>110</b> and staple pusher <b>160</b> of staple drive assembly <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref> and discussed in detail hereinafter. Initially, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, actuation sled <b>110</b> translates distally through staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032; in the direction indicated by arrow A (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) causing first drive face <b>122</b><i>a </i>to slidably engage first cam surface <b>162</b><i>a </i>and urge staple pusher <b>160</b> from its first or rest position in a generally vertical direction as indicated by arrow B. Because the lateral and longitudinal offset distances of wedges <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> correspond to the lateral and longitudinal offset distances between cam wedges <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, first drive face <b>124</b><i>a </i>substantially simultaneously slidably engages first cam surface <b>164</b><i>a </i>thereby urging staple pusher <b>160</b> in a generally vertical direction as indicated by arrow B. Since cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a </i>and <b>164</b><i>a </i>are longitudinally offset, staple pusher <b>160</b> is driven in a controlled and balanced manner and any tendency of staple pusher <b>160</b> to tilt or rotate counterclockwise (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-17</figref>) is minimized as staple pusher <b>160</b> is driven through retainer slot <b>60</b>. First drive faces <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>a </i>and respective first cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a </i>have complementary angles that maximize translation of longitudinal motion of actuation sled <b>110</b> to vertical motion of staple pusher <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, continued distal movement of actuation sled <b>110</b> further urges staple pusher <b>160</b> generally vertically to an intermediate position, such that second drive faces <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>slidably engage respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>while first drive faces <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>a </i>substantially simultaneously disengage from respective first cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, second drive faces <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>have complementary angles to maximize translation of longitudinal motion of actuation sled <b>110</b> to vertical motion of staple pusher <b>160</b>. The corresponding lateral and longitudinal offset of second drive faces <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>continue to control the advancement of staple pusher <b>160</b> so as to minimize any tendency of staple pusher <b>160</b> to tilt or rotate in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-17</figref>. Continuing distal movement of actuation sled <b>110</b> continues to urge staple pusher <b>160</b> vertically to its second or end position immediately prior to the disengagement between second drive faces <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Since the interaction between second camming member <b>140</b> and staple pusher <b>160</b> is substantially identical to the intersection of first camming member <b>120</b> and pusher <b>160</b>, the intersection of second camming member <b>140</b> and staple pusher <b>160</b> will not be described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Longitudinal motion of actuation sled <b>110</b> in the direction indicated by arrow A results in first and second camming members <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> slidably engaging staple pushers <b>160</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>. Sliding engagement between leading cam wedges <b>122</b>, <b>142</b> and first cam members <b>162</b> in cooperation with the substantially simultaneous engagement between trailing cam wedges <b>124</b>, <b>144</b> and second cam members <b>164</b> improve the longitudinal stability of the staple pushers <b>160</b> during vertical motion as follows. Leading cam wedges <b>122</b>, <b>142</b> are longitudinally spaced apart from trailing cam wedges <b>124</b>, <b>144</b> by a predetermined amount. Since respective first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are longitudinally spaced apart by a comparable, but complementary amount, longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>110</b> results in the substantially simultaneous, but offset engagement of leading cam wedges <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and trailing cam wedges <b>124</b>, <b>144</b> with respective first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> thereby transferring the longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>110</b> to vertical movement of staple pusher <b>160</b> at longitudinally spaced apart impact points. By transferring longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>110</b> to each staple pusher <b>160</b> at two longitudinally spaced apart impact points, substantially balanced vertical movement of each staple pusher <b>160</b> is achieved. Since there is two point contact between first and second camming members <b>120</b>, <b>140</b> and respective first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> throughout the vertical travel of each staple pusher <b>160</b>, pivoting or tilting of each staple pusher <b>160</b> is minimized due to the two-point contact arrangement. Minimizing pivoting or tilting of each staple pusher <b>160</b> during vertical travel further minimizes pivoting or tilting of each staple <b>50</b> as each staple <b>50</b> is driven vertically in its respective retention slot <b>60</b>. This provides more precise contact of a staple with an anvil pocket (not shown) and thus, improved staple formation.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, the lateral offset between cam wedges <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of first camming member <b>120</b> and cam wedges <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> of second camming member <b>140</b> inhibits &#x201c;rocking&#x201d; of staple pusher <b>160</b>. &#x201c;Rocking&#x201d; of staple pushers may occur when the lifting force applied to the staple pusher by the actuation sled is not balanced creating a tendency for the staple pusher to &#x201c;rock&#x201d; in a direction that is transverse to the movement of the actuation sled. This &#x201c;rocking&#x201d; movement may cause misalignment of the staple during a firing sequence resulting in non-uniform staple formation. In extreme circumstances, &#x201c;rocking&#x201d; may cause a &#x201c;front jump&#x201d; staple formation wherein the rear leg of a staple exits the staple cartridge at an angle and enters the anvil pocket at the same location as the front leg of the same staple. By providing actuation sled <b>110</b> with laterally offset cam wedges, actuation sled <b>110</b> contacts staple pusher <b>160</b> at two laterally spaced contact points substantially simultaneously, thereby imparting a lifting force to staple pusher <b>160</b> that is substantially balanced between first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. Therefore, engagement of actuation sled <b>110</b> with staple pusher <b>160</b> results in substantially even vertical motion of staple pusher <b>160</b> and inhibits &#x201c;rocking&#x201d; of staple pusher <b>160</b> and inhibits front jump staple formation.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further still, as previously discussed, each cam wedge (<b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>) defines a plurality of receiving angles that are complementary to drive angles defined by cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. When the first drive angle is greater than the second drive angle, single point contact between the staple pusher and the cam wedge may occur. Instability of the staple pusher due to such single point contact can also result in tilting or rotation of the staple pusher during firing. Such instability is most likely to occur as the staple pusher transitions from contacting one drive surface to the other drive surface. As described above, unbalanced vertical movement of staple pusher <b>160</b> can cause staple pusher <b>160</b> to travel vertically at an angle such that top surfaces <b>166</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of staple pusher <b>160</b> are not substantially parallel to tissue contacting surface <b>44</b> or backspan <b>52</b> of staple <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This may lead to improperly formed staples, misalignment of the staples with the anvil pockets, or misalignment of the staples with the retention slots. By providing different angles on each cam wedge, an angular differential is defined wherein the angular differential minimized &#x201c;rotation&#x201d; of staple pusher <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Interaction between actuation sled <b>110</b> and staple pushers <b>260</b>, <b>360</b> is substantially similar to the interaction described hereinabove between actuation sled <b>110</b> and staple pusher <b>160</b> and will not be discussed in detail. It is sufficient to note that staple pushers <b>260</b>, <b>360</b> may be freely substituted for staple pusher <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-25</figref>, another embodiment of the presently disclosed staple drive assembly <b>200</b> is illustrated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-25</figref>). Staple drive assembly <b>200</b> includes an actuation sled <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-23</figref>) and at least one staple pusher <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>). Actuation sled <b>210</b> is adapted and configured for use in staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032; as an alternative for actuation sled <b>110</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-23</figref>, actuation sled <b>210</b> includes a first camming member <b>220</b>, a second camming member <b>240</b>, and a guide member <b>250</b>. First and second camming members <b>220</b>, <b>240</b> include respective first or leading cam wedges <b>222</b>, <b>242</b> and respective second or trailing cam wedges <b>224</b>, <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Similar to actuation sled <b>110</b>, leading cam wedges <b>222</b>, <b>242</b> of actuation sled <b>210</b> include first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>242</b><i>a </i>and second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>242</b><i>b</i>. Interposed between first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>242</b><i>a </i>and second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>242</b><i>b </i>are respective first and second transition points <b>223</b>, <b>243</b>. First drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>242</b><i>a </i>extend proximally from a distal point <b>214</b> both longitudinally and vertically thereby forming a first drive angle with respect to base <b>212</b>. Trailing cam wedges <b>224</b>, <b>244</b> are longitudinally spaced apart from leading cam wedges <b>222</b>, <b>242</b> by a predetermined distance. First drive faces <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>a </i>of trailing cam wedges <b>224</b>, <b>244</b> extend both longitudinally and vertically in a proximal direction from respective origin points <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>to form the first drive angle with respect to base <b>212</b>. A plane X&#x2032; extending through transition points <b>223</b>, <b>243</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) of leading cam wedges <b>222</b>, <b>242</b> is parallel to base <b>212</b>. Second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>242</b><i>b </i>form respective second drive angles with respect to plane X&#x2032;. Additionally, plane X&#x2032; extends through transition points <b>225</b>, <b>245</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) of trailing cam wedges <b>224</b>, <b>244</b> and is substantially parallel to base <b>212</b>. Plane X&#x2032; is also substantially parallel to tissue contacting surface <b>44</b> of staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032;. Second drive faces <b>224</b><i>b</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>form respective second drive angles with respect to plane X&#x2032;. In one embodiment, first drive angles may be in a range of about 5&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0; while second drive angles may be in a range of about 20&#xb0; to about 55&#xb0;. In another embodiment, first drive angles may be in a range of about 10&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0; while second drive angles may be in a range of about 25&#xb0; to about 45&#xb0;. In a further embodiment, first drive angles may be in a range of about 15&#xb0; to about 25&#xb0; while the second drive angles may be in a range of about 30&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0;. By providing actuation sled <b>210</b> with first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>242</b><i>a </i>having a flatter initial engaging surface having a lower angle relative to a plane parallel to base <b>212</b>, interaction between actuation sled <b>210</b> and each staple pusher <b>160</b> is more controllable. As actuation sled <b>210</b> translates through staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032; and interacts with each staple pusher as discussed above, actuation sled <b>210</b> gradually and controllably urges each staple pusher <b>160</b> vertically as actuation sled <b>210</b> translates through staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In staple drive assembly <b>200</b>, the interaction between actuation sled <b>210</b> and staple pusher <b>160</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-25</figref> and discussed in detail hereinafter. As actuation sled <b>210</b> moves distally through staple cartridge <b>40</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in a generally horizontal direction as indicated by arrow A, first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a </i>contact respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>and urge staple pusher <b>160</b> in a generally vertical direction as indicated by arrow B from its first or rest position. Since the first drive angle is defined by first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a </i>and is complementary to the second receiving angle defined by second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>, horizontal movement of actuation sled <b>210</b> in direction A causes vertical movement of staple pusher <b>160</b> in direction B.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As actuation sled <b>210</b> continues to move in the direction of arrow A, second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>engage respective first cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a </i>and first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a </i>remain engaged with their respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>, thereby providing additionally longitudinal and vertical stability of staple pusher <b>160</b>. After actuation sled <b>210</b> moves a predetermined distance in the direction of arrow A, first drive faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a </i>disengage from their respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>while second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>remain engaged with their respective first cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a</i>. The second drive angle defined by second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>is complementary to the first receiving angle defined by first cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a </i>further urging staple pusher <b>160</b> in the direction of arrow B through an intermediate position. Continuing distal movement of actuation sled <b>210</b> continues to urge staple pusher <b>160</b> vertically to its second or end position immediately prior to the disengagement between second drive faces <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>and respective second cam surfaces <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>a</i>. A cam wedge having a first drive angle which is less than the second drive angle creates multiple contact points between the cam wedge and the staple pusher as the staple pusher transitions from contacting the first drive surface to contacting the second drive surface, thereby further enhancing the stability of the staple pusher during firing.

Sliding engagement between leading cam wedges <b>522</b>, <b>542</b> and second cam members <b>164</b> in cooperation with the substantially simultaneous engagement between trailing cam wedges <b>524</b>, <b>544</b> and first cam members <b>162</b> improve the longitudinal stability of the staple pushers <b>160</b> during vertical motion as follows. Leading cam wedges <b>522</b>, <b>542</b> are longitudinally spaced apart from trailing cam wedges <b>524</b>, <b>544</b> by a predetermined amount. Since respective first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are longitudinally spaced apart by a comparable, but complementary amount, longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>510</b> results in the substantially simultaneous engagement of leading cam wedges <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> and trailing cam wedges <b>524</b>, <b>544</b> with respective first and second cam members <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> thereby transferring the longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>510</b> to vertical movement of staple pusher <b>160</b> at longitudinally spaced apart impact points. By transferring longitudinal movement of actuation sled <b>510</b> to each staple pusher <b>160</b> at two longitudinally spaced apart impact points, substantially balanced vertical movement of each staple pusher <b>160</b> is achieved.

Minimizing pivoting or tilting of each staple pusher <b>160</b> during vertical travel further minimizes pivoting or tilting of each staple <b>50</b> as each staple <b>50</b> is driven vertically in its respective retention slot <b>60</b>. This provides more precise contact of a staple with an anvil pocket (not shown) and thus, improved staple formation.</p>
