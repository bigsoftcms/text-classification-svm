<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to surgical stapling and cutting instruments adapted for use in the diagnosis and therapy of pathologies treated by stapled resection. More particularly, the invention relates to a lockout mechanism for utilization in conjunction with surgical stapling and cutting instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical stapling and cutting instruments are commonly utilized in the diagnosis and treatment of pathologies treated by stapled resection. Surgical stapling and cutting instruments provide a mechanism to extend the transluminal exploitation of mechanical suturing devices introduced via the anal canal, mouth, stomach and service accesses. Although surgical stapling and cutting instruments are most commonly utilized with rectal pathologies, surgical stapling and cutting instruments may be used in a variety of environments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Over time, surgical stapling and cutting instruments have been developed. These instruments generally include a support frame, an anvil attached to the support frame and a cartridge housing carrying a plurality of staples. The instruments also include a driver within the cartridge housing which pushes all of the staples out simultaneously into the anvil to form the staples into a generally B-shape, suturing tissue together. In addition, these instruments include approximation mechanisms that allow for the cartridge housing and anvil to move relative to each other to accept tissue therebetween. Finally, the instruments include a firing mechanism for moving the driver forward to form the staples against the anvil.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the basic components of the stapling and cutting instruments, these products need a lockout mechanism permitting activation and/or deactivation of the firing means such that the cartridge module may be utilized as a clamp when needed during an emergency. However, the lockout mechanism is designed such that the firing mechanism only works for a cartridge module that has not been previously used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current surgical stapling instruments include a firing bar lockout that is activated by the driver. When a new cartridge module is loaded into the instrument, the location of the driver, as it relates to the cartridge module in the instrument, interferes with the lockout arm in a way so as to let the instrument fire staples. After the instrument fires staples, the location of the driver moves distally in a way that it no longer interferes with the lockout arm. The lockout arm moves to a position that now interferes with the firing bar, but prevents the firing bar from moving distally. However, prior art lockout mechanism include shortcoming which the present invention attempts to overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, prior art devices allow the driver to be pushed back in a manner which could result in turning off the lockout as they tend to be dependent upon the position of the driver in relation to the lockout mechanism. These products, if the driver was pushed back far enough to visually hide the driver in the cartridge, would no longer provide the user a visual indicator of a spent cartridge. In addition, some prior art lockout mechanisms do not provide a strong lockout due to the components interacting in creating the lockout after firing. As such, a need exists for an improved lockout mechanism that provides a clear indication that the lockout mechanism has been activated and overcomes the other shortcomings of prior art lockout mechanisms. The present invention provides such a lockout mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler adapted for applying a plurality of surgical fasteners to body tissue. The surgical stapler includes an anvil structure and a cartridge housing containing a plurality of surgical fasteners. The cartridge housing and anvil structure are relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a second position in close approximation with one another. A firing mechanism is associated with the cartridge housing for ejecting the surgical fasteners from the cartridge housing to be driven against the anvil structure. A lockout mechanism interacts with the cartridge housing for selective activation and deactivation. The lockout mechanism includes a swing gate tab secured to the cartridge housing at a position adjacent a lockout lever, such that firing of the linear surgical stapler rotates the swing gate tab releasing the lockout lever for preventing further firing of the used cartridge housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the lockout lever is spring biased.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the lockout lever is mounted on a support frame of the linear surgical stapler adjacent the cartridge housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the lockout lever sits within a recess formed in the support frame of the linear surgical stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the lockout lever includes a top surface exposed from the recess and a lower surface sitting within the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the top surface includes a tab member shaped and dimensioned for engaging the firing mechanism in a manner preventing firing of the present linear surgical stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the swing gate tab is pivotally secured to the cartridge housing such that it sits above the lockout lever when it is positioned for locking of the lockout lever prior to firing of the linear surgical stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the swing gate tab moves between a first position substantially transverse to a longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler and a second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler, the swing gate tab sits above the lockout lever in its first position holding down the lockout lever in an unlocked positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein prior to firing of the linear surgical stapler the swing gate tab is positioned slightly forward of the lockout lever such that rotation of the swing gate tab causes the swing gate tab to come into contact with the lockout lever.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the swing gate tab moves between a first position substantially transverse to a longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler and a second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler, such that when the swing gate tab is in its first position it sits forward of an upper surface of the lockout lever and during firing of the surgical stapler device the swing gate tab is rotated to its second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the surgical stapler device and removed from the upper surface of the lockout lever permitting the lockout lever to move upwardly into a locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein force from the firing mechanism rotates the swing gate tab with enough force to deflect the lockout lever downwardly into the recess and out of the way of the firing bar and movement of the swing gate tab continues to its second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the surgical stapling device where, and once the firing mechanism is retracted, the lockout lever returns to a blocking position preventing any further rotation of the swing gate and firing of the linear surgical stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler which includes an anvil structure and a cartridge housing containing a plurality of surgical fasteners. The cartridge housing and anvil structure are relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a second position in close approximation with one another. A firing mechanism is associated with the cartridge housing for ejecting the surgical fasteners from the cartridge housing to be driven against the anvil structure. A lockout mechanism interacts with the cartridge housing for selective activation and deactivation. The lockout mechanism includes a swing gate pivotally secured to the cartridge housing such that firing of the linear surgical stapler rotates the swing gate for preventing further firing of the used cartridge housing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein a front facing surface of the swing gate includes a cut out section positioned for engaging a driver of the stapler and preventing further movement thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler including a lock tab which prevents movement of the swing gate after rotation of the swing gate during firing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is another object of the present invention to provide a linear surgical stapler wherein the swing gate is mounted along a side wall of the cartridge housing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when viewed in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which set forth certain embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The detailed embodiment of the present invention is disclosed herein. It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to the various figures, a surgical instrument <b>20</b> adapted for applying a plurality of surgical fasteners to body tissue is disclosed. The surgical instrument <b>20</b> includes an anvil <b>122</b> and a cartridge housing <b>121</b> containing a plurality of surgical fasteners. The cartridge housing <b>121</b> and anvil <b>122</b> are relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a second position in close approximation with one another. A firing mechanism is associated with the cartridge housing <b>121</b> for ejecting the surgical fasteners from the cartridge housing <b>121</b> to be driven against the anvil <b>122</b>. The lockout mechanism <b>180</b> includes a swing gate tab <b>182</b> secured to the cartridge housing <b>120</b> at a position adjacent a lockout lever <b>184</b>, such that firing of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> rotates the swing gate tab <b>182</b> releasing the lockout lever <b>184</b> for preventing further firing of the used cartridge housing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, there is shown a surgical stapling and cutting instrument, in particular, a linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> which is designed to staple and cut tissue. The linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> has a handle <b>21</b> at a first proximal end and an end effector <b>80</b> at an opposite distal end. The end effector <b>80</b> is curved in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Right and left hand structural plates (often called &#x201c;handle plates&#x201d;) <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, respectively, connect the handle <b>21</b> to the end effector <b>80</b> of the instrument (the left hand handle plate is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The handle <b>21</b> has a right hand shroud <b>22</b> coupled to a left hand shroud (the left hand shroud is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The handle <b>21</b> also has a body portion <b>23</b> to grip and maneuver the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 to 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The end effector <b>80</b> is a surgical fastening assembly that includes a cartridge module <b>120</b> and a C-shaped supporting structure <b>81</b>. The term C-shaped is used throughout the specification to describe the concave nature of the supporting structure <b>81</b> and the cartridge module <b>120</b>. The C-shaped construction facilitates enhanced functionality and the use of the term C-shaped in the present specification should be construed to include a variety of concave shapes which would similarly enhance the functionality of surgical stapling and cutting instruments. Although a C-shaped construction is contemplated in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate the supporting structure may take various shapes without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The distal end <b>30</b> of a closure member <b>28</b> is disposed to receive the cartridge module <b>120</b>. The end effector <b>80</b> also includes a safety lockout mechanism <b>180</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 13</figref>) for preventing the firing of a previously fired cartridge module <b>120</b>. The cartridge module <b>120</b> contains a cartridge housing <b>121</b> coupled to an anvil <b>122</b>. The cartridge module <b>120</b> also includes a retaining pin <b>125</b>, a knife <b>126</b>, a removable retainer <b>160</b>, a tissue contacting surface <b>127</b> which displays a plurality of staple-containing slots <b>128</b> in staggered formation in one or more rows (that is, staple lines) on either side of the knife <b>126</b>. Staples (not shown) are fired from the cartridge housing <b>121</b> against staple-forming surface <b>129</b> of the anvil <b>122</b> that faces the tissue-contacting surface <b>127</b> of the cartridge housing <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As will become apparent based upon the following disclosure, the present linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> is designed as a multiple firing device with a replaceable cartridge module <b>120</b>. However, it should be understood that many of the underlying concepts of the present invention may be equally applied in single firing devices without departing from the spirit of the present invention. With this in mind, operation of components other than the lockout mechanism are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent Ser. No. 11/014,910, entitled &#x201c;CURVED CUTTER STAPLER SHAPED FOR MALE PELVIS&#x201d;, filed Dec. 20, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> though <b>13</b> (cut away view into cartridge and support structure), the components of the fired device lockout mechanism <b>180</b> will now be described. The fired device lockout mechanism <b>180</b> in accordance with the present invention employs a swing gate tab <b>182</b> secured to the unused cartridge module <b>120</b> at a positioned adjacent a spring biased lockout lever <b>184</b>. More specifically, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is shaped and dimensioned for positioning above the lockout lever <b>184</b> to prevent upward movement of the lockout lever <b>184</b> to a locking position in which it prevents forward movement of the firing bar <b>43</b>. With this in mind, and prior to firing of the firing bar <b>43</b>, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is positioned directly above the lockout lever <b>184</b> such that it counters the spring bias urging the lockout lever <b>184</b> to a locking position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, the lockout lever <b>184</b> is mounted on the supporting structure <b>81</b> of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>. The lockout lever <b>184</b> sits within a recess <b>196</b> formed in the supporting structure <b>81</b> of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>. The lockout lever <b>184</b> includes a top surface <b>188</b> exposed from the recess <b>196</b> and a lower surface <b>190</b> sitting within the recess <b>196</b>. The top surface <b>188</b> includes a tab member <b>192</b> shaped and dimensioned for engaging the firing bar <b>43</b> in a manner which will be discussed below in greater detail. A spring <b>194</b> is positioned between the lower surface <b>190</b> and the recess <b>196</b>. The spring <b>194</b> functions to urge the lockout lever <b>184</b> upwardly to a locking positioned in line with the firing part the firing bar <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The swing gate tab <b>182</b> is pivotally secured to the cartridge module <b>120</b> such that it sits above lockout lever <b>184</b> when it is positioned for locking of the lockout lever <b>184</b> within the recess <b>196</b> countering the force of the spring <b>194</b>. That is, and as will be described below in greater detail, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> moves between a first position substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> and a second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>. While the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is in its first position, it sits above the upper surface <b>188</b> of the lockout lever <b>184</b> and holds down the lockout lever <b>184</b> in its unlocked positioned. During firing of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is rotated to its second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b> and removed from the upper surface <b>188</b> of the lockout lever <b>184</b> permitting the spring <b>194</b> to force the lockout lever <b>184</b> upwardly into its locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show the lockout mechanism <b>180</b> at the beginning of its cycle. The swing gate tab <b>182</b> is in its first position substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the surgical stapling device <b>20</b>. The swing gate tab <b>182</b> sits directly over the lockout lever <b>184</b> holding the lockout lever <b>184</b> within the recess <b>196</b> such that it does not interfere with firing of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>, and particularly, the firing bar <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the approximation mechanism is activated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, that is, activation of the closure trigger <b>26</b>, the cartridge housing <b>121</b> is advanced to the fully closed position. However, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> remains substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>, holding the lockout lever <b>184</b> within the recess <b>196</b> in its unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, activation of the firing transmission assembly advances the firing bar <b>43</b> through the swing gate tab <b>182</b>. Movement of the firing bar <b>43</b> through swing gate tab <b>182</b> occurs regardless of the position of the driver <b>131</b> or completion of the firing stroke. This movement of the firing bar <b>43</b> through the swing gate tab <b>182</b> moves the swing gate tab <b>182</b> from its first position preventing the spring loaded lockout lever <b>184</b> from moving upward to its second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis for of the linear surgical stapler <b>20</b>. When in its second position, the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is no longer positioned above the upper surface <b>188</b> of the lockout lever <b>184</b> and no longer blocks upward movement of the lockout lever <b>184</b> based upon the urging of the spring <b>194</b> positioned between the lower surface <b>190</b> of the lockout lever <b>184</b> and the recess <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is moved to its second position and the swing gate tab <b>182</b> is no longer holding the lockout lever <b>184</b> in its unlocked position, the firing bar <b>43</b> momentarily sits above the lockout lever <b>184</b> holding it within the recess <b>196</b>. As the firing transmission assembly, in particular, the firing bar <b>43</b>, is retracted, the lockout lever <b>184</b> is no longer held within the recess <b>196</b> by either the swing gate tab <b>182</b> or the firing bar <b>43</b>, and the lockout lever <b>184</b> moves into a locked position under the force of the spring <b>194</b>. While in this position, the lockout lever <b>184</b> will block any further attempts to activate the firing means (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>). Although the lockout lever <b>184</b> blocks rearward movement of the driver <b>131</b>, the firing bar <b>43</b> is ultimately retracted to its proximal position. After the lockout lever <b>184</b> is released into its up position when the firing bar <b>43</b> moves to its distal position, there is a sloped surface <b>185</b> on the distal face of the lockout lever <b>184</b> which acts as a cam that allows the firing bar <b>43</b> to push it &#x201c;down&#x201d; out of the way during the reward retraction of the firing bar <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, although a linear lockout lever is disclosed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lockout lever <b>184</b> could also be a rotating lockout lever <b>184</b>&#x2032; that is mounted at one end <b>184</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; for pivotal rotation about the mount such that the spring biased <b>194</b>&#x2032; upward rotating lockout lever <b>184</b>&#x2032; still functions the same way as described with reference to the preferred embodiment disclosed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, the swing gate tab does not constantly sit above the lockout lever prior to firing as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 13</figref>. The present fired device lockout mechanism <b>280</b> employs a swing gate <b>282</b> pivotally secured to the unused cartridge module <b>220</b>. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the cartridge module <b>220</b> includes a cartridge housing <b>223</b> and the swing gate <b>282</b> is secured to a side wall <b>221</b> of the cartridge module <b>220</b>. With this in mind, and as will be appreciated based upon the following disclosure, side wall <b>221</b> of the cartridge module <b>220</b> is provided with a recess <b>222</b> shaped and dimensioned to receive the swing gate <b>282</b> as it rotates toward the side wall <b>221</b> allowing the firing bar <b>243</b> to pass thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The swing gate <b>282</b> is shaped and dimensioned for rotation to block further movement of the fired driver <b>231</b> and consequently prevent use of the previously fired cartridge module <b>220</b>. With this in mind, the swing gate includes a front facing surface <b>288</b> having a cut out section <b>286</b> adjacent its distal end and an angled surface <b>289</b> adjacent its proximal end. A flat surface <b>291</b> is positioned between the cut out section <b>286</b> and the angled surface <b>289</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The pre-firing configuration of the present lockout mechanism <b>280</b> is shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The cartridge module <b>220</b> is loaded with the swing gate <b>282</b> in its first position as shown. The swing gate lock <b>282</b> is maintained in its first position until the firing bar <b>243</b> moves forward and rotates the swing gate <b>282</b> to its second position, or &#x201c;spent cartridge&#x201d; position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>). The lock tab <b>284</b> sits directly behind the swing gate tab <b>282</b> and assists in keeping the swing gate <b>282</b> in its first position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon firing of the firing transmission assembly, the firing bat <b>243</b> is forcefully moved forward engaging the swing gate <b>282</b>, particularly, the flat surface <b>291</b> of the swing gate <b>282</b>. The force of the firing bat <b>243</b> rotates the swing gate <b>282</b> with enough force to deflect the lock tab <b>284</b>, allowing the swing gate <b>282</b> to be held within the recess <b>222</b> formed in the side wall <b>221</b> of the cartridge housing <b>223</b> between the lock tab <b>284</b> and the wall of the cartridge module <b>220</b>. Movement of the lock tab <b>284</b> is further facilitated by the provision of a beveled surface <b>285</b> over which the swing gate <b>282</b> moves during rotation thereof and movement of the firing bar <b>243</b> relative to the swing gate is further facilitated by the angled surface <b>289</b> of the swing gate <b>282</b> over which the firing bar <b>243</b> slides as it rotates the swing gate <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At this position, the swing gate <b>282</b> is in its second position substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear surgical stapler. While in this second position, the cut out section <b>286</b> along the front facing surface <b>288</b> of the swing gate <b>282</b> is positioned for preventing rearward movement of the driver <b>231</b>, and consequently prevents further use of the cartridge module <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The lockout mechanisms in accordance with the present invention overcome shortcoming of the prior art by providing a variety of advantages. In particular, the present invention prevents the driver from being pushed back in a manner turning off lockout. In addition, the present lockout mechanism is better than other lockout mechanisms as it works between the anvil structure, which is typically built for high loads, and firing bar directly to produce a stronger lockout. In addition, the driver is exposed above the cartridge deck after firing, providing a visual indicator of a spent cartridge. This provides for the possibility of adapting the lockout swing gate to lock the driver into position and prevent the user from inadvertently turning off this visual safety feature.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<claim-text>14. A linear surgical stapler adapted for applying a plurality of surgical fasteners to body tissue, the surgical stapler comprising:
<claim-text>an anvil structure;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a cartridge housing containing a plurality of surgical fasteners, the cartridge housing and anvil structure being relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a second position in close approximation with one another;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a firing mechanism associated with the cartridge housing for ejecting the surgical fasteners from the cartridge housing to be driven against the anvil structure; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a lockout mechanism interacting with the cartridge housing for selective activation and deactivation of the linear surgical stapler by blocking the firing mechanism;</claim-text>
<claim-text>the lockout mechanism includes a lockout lever mounted to a supporting structure of the linear surgical stapler in which the cartridge housing is positioned, the lockout lever cooperating with a swing gate pivotally secured to the cartridge housing wherein the swing gate selectively prevents movement of the lockout lever when the swing gate is in a first position such that firing of the linear surgical stapler by actuation of the firing mechanism rotates the swing gate from the first position releasing the lockout lever for preventing further firing by actuation of the firing mechanism of the cartridge housing after use by blocking further activation of the firing mechanism; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>the cartridge module further including a lock tab which prevents movement of the swing gate after rotation of the swing gate during firing.</claim-text>

<claim-text>15. A linear surgical stapler adapted for applying a plurality of surgical fasteners to body tissue, the surgical stapler comprising:
<claim-text>an anvil structure;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a cartridge housing containing a plurality of surgical fasteners, the cartridge housing and anvil structure being relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a second position in close approximation with one another;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a firing mechanism associated with the cartridge housing for ejecting the surgical fasteners from the cartridge housing to be driven against the anvil structure, the firing mechanism including a firing bar movable between a first position and a retracted position; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a lockout mechanism interacting with the cartridge housing for selective activation and deactivation of the linear surgical stapler by blocking the firing mechanism;</claim-text>
<claim-text>the lockout mechanism includes a swing gate tab pivotally secured to the cartridge housing at a position preventing movement of a lockout lever wherein the swing gate tab moves between a first position in which it prevents movement of the lockout lever and a second position in which the lockout lever is released for movement, such that firing of the linear surgical stapler by actuation of the firing mechanism rotates the swing gate tab releasing the lockout lever for preventing further firing of the cartridge housing after use, force from the firing mechanism rotates the swing gate tab with enough force such that the firing bar deflects the lockout lever downwardly into a recess and out of a way of the firing bar and movement of the swing gate tab continues to a second position of the swing gate substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the surgical stapling device where, and once the firing bar is moved to the retracted position, the lockout lever returns to a blocking position preventing any further rotation of the swing gate and firing of the linear surgical stapler. </claim-text>
