<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to vacuum cleaners, and more particularly, to a vacuum cleaner having an improved dust collector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the vacuum cleaner draws dust-laden air from a floor of a room, removes the dust from the air, and discharges only the air again.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a related art vacuum cleaner. As shown, the vacuum cleaner is provided with a body <b>1</b>, and a suction nozzle <b>2</b>. The body <b>1</b> has a suction means mounted therein for drawing room air. Air is drawn from the floor to the body <b>1</b> through the suction nozzle <b>2</b> by a suction force generated at the body <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The body <b>1</b> has a lower body <b>5</b> and an upper body <b>6</b>. The lower body <b>5</b> has the suction means mounted therein, and the upper body <b>6</b> has electric components mounted therein for controlling the vacuum cleaner. The body <b>1</b> has wheels <b>8</b> secured to opposite sides of a lower portion thereof, and the wheel <b>8</b> has an outlet <b>8</b><i>a </i>for discharging air having foreign matters removed from the air drawn through the suction nozzle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Between the body <b>1</b> and the suction nozzle <b>2</b>, there are a suction hose <b>3</b><i>b</i>, an operation part <b>4</b>, and an extension tube <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The suction hose <b>3</b><i>b </i>is formed of a flexible material, and the operation part <b>4</b> is at an end of the suction hose <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The extension tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>makes the suction hose <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the suction nozzle <b>2</b> in communication.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Upon application of power through a power line <b>9</b>, the vacuum cleaner is at a standby condition. If a user operates the operation part <b>4</b>, an appropriate suction force is generated at the suction means in the body <b>1</b>. The suction force is transmitted to the suction nozzle <b>2</b> through the suction hose <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the operation part <b>4</b>, and the extension tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>in succession.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to this, dust-laden air is drawn through the suction nozzle <b>2</b>. The dust is separated from the air at a dust collecting box <b>10</b>, to discharge only the air through the outlet <b>8</b><i>a</i>. By repeating this process, cleaning of the floor is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the related art vacuum cleaner has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">First, the related art vacuum cleaner has a structure of the dust collecting box difficult to clean, to require much time, or to have inconvenience in cleaning the dust collecting box after finish of the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Second, dismounting of the filter from an inside of the vacuum cleaner is not easy, to cause difficulty in replacement and cleaning of the filter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a vacuum cleaner that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum cleaner having a dust collector assembly which is easy to replace and clean.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a vacuum cleaner includes suction means for providing suction force, a suction nozzle for drawing room air by the suction force provided from the suction means, a dust collecting box for receiving the room air drawn through the suction nozzle, an upper cover having an opening at a central portion thereof for selective opening/closing of an upper portion of the dust collecting box, and a filter assembly selectively fastened to an edge of the opening, for filtering dust from the drawn air, and discharging the air to upward.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The filter assembly includes an upper holding part loaded on an upper surface of an edge of the opening, the upper holding part having an air discharge hole at a central portion thereof, a lower holding part spaced a distance downward from the upper holding part, and a filter between the upper holding part and the lower holding part, the filter having a discharge passage therein. The edge of the opening includes a step for loading the upper holding part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The vacuum cleaner further includes a projection piece projected from one side of the upper holding part in a radial direction, and a lever at one side of an upper surface of the upper cover for fastening the projection piece selectively as the lever rotates around a hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The upper cover includes a loading portion at one side recessed downwardly, for accommodating the projection piece and the lever. The upper holding part includes hand grips projected upward from the upper surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The upper holding part has a diameter greater than a diameter of the lower holding part. The dust collecting box includes a separation plate for dividing an inside space of the dust collecting box into an upper space and a lower space. The separation plate includes a hole at one side for separating dusts with relatively large masses downward. The separation plate has an outside diameter smaller than an inside diameter of the dust collecting box.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the vacuum cleaners, there are canister type and upright type of vacuum cleaners. The canister type of vacuum cleaner has a suction nozzle and a body provided separately and connected with a connection tube. Opposite to this, the upright type of vacuum cleaner has the suction nozzle and the body provided as one unit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The following embodiments are applicable all types of vacuum cleaners including the canister type and the upright type of vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a disassembled perspective view of a dust collector assembly in a vacuum cleaner in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are sections of the dust collector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the dust collector assembly <b>100</b> includes a dust collecting box <b>110</b>, an upper cover <b>140</b>, and a filter assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The body of the vacuum cleaner has suction means mounted therein for providing a suction force, and room air is drawn into the dust collector assembly <b>100</b> through the suction nozzle by the suction force.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dust collecting box <b>110</b> is cylindrical substantially, and has a suction guide <b>112</b> at a side thereof for guiding the air drawn thereto. The suction guide <b>112</b> has one end projected obliquely from an outside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, for drawing air through the suction guide <b>112</b> in a tangential direction along an inside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For easy mounting/dismounting to/from the body, the dust collecting box <b>110</b> has a hand grip <b>130</b> at an outside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The dust collecting box <b>110</b> has an upper cover <b>140</b> provided to an upper part thereof for covering the upper part of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. The upper cover <b>140</b> has an opening <b>142</b> at a central portion thereof, for securing the filter assembly <b>150</b> therein, selectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The filter assembly <b>150</b> has an upper holding part <b>156</b>, a lower holding part <b>154</b>, and a filter <b>152</b>. The upper holding part <b>156</b> is a circular plate with an air discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a </i>at a central portion thereof, fitted to an upper surface of an edge of the opening <b>142</b>. For this, the edge of the opening <b>142</b> has a step for fitting to the upper holding part <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lower holding part <b>154</b> is spaced a distance from the upper holding part <b>156</b> downwardly. The cylindrical filter <b>152</b> is provided between the upper holding part <b>156</b> and the lower holding part <b>154</b>. The filter <b>152</b> has an air discharge passage <b>152</b><i>a </i>therein.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The upper holding part <b>156</b> has a diameter relatively greater than the lower holding part <b>154</b>. Accordingly, the lower holding part <b>154</b> and the filter <b>152</b> can be inserted through the opening <b>142</b>, more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The air discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a </i>at a central portion of the upper holding part <b>156</b> discharges the air guided through the air discharge passage <b>152</b><i>a</i>. The air discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a </i>has a discharge guide <b>156</b><i>b </i>projected upward from a circumference thereof, so that the discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a </i>can be connected to the outlet in the body of the vacuum cleaner, easily.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The upper holding part <b>156</b> has a hand grip <b>158</b> on an upper surface for easy drawing of the filter assembly <b>150</b> from the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. As shown, one pair of hand grips <b>158</b> are formed on opposite sides of the discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the meantime, the upper cover <b>140</b> has a loading portion <b>146</b> at one side recessed downwardly. The loading part <b>146</b> has fastening means for fastening the filter assembly <b>150</b> to the upper cover <b>140</b>, selectively.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the fastening means includes a projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032; and a lever <b>148</b>. The projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032; is projected from one side of the upper holding part <b>156</b> in a radial direction. The lever <b>148</b> fastens the projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032; selectively as the lever <b>148</b> rotates around the hinge <b>148</b>&#x2032; mounted on an upper surface of the upper cover <b>140</b>. Accordingly, as the projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032; is fastened by the lever <b>148</b>, separation of the filter assembly <b>150</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The operation of the lever <b>148</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After rotating the lever <b>148</b> to release the projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032;, if the hand grip <b>158</b> is pulled upward, the filter assembly <b>150</b> is separated from the opening <b>142</b> of the upper cover <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Opposite to this, at the time of securing the filter assembly <b>150</b>, the filter assembly <b>150</b> is inserted in the opening <b>142</b>, and the lever <b>148</b> is rotated, when the projection piece <b>156</b>&#x2032; is fastened by the lever <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the meantime, for filtering dust from air, the filter <b>152</b> is provided between the holding parts <b>154</b>, and <b>156</b>. The filter <b>152</b> is formed of an endurable and washable fibrous plastic. It is preferable that the filter <b>152</b> is formed of polyester. Moreover, by forming a plurality of folds in a length direction of the filter <b>152</b>, a contact area with air is increased to improve a dust collecting capability.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A mesh filter may further be provided to an outside of the filter <b>152</b>, or a plurality of filters may be provided in multiple layers.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The discharge passage <b>152</b><i>a </i>is inside of the filter <b>152</b>, such that the air passed through the filter <b>152</b> flows upward along the discharge passage <b>152</b><i>a </i>until the air is discharged through the discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For maintaining the cylindrical filter <b>152</b> between the holding parts <b>154</b> and <b>156</b>, it is preferable that means for connecting the upper and lower holding parts <b>154</b>, and <b>156</b>, and supporting the filter <b>152</b> is required. The supporting means may be a plurality of ribs connected between the holding parts or a cylindrical member having a plurality of holes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For dividing an inside space of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> in an upper and a lower spaces, a separation plate <b>120</b> is provided to an inside of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, and a hole <b>120</b><i>a </i>is formed in one side of the separation plate <b>120</b>. Dust particles with relatively large masses in the air drop down below the separation plate <b>120</b> through the hole <b>120</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The lower holding part <b>154</b> is in contact with an upper surface of the separation plate <b>120</b>. Therefore, since the lower holding part <b>154</b> is supported on the separation plate <b>120</b>, the lower holding part <b>154</b> is held, more securely.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <b>5</b> illustrate a diagram of a filter holding part applied to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the filter holding part provided under the filter assembly includes a base and a plurality of extensions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The base has a loading recess for seating an underside of the lower holding part. The extensions, extended in a radial direction from a side of the base, are fixed to an inside surface of the dust collecting box.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the meantime, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2&#x2dc;4</figref>, the dust collecting box <b>110</b> has a liquid sprayer <b>160</b> at one side of an inside thereof. The liquid sprayer <b>160</b> includes a body <b>162</b>, a spray button <b>164</b>, and a spray nozzle <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Liquid is stored in the cylindrical body <b>162</b>. The spray nozzle <b>166</b> is on an upper portion of the body <b>162</b>, and a spray button <b>164</b> is provided to a top of the body <b>162</b>. Upon pushing the spray button <b>164</b>, the liquid is sprayed through the spray nozzle <b>166</b>. The sprayed liquid increases humidity of an inside of the dust collecting box, to prevent static electricity. The liquid has insecticide, germicide, aromatic agent, or the like added thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The upper cover <b>140</b> of the dust collecting box has a press button <b>144</b> in the vicinity of an edge thereof in contact with the spray button <b>164</b>. Therefore, upon pressing the press button <b>144</b>, the spray button is pressed simultaneously, and the liquid is sprayed through the spray nozzle <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The liquid sprayer <b>160</b> is mounted on a mounting part <b>170</b> on an inside of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. The mounting part <b>170</b> includes an attachment portion <b>172</b>, a supporting plate <b>174</b>, and elastic arms <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The attachment portion <b>172</b> is attached to the inside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, and the supporting plate <b>174</b> is on an underside of the attachment portion <b>172</b> for supporting an underside of the liquid sprayer <b>160</b>. The elastic arms <b>176</b> are respectively extended forward from opposite sides of a substantially middle portion of the attachment part <b>172</b>, and have elasticity. The elastic arms <b>176</b> are curved to surround the body <b>162</b>, for receiving and holding the body <b>162</b> by an elastic deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">That is, upon pushing in the liquid sprayer <b>160</b>, the elastic arms <b>176</b> move away from each other, to receive and hold the liquid sprayer <b>160</b> on an inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The operation of the dust collector assembly in the vacuum cleaner in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The dust-laden air drawn through the suction nozzle is introduced into an inside of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> through the suction guide <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this instance, dust particles with relatively large masses drop down below the separation plate <b>120</b>, and dust particles with relatively small masses are separated by the filter during the dust particles flow together with air, and accumulated on an inside of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. The air passed through the filter <b>152</b> is discharged through the discharge hole <b>156</b><i>a </i>via the discharge passage <b>152</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this instance, upon pressing the press button <b>144</b> on the upper cover <b>140</b> of the dust collecting box, the spray button <b>164</b> on the liquid sprayer <b>160</b> is pressed, to spray the liquid toward an inner portion of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> through the spray nozzle <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6&#x2dc;8</figref> illustrate a dust collector assembly in accordance with other preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, an upper portion of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> is opened, and the upper portion is opened/closed with an upper cover <b>140</b>. The upper cover <b>140</b> has an opening in a central portion thereof, for selective securing of the filter assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">There is a separation plate <b>220</b> fixed to an upper portion of a lower portion of the dust collecting box for dividing an inside space of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> into an upper space, and a lower space. That is, there is a supporting member <b>122</b> projected upward from a bottom of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, and the separation plate <b>220</b> is provided to a top of the supporting member <b>122</b>. It is preferable that the separation plate <b>220</b> and the bottom of the dust collecting box <b>110</b> are formed as one unit.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The separation plate <b>220</b> has an outside diameter smaller than an inside diameter of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, to form a gap <b>220</b><i>a </i>between the separation plate <b>220</b> and an inside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. Dust particles with comparatively large masses drop down below the separation plate <b>220</b> through the gap <b>220</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the meantime, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the separation plate <b>220</b> includes a first plate <b>220</b>&#x2032; and a second plate <b>220</b>&#x2033;, and the supporting member <b>122</b> has a hinge shaft <b>220</b><i>h </i>at a top thereof. The first plate <b>220</b>&#x2032; and the second plate <b>220</b>&#x2033; are semicircular, and rotatable around the high shaft <b>220</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the plates <b>220</b>&#x2032; and <b>220</b>&#x2033; are rotated upward, most of the upper and lower spaces of the separation plate <b>220</b> are in communication with each other. Once the plates <b>220</b>&#x2032; and <b>220</b>&#x2033; are rotated upward, the user can clean the dust under the separation plate <b>220</b>, easily.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> or <b>10</b> illustrates a diagram of a dust collector assembly in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the dust collecting box <b>110</b> has opened upper, and lower portions, and the opened lower portion is opened/closed with a lower cover <b>180</b>, selectively. The lower cover <b>180</b> rotates around a cover hinge <b>182</b> provided to a lower portion of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. There is a locking assembly <b>190</b> opposite to cover hinge <b>182</b> for selective fastening of the lower cover <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The locking assembly <b>190</b> includes a projection <b>192</b>, a hinge shaft <b>198</b>, a rotatable hook <b>194</b>, and a spring &#x2018;S&#x2019;. The projection <b>192</b> is projected from the lower cover <b>180</b>, and the hinge shaft <b>198</b> is projected from a holding part <b>196</b> provided to an outside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. The rotatable hook <b>194</b> makes seesaw movement around the hinge shaft <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The rotatable hook <b>194</b> includes a hook portion <b>194</b>&#x2033; for hooking the projection <b>192</b> selectively, and a button portion <b>194</b>&#x2032;. The spring &#x2018;S&#x2019; is between the button portion <b>194</b>&#x2032; and the outside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>. When the button portion <b>194</b>&#x2032; is pressed, the hook portion <b>194</b>&#x2033; rotates in a counter clockwise direction, and the projection <b>192</b> is released from an engaged state. Opposite to this, if no force is applied to the button portion <b>194</b>&#x2032;, the button portion <b>194</b>&#x2032; rotates in a clockwise direction by the spring &#x2018;S&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the meantime, the projection may be formed on the outside surface of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, while the rotatable hook <b>192</b> is formed on the lower cover <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the meantime, a partition wall <b>185</b> is provided between the lower cover <b>180</b> and the separation plate <b>120</b>, for prevention of circulation of air.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12&#x2dc;14</figref>, the filter assembly <b>150</b> is fixed to an under side of the upper cover <b>140</b>, selectively. The filter assembly includes an upper holding part <b>156</b>, a lower holding part <b>154</b>, and a filter <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The upper holding part <b>156</b> has an air discharge hole <b>152</b><i>a </i>at a central portion thereof, and recesses <b>156</b>&#x2032; at regular intervals in a circumferential direction. There is a lip <b>258</b> under one of the recesses <b>156</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the meantime, the upper cover <b>140</b> has a filter mounting assembly on an underside of an inner edge of the opening <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the filter mounting assembly includes a mounting portion <b>260</b>, a moving member <b>270</b>, align means <b>276</b>, and a spring &#x2018;S&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The mounting portion <b>260</b> is circular along an inner edge of the opening <b>142</b>, and extended downwardly. There are holding pieces <b>262</b> each projected in a radial direction inwardly from each end of the extensions. It is preferable that the mounting portion <b>260</b> is formed as one unit with the upper cover <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Upon inserting the holding pieces <b>262</b> between the recesses in the upper holding part <b>156</b>, and rotating the filter assembly <b>150</b>, the holding pieces <b>262</b> engage with an outside circumferential surface of the upper holding part <b>156</b>. According to this, the filter assembly <b>150</b> is fastened to the underside of the upper cover <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the meantime, the moving member <b>270</b> is provided to an outside of the mounting portion <b>260</b>, and is brought into contact with the lip <b>258</b>, selectively. The mounting portion has one opened side through which the lip <b>258</b> is brought into contact with the moving member <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The align means <b>276</b> is projected from a side of the moving member <b>270</b> to an outside of the upper cover <b>140</b>. The upper cover <b>140</b> has a U-cut <b>140</b>&#x2032; in one side surface thereof for pass of the align means <b>276</b>, and there is a spring &#x2018;S&#x2019; between the align means <b>276</b> and an outside circumferential surface of the mounting portion <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>, the moving member <b>270</b> has an operation recess <b>272</b> for receiving the lip <b>258</b> therein. The operation recess <b>272</b> has a stopper <b>274</b> at one side thereof for stopping rotation of the lip <b>258</b>. When the upper holding part <b>156</b> of the filter assembly <b>150</b> is inserted in, and fastened to the mounting portion <b>260</b>, the lip <b>258</b> is inserted in the operation recess <b>272</b>. In this instance, the align means <b>276</b> is projected outward by a restoring force of the spring &#x2018;S&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Then, as the filter assembly <b>150</b> rotates in a clockwise direction, the lip <b>258</b> moves to a right side of the stopper <b>274</b> until the lip <b>258</b> is brought into contact with the moving member <b>270</b>, when the lip <b>258</b> pushes the moving member <b>270</b> backward.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The align means <b>276</b> is provided to a part opposite to a part the moving member <b>270</b> and the lip <b>258</b> are brought into contact. Therefore, if the moving member <b>270</b> is pushed backward, the align means moves back to an inside of the U-cut <b>140</b>&#x2032;. The moving back of the align means <b>276</b> indicates that the filter assembly <b>150</b> is fastened to the upper cover, accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Opposite to this, when it is intended to separate the filter assembly <b>150</b> from the upper cover <b>140</b>, in a state the moved back align means is pushed backward further, the filter assembly <b>150</b> is rotated in a counter clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In this instance, the lip <b>258</b> moves toward the operation recess <b>272</b>, and the align means <b>276</b> is projected to the outside of the upper cover <b>140</b>, again. Also, the holding pieces <b>262</b> disengage through the recesses <b>156</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As described before, the user can determine if the filter assembly <b>150</b> is fastened accurately depending on an extent of projection of the align means <b>276</b>. If the filter assembly <b>150</b> is not fastened to the cover <b>140</b> accurately, the align means <b>276</b> interferes with a top of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>, to fail the accurate fastening of the upper cover <b>140</b> with the top of the dust collecting box <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the meantime, after the upper cover is mounted on the dust collecting box, as one end of the knob <b>78</b> is inserted in the slot <b>78</b>&#x2032;, the dust collector assembly <b>150</b> is fastened to the cavity portion <b>72</b> of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a section showing a separation plate mounted on the dust collector assembly, for dividing an inside of the dust collecting box into an upper portion and a lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the separation plate <b>180</b> is in contact with an under side of the filter assembly <b>150</b>, and the separation plate <b>180</b> has a hole <b>180</b>&#x2032; in one side thereof for falling down of dust particles with comparatively large masses.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As has been described, the dust collector assembly in a vacuum cleaner of the present invention has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">First, the detachable provision of the filter assembly to an upper surface of the dust collecting box permits separation of only the filter assembly in an upper direction as required. Therefore, the user can clean the dust collector assembly more easily, and replacement of the filter assembly is easy.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Second, by pressing a press button, to spray liquid from a liquid sprayer as required, humidity of the vicinity of the filter assembly can be increased, and generation of static electricity at an inside of the duct collecting container can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Third, the upper surface of the dust collecting box can be opened/closed with the upper cover, selectively. Dust can be cleaned from an inside of the dust collecting box easily after the upper cover is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Fourth, as the air discharge hole of the dust collecting box is formed in an upper portion thereof, so that the dust drops down by gravity, and the cleaned air is discharged upward, more effective cleaning can be made.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Fifth, in a case the filter assembly is not fastened to the upper cover, the dust collector assembly is not received at the cavity portion of the vacuum cleaner. Therefore, defective assembly of the filter assembly can be prevented in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
