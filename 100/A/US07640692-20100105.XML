<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to the drawings, the invention will now be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The trolling system <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, is mounted adjacent the stern of boat <b>12</b>. The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2</figref> comprises at least a pair of mounting members or disks <b>14</b> secured in spaced positions across desk <b>16</b>, which extends across the stern of the boat.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A pair of mounting rods <b>18</b>, each having threaded ends, are secured at one end in the threaded bores of disks <b>14</b> and extend vertically from disk <b>14</b> and deck <b>16</b>. Locking bolts <b>15</b> may be provided to lock mounting rods <b>18</b> in engagement with disk <b>14</b>. It is noted that in the event that the boat decking includes hand rails, it may be desirable to substitute saddle clamps <b>20</b> for disks <b>14</b> and secure rods <b>18</b> with the opposed hand rails.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Locking members in the form of brackets or saddle clamps <b>20</b> are secured with the upper ends of mounting rods <b>18</b> by way of a threaded bore to be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Trolling bar <b>19</b> may be in the form of a tube or a bar or it may be comprised of a pair of bars secured together at opposed ends by bracket or saddle clamp <b>26</b>. Four bolts <b>28</b> secure upper and lower sections of clamp <b>26</b> with the opposed ends of the pair of rods forming trolling bar <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Trolling bar <b>19</b>, when in its preferred operative position, is mounted to extend across boat <b>12</b> adjacent its stern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. A plurality of brackets or saddle clamps <b>20</b> are positioned in spaced positions along the trolling bar. The clamps each include an upper section <b>21</b> and a lower section <b>23</b> with each section having a shaped groove <b>22</b>. Each section <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> also includes bore <b>24</b>. Fishing rod holders <b>36</b>, which are commercially available, include stem <b>32</b> with a threaded lower end. Rod holders <b>36</b> are engaged with selected of clamps <b>20</b> by way of stem <b>32</b> securing with bore <b>24</b>. Normally, wing or locking nuts <b>35</b> lock the fishing rod holders in position. It is noted that by providing wing nuts as securing members for upper and lower sections <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, clamps <b>20</b> may be easily adjusted radially about bar <b>19</b> for adjusting the angular position of the rod holders.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Clamps <b>20</b> are also utilized to connect bar <b>19</b> with rods <b>28</b>. The shaped grooves <b>22</b>, formed in clamps <b>20</b> are sized to mate with the circumference of trolling bar <b>19</b>. Lower sections <b>23</b> also include bores similar to bores <b>24</b> of upper section <b>21</b> which are also sized to mate with the threaded upper ends of mounting rods <b>18</b>. Bores <b>24</b> of section <b>21</b> are sized to receive locking screw <b>30</b> which engages with and secures trolling bar <b>19</b> against rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is noted that in certain situations it may be desirable to a single mounting rod <b>18</b> mounted centrally of trolling bar <b>18</b>. In this arrangement, rod holders <b>36</b> would be mounted on either side of mounting rod <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is noted that stainless steel is preferred for forming all members of the structure. Other materials such as aluminum, brass, copper and molded plastics may be suitable and can be substituted as desired. The trolling bar is preferably 16 gauge&#xd7;1&#x2033; diameter stainless steel and up to 8&#x2032; in length. The mounting rods are preferably &#xbd;&#x2033; stainless steel and are between 10&#x2033; and 30&#x2033; in length.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a second arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the base members are identical. Mounting disk <b>14</b> is secured with deck <b>16</b> and includes a threaded bore <b>11</b>. Mounting rod <b>18</b> is secured in bore <b>11</b> and extends perpendicularly from deck <b>16</b> as earlier described. Support tube <b>46</b> is positioned over mounting rod <b>18</b> with its lower end resting on mounting disk <b>14</b>. Spacers <b>42</b> are positioned along rod <b>18</b> and act to maintain support tube <b>46</b> evenly spaced from the rod. The upper end of support tube <b>46</b> comprises an arcuate shaped portion <b>38</b> which is designed to mate with a portion of the circumference of trolling bar <b>19</b>. In position, contoured portion <b>38</b> is located below the upper end of mounting rod <b>18</b> a distance slightly greater than the diameter of the rod. A pair of bores or holes <b>40</b> are formed in trolling bar <b>19</b>, in spaced positions equal the spacing of mounting rods <b>18</b>. In position, the upper end of each mounting rod <b>18</b> extends through a bore <b>40</b> allowing the trolling bar to rest in shaped portions <b>38</b> and be vertically supported by support tube <b>46</b>. A locking member in the form of a nut washer arrangement <b>44</b> secures the trolling bar in position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The trolling bar, when secured in position, is ready to receive a plurality of brackets <b>20</b> which, in turn, each mount a fishing rod holder <b>36</b> as earlier described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Again, in certain instances only one mounting rod <b>18</b> and support tube <b>46</b> may be desired to mount the trolling bar <b>19</b> as earlier set forth.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, another arrangement of the trolling system is shown. In system <b>10</b><sup>1</sup>, a pair of trolling bars <b>19</b> are connected at opposing ends with an elongated support plate <b>47</b>. Support plates <b>47</b> include a plurality of bores <b>40</b> which receive the upper ends of mounting rods <b>18</b> in spaced positions. The mounting rods <b>18</b> are encased with tubes <b>46</b>, the upper ends of which support the elongated plates <b>47</b>. Locking members <b>44</b>, either bolts or wing nuts, secure elongated plates in position. This is substantially the mounting arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lower ends of rods <b>18</b> are secured in threaded bores <b>40</b> formed in elongated mounting plate or elongated mounting member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Mounting plates <b>48</b> are arranged across trolling bars <b>19</b> and are secured in position using bolts <b>28</b> and a section of bracket <b>20</b> such as lower section <b>23</b>. Rod holders <b>36</b> are engaged in bores <b>40</b> as earlier described. This arrangement provides greater stability.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Fishing rods are mounted in the fishing rod holders to extend rearwardly and generally parallel with the longitudinal axis of the boat.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is noted that in both arrangements, only one mounting rod and associated members may be employed to locate the trolling bar or bars or the system may require the use of two or more mounting rods and associated members. The length of the trolling bar or bars is the determining factor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.</p>
