<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pre-assembled anti-creep waist-clothing stay device including a patch having front and back surfaces and sized for application to a crotch-adjacent inner-seam area of the waist-clothing and a stay strip affixed to the back surface of the patch, the stay strip being positioned and sized such that the patch extends beyond edges of the stay strip. In key embodiments, the patch includes a heat-activated adhesive such that, when the patch is applied to the waist-clothing with iron-on heat and pressure, the patch adheres at its back surface to the waist-clothing, thereby securing the stay strip in position to prevent the waist-clothing from riding up and bunching in the crotch area.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of stays for garments and, more particularly, to clothing stays for preventing material of the leg-portions from riding up and bunching in the crotch area of the garment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Waist-garments, such as shorts, swimsuits, even full-length trousers and various other similar garments, often share a particular problem. The material of the leg-portions along the inner-seams tends to ride up and bunch in the crotch area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,076,193 (Hood) describes a clothing arrangement incorporating &#x201c;a stay member secured to the lateral inner area of the pant leg such that the stay member substantially prevents the interior lateral lower edge from moving towards the crotch are when the pant leg is worn by a person.&#x201d; While the Hood invention represents an important advance which overcomes the problem of material riding up and bunching in the crotch area of waist-garments, as described above, significant improvements are need to make such advantages easily available for people experiencing such problems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 2,692,389 (Lamkin) describes a garment stay secured to a garment without sewing it in place. More particularly, the stay is bonded to the garment by a separate patch that, upon application to the garment, traps the stay in place. The patch is bonded to the garment with the use of thermosetting resin and application of heat and pressure. Lamkin's method is complex and difficult to perform.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known garment stays have a variety of additional problems and disadvantages. In some cases, stays may be positioned in locations on garments which cause skin irritation to the wearers. In other cases, sharp ends of the stays may project through cloth, causing a variety of problems, including causing wear at particular points of garment material. Furthermore, a variety of ways providing stays on garments can be problematic. Furthermore, it would be desirable to have garment stay devices overcoming a variety of problems, including those described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This invention, which will be described in detail below, is an improvement in anti-creep stays for waist-clothing of the type having leg-portions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a pre-assembled anti-creep waist-clothing stay device and method of reinforcing crotch-adjacent inner-seam areas overcoming the problems described above. The present invention permits easy and quick waist-clothing retrofitting process without any special skills or equipment. An average person can attach the inventive pre-assembled stay device to the waist-clothing by ironing the stay devices on the crotch adjacent inner-seam areas of the waist-clothing to prevent the waist-clothing material from riding up and bunching in the crotch area. Furthermore, the stay device of the present invention incorporates a boning material having smooth finishing on its ends which eliminates a common disadvantage of known garment stays such as tearing through the material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventive pre-assembled anti-creep waist-clothing stay device includes a patch having front and back surfaces and sized for application to a crotch-adjacent inner-seam area of the waist-clothing, and a stay strip affixed to the back surface of the patch. The stay strip being positioned and sized such that the patch extends beyond edges of the stay strip.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In highly preferred embodiments of this invention the stay strip is affixed to the patch by an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The patch preferably includes a heat-activated adhesive such that, when the patch is applied to the waist-clothing with iron-on heat and pressure, the patch adheres at its back surface to the waist-clothing, thereby securing the stay strip in position to prevent the waist-clothing from riding up and bunching in the crotch area.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain preferred embodiments, the stay strip has an affixed side and a free side. The free side is coated with a contact adhesive for pre-application positioning of the stay device on the waist-clothing. In such embodiments, the contact adhesive on the free side has a peel-off cover thereon to protect the adhesive prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The stay strip may be of any size but preferably no less than about 2 inches long and no more than about one-half inch wide. The stay strip is preferably made of polyester or other polymeric boning materials.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain highly preferred embodiments the stay strip is formed by a plurality of generally parallel interconnected monofilaments each having an end-point. In such embodiments the stay strip has convex curved ends with a smooth finishing formed by the end-points being melted together, thus, eliminating roughness and minimizing tearing of the stay strip through the patch or the waist-clothing. The patch has outer edges which are substantially parallel to the corresponding edges of the stay strip such that iron-on interconnection of the stay device to the waist-clothing can be secure all about the stay strip.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another important aspect of this invention involves a method of reinforcing a waist-clothing of the type having two leg-portions with inner-seams forming a crotch to prevent cloth riding up and bunching in the crotch area. The inventive method includes: providing a pre-assembled anti-creep waist-clothing stay device including a patch having front and back surfaces and sized for application to a crotch-adjacent inner-seam area of the waist-clothing; and a stay strip affixed to the back surface, the strip being positioned and sized such that the patch extends beyond edges of the strip, the patch includes a heat-activated adhesive; placing the stay device on a crotch-adjacent inner-seam area of the waist-clothing with the back of the patch facing the leg-portion; and pressing hot iron on the front surface of the patch for iron-on activation of the heat-reactive adhesive such that the patch adheres at its back surface to the waist-clothing, thereby securing the stay strip in a position to prevent the waist-clothing from riding up and bunching in the crotch area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain preferred examples of the inventive method, the free side of the stay strip is coated with a contact adhesive covered with a protective peel-off film. In such preferred examples, the method includes the further step of peeling the protective film off the free side of the stay strip prior to placing the stay device on the leg-portion. Whereby the contact adhesive holds the stay device in desired position prior to pressing the iron and supports the iron-on attachment of the stay device to the waist-clothing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention further provides an anti-creep waist-clothing of the type having two leg-portions sewn together forming a crotch with each leg-portion having an inner-seam extending from the crotch down along the leg-portion. The pre-assembled anti-creep stay device is adhered to a crotch-adjacent inner-seam area of the waist-clothing. Thus, the anti-creep waist-clothing is free of cloth riding up and bunching in the crotch area.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;waist-clothing,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to garments worn below a person's waist-line and having two leg-portions. Such garments include shorts, skorts, full-length trousers, swimsuits and other similar clothing articles.</p>
