<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the benefits of therapeutic massage are becoming more widely appreciated, more and more people are participating in therapeutic massage. A typical massage table allows the patient to be resting while receiving a massage. A typical massage chair allows the patient to be sitting while receiving a massage. Both types of massage devices include a headrest that supports the head of the patient during a massage. Important features for massage devices include high strength, ease of use, adjustability, light weight, and comfort.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to a headrest assembly for supporting a face of a user of a massage device. The headrest assembly includes a support frame and a resilient assembly. The support frame is coupled to the massage device. The resilient assembly includes a first resilient subassembly that is coupled to the support frame, and a second resilient subassembly that engages the first resilient subassembly. In this embodiment, the first resilient subassembly and the second resilient subassembly cooperate to support the face of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As an overview, in certain embodiments, the headrest assembly provides improved comfort, adjustability, and support to a face or head of the user. Moreover, the headrest assembly can have a relatively low profile and can curve to better &#x201c;wrap&#x201d;, &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;cradle&#x201d; the face.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the first resilient subassembly includes a resilient member that extends away from the support frame and the second resilient subassembly engages the resilient member. The resilient member can include a resilient first beam having a first end that cantilevers away from the support frame. Further, the resilient member can include a resilient second beam that is attached to the first end of the first beam and cantilevers away from the first beam. The second beam can be curved and can cantilever away from the first beam back towards the support frame. Additionally, the resilient member can include a first cover that covers a portion of the first beam and the second beam, and a resilient second cover that covers a portion of the first cover. In one embodiment, the second cover can be softer than the first cover.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first resilient subassembly can also include a plurality of spaced apart resilient members that extend away from the support frame. In this embodiment, the second resilient subassembly engages the plurality of resilient members.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified, side view of a portion of a massage device <b>10</b> having features of the present invention. The design of the massage device <b>10</b> can be varied. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the massage device <b>10</b> is a portable, folding massage table that includes a base <b>11</b>, and a headrest assembly <b>12</b>. One embodiment of a massage table is disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,170, issued to Spehar, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, for example, the massage device <b>10</b> can be another type of massage device, such as a massage chair. One embodiment of a massage chair is disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 6,729,690, issued to Roleder et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an overview, in certain embodiments, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> provides improved comfort and support to a face <b>13</b> and/or head <b>14</b> (illustrated as an oval) of a person <b>16</b> (also referred to as the &#x201c;user&#x201d;) using the massage device <b>10</b>. One ear <b>17</b> of the person <b>16</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> provides improved adjustability to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally or alternatively, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> can be lighter in weight and/or have a smaller form factor than comparable prior art headrest assemblies (not shown). Further, as provided herein, in certain embodiments, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> includes independent type suspension that can better respond to the individual weight and shape of the head <b>14</b> and can curve to better &#x201c;wrap&#x201d;, &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;cradle&#x201d; the face. Moreover, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> can have a relatively low profile.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> is removable and adjustably extends and cantilevers away from the front of the massage base <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> can be positioned at another location. For example, for a massage chair, the headrest assembly <b>12</b> would extend generally upward at an angle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the massage device <b>10</b> includes a headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b> (illustrated in phantom) that can be used to selectively secure the headrest assembly <b>12</b> to the massage device <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b> includes a first headrest receiver (not shown) and a spaced apart second headrest receiver <b>15</b>A that are secured to the front wall of the massage device <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, each of the headrest receivers <b>15</b>A is a generally right cylindrical shaped aperture that extends through the front wall of the massage device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, the headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b> can have another design or can be positioned at another location on the massage device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a partly exploded perspective view of a first embodiment of a headrest assembly <b>212</b> having features of the present invention. In this embodiment, the headrest assembly <b>212</b> includes a frame assembly <b>218</b> and a resilient assembly <b>220</b>. The size, shape and design of each of these assemblies <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> can be varied to achieve the desired design characteristics of the headrest assembly <b>212</b>. Further, the resilient assembly <b>220</b> defines a face opening <b>221</b> for receiving a portion of the face of the user <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the resilient assembly <b>220</b> is contoured so that one size fits all faces.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the frame assembly <b>218</b> includes a support arm assembly <b>222</b>, an adjuster assembly <b>224</b>, and a support frame <b>226</b>. The support arm assembly <b>222</b> couples the other elements of the headrest assembly <b>212</b> to the rest of the massage device <b>10</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In one embodiment, the support arm assembly <b>222</b> includes a first support arm <b>228</b>, a spaced apart second support arm <b>230</b> that is somewhat parallel to the first support arm <b>228</b>, and an arm connector <b>232</b> that couples the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> together. In this embodiment, a portion of each support arm <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> extends into a corresponding headrest receiver <b>15</b>A (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the massage base <b>11</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to facilitate selective attachment and detachment of the headrest assembly <b>212</b> to the massage base <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> are spaced apart approximately eight inches and the headrest receivers <b>15</b>A are spaced apart approximately eight inches. Alternatively, the spacing between the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> and the headrest receivers <b>15</b>A can be greater than or less than eight inches.</p>

In one embodiment, each arm engagement region <b>238</b>F can have a generally rectangular shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The connector latch <b>238</b>B selectively clamps the components retained by the connector pin <b>238</b>A together. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the connector latch <b>238</b>B is a flip type latch that can be selectively moved between a locked position <b>238</b>I and an unlocked position (not shown). In this embodiment, the connector latch <b>238</b>B is selectively rotated relative to the latch pin <b>238</b>H during movement between the positions <b>238</b>I. With this design, the connector latch <b>238</b>B can be selectively rotated relative to the connector pin <b>238</b>A to selectively urge support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> together in the locked position <b>238</b>I or to allow the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> to move apart in the unlocked position. In this embodiment, the connector latch <b>238</b>B is a &#x201c;quick release&#x201d; type of mechanism that allows for one-handed locking/unlocking, while using another hand is used to adjust position. However, other suitable latches can be used that carry out the intent of the present invention provided herein. For example, the connector latch <b>238</b>B can be a nut (not shown) that engages an externally threaded surface at the latch end <b>238</b>D of the connector pin <b>238</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the arm apertures <b>234</b>G in each support arm <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> can be a generally rectangular shaped opening that is sized and shaped to engage one of the arm engagement regions <b>238</b>F of the connector pin <b>238</b>A. With this design, the connector pin <b>238</b>A inhibits relative rotation between the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> irregardless of the orientation of the connector latch <b>238</b>B. Alternatively, for example, each arm aperture <b>234</b>G and each arm engagement region <b>238</b>F can have a triangular shape, a hexagon shape, an oval shape, or an octagonal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With this design, the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> do not rotate relative to each other, and the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> remain in substantially the same orientation relative to one another whether the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> are positioned within the massage base <b>11</b> (engaging the headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b>), or whether the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> are removed from the massage base <b>11</b> (not engaging the headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b>). With this design, assembly between the headrest assembly <b>212</b> and the massage base <b>11</b> is facilitated and requires less or no alignment of the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> relative to one another during insertion of the support arms <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> into the headrest receiver assembly <b>15</b> of the massage base <b>11</b>.</p>

As a result thereof, the arm connector <b>232</b> is less visible and the user is less likely to touch the arm connector <b>232</b> with their chin when they have their face positioned in the headrest assembly <b>212</b>. Stated in another fashion, the likelihood of a user of the headrest assembly <b>212</b> inadvertently contacting his or her face against any portion of the arm connector <b>232</b> is reduced or eliminated. Additionally, the headrest assembly <b>212</b> has a more aesthetically pleasing appearance due to the lack of a visible crossbar as viewed from above the headrest assembly <b>212</b>.</p>

The number and design of resilient members <b>360</b> can vary. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the first resilient subassembly <b>256</b> includes eight resilient members <b>360</b>. Alternatively, for example, the resilient subassembly <b>256</b> could be designed to include more than eight or less than eight resilient members <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, all of the resilient members <b>360</b> have are similar in size, shape and design to reduce manufacturing costs.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The comfort of the headrest <b>12</b> is a combination of the posture and face position. Face pressure is best when low and uniform.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates that in one embodiment, the support frame <b>226</b> has a cylindrical curve and the resilient members <b>360</b> have another curve.

However, the resilient member <b>360</b> can have another design.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this embodiment, the resilient first beam <b>362</b> is generally flat, rectangular plate shaped and is made of resilient material, such as spring steel. The resilient first beam <b>362</b> includes a first end <b>362</b>A that cantilevers away from the support frame <b>226</b> and a second end <b>362</b>B that includes a RFB aperture <b>362</b>C for securing the resilient member <b>360</b> to the support frame <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The second resilient beam <b>366</b> is generally curved plate shaped and is made of resilient material. The second resilient beam <b>366</b> includes a first end <b>366</b>A that is fixedly secured to the first end <b>362</b>A of the first resilient beam <b>362</b> and a second end <b>366</b>B that cantilevers away from the first end <b>366</b>A back towards the support frame <b>226</b> and upward. In one, non-exclusive embodiment, the second resilient beam <b>366</b> can have a curved region <b>366</b>C having a relatively large radius.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The second resilient beam <b>366</b> provides a relatively hard cover that provides a large surface area. In one embodiment, the second resilient beam <b>366</b> is a relatively hard plastic that is molded over the first end <b>362</b>A of the first beam <b>362</b> and the second beam <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The resilient cover <b>368</b> provides a relatively soft covering over the second resilient beam <b>366</b>. In one embodiment, the resilient cover <b>368</b> is a soft foam rubber that is molded over the second resilient beam <b>366</b>. Suitable materials for the resilient cover <b>368</b> include natural rubber, foam rubber, urethane rubber, and thermal plastic elastomer. Additionally, the resilient cover <b>368</b> can define a member engagement surface <b>368</b>C that engages the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> in a non-skid fashion. For example, the member engagement surface <b>368</b>C can have a relatively high coefficient of friction and/or can be a rough surface.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It should be noted that the characteristics of the resilient first beam <b>362</b> and/or the characteristics of the second resilient beam <b>366</b> can be adjusted to suit the support requirements of the resilient members <b>360</b>. For example, the thickness and/or the materials used in one or both of the beams <b>362</b>, <b>366</b> can be altered to suit the support requirements. In one embodiment, if it is desired to have more support at the forehead instead of the cheeks, the first beams <b>362</b> used at the forehead can be thicker than the first beams <b>362</b> used near the cheek. Thus, with certain versions, the resilient members <b>360</b> can be designed to achieve the desired support characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additionally, it should be noted that the cantilevering end of the resilient member <b>360</b> can engage the tapered frame section <b>248</b>B to inhibit over travel of the resilient member <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> illustrates the support frame <b>226</b> and that the first beams <b>362</b> can be secured with fasteners <b>370</b> to the support frame <b>226</b>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be noted that two or more of the first beams <b>362</b> can be made as a unitary structure that is attached to the support frame <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3F-3G</figref> illustrate one embodiment of the resilient members <b>360</b> at different stages of bending.

These Figures illustrate that the first beam <b>362</b> bends downward and the curved second beam <b>366</b> bends downward and curves to cradle and conform to the face. With this design, the cover <b>368</b> is substantially parallel with the face when the resilient member <b>360</b> is flexed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in one embodiment, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> stacks on top of the first resilient subassembly <b>256</b>. With this design, the resilient subassemblies <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> cooperate to provide improved comfort to the user. The design of the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> can vary. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> is generally horseshoe or &#x201c;C&#x201d; shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a cut-away view of one, non-exclusive embodiment of the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> taken on line <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In this embodiment, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> includes an interior resilient region <b>472</b> and an outer covering <b>474</b>. Further, in this embodiment, the interior resilient region <b>472</b> includes a first layer <b>472</b>A and a second layer <b>472</b>B that are stacked together with the first layer <b>472</b>A positioned on top of the second layer <b>472</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, the first layer <b>472</b>A and the second layer <b>472</b>B are each made of a foam material. However, in certain embodiments, the stiffness of each layer <b>472</b>A, <b>472</b>B is different. For example, the first layer <b>472</b>A can have a first stiffness that is different than a second stiffness of the second layer <b>472</b>B. In alternative non-exclusive embodiments, the first stiffness is at least approximately 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 percent less stiff than the second stiffness. For example, the first section <b>472</b>A can be made of four or five pound (5 pound density per cubic foot) memory foam and the second section <b>472</b>B can be six pound (6 pound density per cubic foot) memory foam, neoprene foam or stiffer memory foam.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With this design, in certain embodiments, the first layer <b>472</b>A is softer and closer to the face of the user and the second layer <b>472</b>B is harder and is positioned away from the face. As a result thereof, in certain embodiments, the softer first layer <b>472</b>A is able to conform to the smallest features of the face while the second layer <b>472</b>B is stiffer and conforms less than the first layer <b>472</b>A. In certain embodiments, the stiffer second layer <b>472</b>B can inhibit indirect contact (bottoming out of the interior resilient region <b>472</b>) between the face and the rest of the headrest below the second layer <b>472</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, in certain embodiments, the thickness of each layer <b>472</b>A, <b>472</b>B is different. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the first layer <b>472</b>A has a first thickness <b>472</b>C that is different than a second thickness <b>472</b>D of the second layer <b>472</b>B. In alternative, non-exclusive embodiments, the first thickness <b>472</b>C can be approximately 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, or 12 times greater than the second thickness <b>472</b>D. Stated in another fashion, the in alternative, non-exclusive embodiments, the first thickness <b>472</b>C can be approximately &#xbd;, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 inches, and the second thickness <b>472</b>D can be approximately &#x215b;, &#x2159;, &#xbc;, &#x215c;, &#xbd; or &#xbe; inches. Alternatively, the thicknesses <b>472</b>C, <b>472</b>D can be different than these amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Still alternatively, the interior resilient region <b>472</b> could be design without multiple layers or with more than two layers.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The outer covering <b>474</b> protects the interior resilient region <b>472</b>. In one embodiment, the outer covering <b>474</b> is designed to allow for enhanced flexing and bending of the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> so that the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> can conform to the face of the user <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, the outer covering <b>474</b> includes a top <b>474</b>A, a pair of opposed sides <b>474</b>B, and a bottom <b>474</b>C that cooperate to encircle and enclose the interior resilient material <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment, the top <b>474</b>A and the opposed sides <b>474</b>B are made of first material that is not very stretchable and the bottom <b>474</b>C is made of a second material that is stretchable. For example, the first material can be leather or vinyl, and the second material can be made of a nylon rib knit or Polartech fleece fabric. With this design, when the bottom <b>474</b>C is engaging the individual resilient members <b>360</b>, the flexible bottom <b>474</b>C allows the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> to easily bend to conform to the face of the user <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, the bottom <b>474</b>C includes a bottom engagement surface <b>474</b>CA that engages the top of the resilient members <b>360</b> and the high friction interface between these components secures the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> to the first resilient subassembly <b>256</b>. Stated in another fashion, the bottom <b>474</b>C engages the top of the resilient members <b>360</b> in a non-slip fashion with the stiction between the surfaces inhibiting relative movement. Further, the bottom <b>474</b>C flexes and stretches to maintain a surface contact area between the bottom <b>474</b>C and the resilient members <b>360</b> so that the components act like they are fixedly secured together and bend together.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Alternatively, hook and loop type fasteners can be utilized. Further, any other suitable method can be used to secure the resilient subassemblies <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> together. For example, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> can use an elastic rim somewhat similar to a shower cap to secure the resilient subassemblies <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">It should be noted that in certain embodiments, a thinner second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> can be utilized. For example, in alternative, non-exclusive embodiments, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> has a SRS thickness <b>476</b> of approximately 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.5 inches. However, other thicknesses can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In certain embodiments, during usage, the eight resilient members <b>360</b> can seek their own equilibrium position depending on the shape of the head <b>14</b>. In general, the nose and mouth opening will expand as the head <b>14</b> is pressed into the headrest under the weight of the person. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> should be flexible to allow the resilient members <b>360</b> to independently flex to contour to the face of the user</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a bottom perspective view of another embodiment of an interior resilient region <b>472</b>B including the first layer <b>472</b>AB and the second layer <b>472</b>BB. In this embodiment, the second layer <b>472</b>BB is a relatively stiff piece of foam that includes a plurality of spaced apart cut-outs <b>472</b>BC that reduce the lateral stiffness of the second layer <b>472</b>BB. As a result thereof, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> is softer and more bendable and allows the resilient members <b>360</b> to independently flex.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As an example, the second layer <b>472</b>BB can include a piece of Q-31 foam which is sold by G &#x26; M Foam, located in California.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, the cut-outs <b>472</b>BC reduce the strength of the second layer <b>472</b>BB in tension while not significantly influencing the strength of the second layer <b>472</b>BB in compression. For example, the cut-outs <b>472</b>BC can be die-cut and arranged in a pattern to soften the second layer <b>472</b>BB to allow for increased lateral stretch (from left ear to right ear) while not significantly influencing how the second layer <b>472</b>BB compresses up and down. Stated in another fashion, the cut-outs <b>472</b>BC change the stiffness of the second layer <b>472</b>BB in tension without significantly influencing the compression properties of the second layer <b>472</b>BB in any direction, including up and down. With this design, in certain embodiments, the second layer <b>472</b>BB provides the desired support up and down while allowing for the second layer <b>472</b>BB to flex and stretch laterally. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the cut-outs <b>472</b>BC are slots that are aligned in spaced apart rows that extend from the top to the bottom of the second layer <b>472</b>BB. In one embodiment, the slots extend through the entire thickness of the second layer <b>472</b>BB. Further, in certain embodiments, at least some of the slots turn into circles or ovals during bending of the second layer <b>472</b>BB. Alternatively, the cut-outs <b>472</b>BC can have a different shape, depth and pattern than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In certain embodiments, the die-cut second layer <b>472</b>BB is weak and can be damaged, has a thickness of approximately 0.625 inches, and is bonded to a 2 inch thick piece of memory foam first layer <b>472</b>AB to improve strength and durability.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In yet another embodiment, the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> can include a piece of memory foam cushion that is enclosed with a Polartec fleece cover. In some cases, 1 inch thick of memory foam is sufficient. One advantage of this design is that both materials can stretch and follow the opening of the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a top perspective view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is an exploded bottom perspective view of outer covering <b>774</b> that can be used for the second resilient subassembly <b>258</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In one embodiment, effort is made to allow the outer covering <b>774</b> to stretch while providing a surface that engages the face that can be easily cleaned. In one embodiment, the top <b>774</b>A is sewn together with 3 sections, namely a pair of spaced apart cheek sections <b>790</b>A that engage the cheeks of the user and a forehead section <b>790</b>B that engages the forehead of the user. Moreover, the outer covering <b>774</b> includes the bottom <b>774</b>C and the sides <b>774</b>B. In one embodiment, the cheek sections <b>790</b>A and the forehead section <b>790</b>B also define the inner circumference of the covering <b>774</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one embodiment, the sections of the outer covering <b>774</b> are sewn together in a fashion to avoid a sewing seam that extends from the left eye to the right eye. As a result thereof, the outer covering <b>774</b> allows for more lateral stretching.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Additionally, in one embodiment, the sections of the top <b>774</b>A and the sides <b>774</b>B are made of a durable material that can be easily cleaned and that resists stains such as vinyl or leather. Further, the bottom <b>774</b>C is made with a stretchable, rib knit material that can stretch 4 ways. In one embodiment, the most elastic direction is oriented from the left the right. With this design, in certain embodiments, the portions of the outer covering <b>774</b> that are engaged by the face can be readily cleaned and the portion that engages the resilient members <b>360</b> can easily stretch to conform to the movement of the resilient members <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a simplified illustrated view of another embodiment of a headrest assembly <b>812</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also illustrates a face <b>813</b> of a person <b>816</b>. In this embodiment, the width of the support frame <b>826</b> can be easily adjusted to adjust to different sizes and shapes of faces <b>813</b> and/or jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The design of the adjustable support frame <b>826</b> can vary. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the adjustable support frame <b>826</b> includes a first frame section <b>894</b>A, a second frame section <b>894</b>B, a section connector <b>894</b>C, and a section adjuster <b>894</b>D. In this embodiment, the first frame section <b>894</b>A is rigid and is positioned along the right side of the face <b>813</b>, and the second frame section <b>894</b>B is rigid and is positioned along the left side of the face <b>813</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The section connector <b>894</b>C connects the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B together and allows the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B to move relative to each other to adjust the width of the support frame <b>826</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the section connector <b>894</b>C is a pin that pivotably connects the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The section adjuster <b>894</b>D can be used to precisely adjust the positions of the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B to adjust the width of the support frame <b>826</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the section adjuster <b>894</b>D includes an externally threaded member <b>896</b>A, an internally threaded knob <b>896</b>B that engages the externally threaded member <b>896</b>A, and a bias member <b>896</b>C that urges the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B apart. With this design, rotation of the knob <b>896</b>B in the clockwise direction causes the distance between the distal ends of frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B to become more narrow, and rotation of the know <b>896</b>B in the counter-clockwise direction causes the distance between the distal ends of frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B to become wider. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a portion of the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B is illustrated at a first position <b>898</b>A (in phantom) which is the widest, a portion of the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B is illustrated at a second position <b>898</b>B which is narrower than the first position <b>898</b>A, and a portion of the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B is illustrated at a third position <b>898</b>C (in phantom) which is the narrowest. It should be noted that the frame sections <b>894</b>A, <b>894</b>B can be adjusted to other positions than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Only the support frame <b>826</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. It should be noted that the headrest assembly <b>812</b> can be designed to be implemented in the headrest assembly <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. For example, the headrest assembly <b>812</b> can include the first resilient subassembly and/or the second resilient subassembly described above.</p>
