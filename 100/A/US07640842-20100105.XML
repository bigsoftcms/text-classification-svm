<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a prepacked serving of coffee powder for use in espresso coffee machines, and to a dispensing unit for an espresso coffee making machine suitable for use with the said prepacked serving.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is an increasing trend for espresso coffee to be made with cartridges containing prepacked coffee servings and using machines in which the dispensing units are specially made to reach the best result from the particular cartridge that is used. There is no doubt that the use of prepacked servings makes operations much easier and renders the use of the machines highly adaptable to different user requirements, being characterised by great practicality, cleanliness and most importantly a good average quality of product, meaning the brewed coffee which is served.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many problems have to be overcome in providing a system capable of performing satisfactorily in this area, and they relate to numerous aspects of both production and operations. In the first place, the choice of the material and shape to be given to the cartridge is the outcome of a series of considerations covering on the one hand how to ensure the best movement of the hot water through the coffee powder, and on the other hand how to ensure that its movement is slow enough for the powder to be brewed, this stage is usually known as prebrewing. Many different products have been supplied for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many cartridges, the walls next to the water dispensing means and next to the brewed coffee dispensing means are made of a material that is permeable or perforated to make it so. This simplifies the manufacture of the coffee machine's dispensing unit, but it is not possible to bring about a certain pressure increase inside the cartridge for better brewing. In any case, this kind of cartridge is inevitably permeable to the air and therefore must itself be packed in such a way as to prevent ageing, and especially the development of rancid qualities (oxidation of the coffee) in the coffee powder contained inside it. To avoid this problem, these cartridges are normally packed in an inert atmosphere, in an operation that has extremely high costs when set against the cost of a single cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another approach, the cartridge is made entirely of an impermeable material, plastic or metal, and is perforated at one end by the pressurized hot-water supply means. The cartridge then &#x201c;explodes&#x201d; against a plurality of reliefs which burst the opposite wall and which contain a plurality of channels communicating with the coffee dispensing means. This system not only requires very high operating pressures, but is also based on passing the brewed coffee through very tortuous passages, which can easily become blocked up because of the inherent nature of the brew, namely the presence of solid particles, oils and fats.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a prepacked serving of coffee powder for an espresso machine which will not only not make it difficult to reach the kind of pressures that will produce a brew of pleasing quality, but will also protect the machine in which it is used from potential clogging due to build-up of the particulates and oils present in the brew, and it has a competitive packing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of the present invention is a dispensing unit that can be used effectively with the said serving, and that is of a simple structure and capable of operating without requiring repeated maintenance and cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the present invention is therefore a prepacked serving of coffee powder, particularly for an espresso coffee making machine, comprising a cartridge enclosing a given portion of coffee powder, the said cartridge comprising an essentially cylindrical side wall provided at its two ends with a first wall designed to be acted upon by the pressurized hot-water supply means, and with a second wall designed to be acted upon by the brewed coffee dispensing means, the said cartridge being made of an essentially airtight material, and the said wall being continuous and made of a thermoplastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment the said first wall is provided with predetermined fracture areas to facilitate the action of the pressurized hot-water supply means. Means for diffusing the pressurized hot water over the surface of the coffee serving contained in the said cartridge may also be provided on the said first wall.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Similarly, the said second wall may also have means for channelling and collecting the brew which comes out of the compressed coffee powder contained in the cartridge. The structure of the said first and second walls may also be at least partly stiffened in order to locally differentiate the resistance to piercing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another subject of the present invention is a dispensing unit for an espresso coffee making machine that can be used with a prepacked serving of the type described above, the unit comprising pressurized hot-water supply means, a brewing chamber and dispensing means for dispensing the brewed coffee; the said dispensing means comprise perforating means for forming at least one hole in that wall of the cartridge of the said serving which faces the said means, the lips of the said hole forming a seal around the said perforating means until a defined pressure has built up.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first embodiment of the present invention: reference <b>1</b> is the prepacked cartridge containing the serving of coffee. The cartridge <b>1</b>, containing the coffee powder <b>40</b>, is placed in the brewing chamber <b>31</b> recessed into the door <b>30</b> of an espresso coffee making machine. This door is hinged to the machine at <b>37</b> and is provided with an opening lever <b>35</b>. The cartridge <b>1</b> comprises a cylindrical side wall <b>101</b>, and a wall <b>201</b> which faces the head <b>23</b> containing the axial mouth <b>22</b> communicating with hot-water supply pipe <b>21</b>, which in turn communicates with the boiler <b>20</b>. As can be seen, around the edge of the wall <b>201</b> is the annular relief <b>231</b> which makes leak-tight contact with the head <b>23</b>, the wall <b>201</b> having been axially broken in at the portions <b>211</b> by the mouth <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">On the opposite side of the cartridge <b>1</b>, the wall <b>301</b> facing the back wall of the brewing chamber <b>31</b> contains the diffusion partitions <b>311</b>, on which the layer of filter material <b>401</b>, paper or the like rests and which separates the said wall <b>301</b> from the coffee powder <b>40</b>. The dispensing manifold <b>32</b> communicating with the dispensing pipe <b>33</b> is formed in the back wall of the chamber <b>31</b>: projecting axially from the said manifold is the punch <b>34</b> which in the figure is shown stuck into the wall <b>301</b>, forming the hole <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show more clearly the features of the cartridge of the invention (identical numerals are used for identical parts). As can be seen, in the centre of the wall <b>201</b> of the cartridge <b>1</b> are two prefracture lines <b>221</b> which allow the portions <b>211</b> to break under the action of the mouth <b>22</b>. Similarly, two holes <b>321</b> are shown in chain line on the wall <b>301</b>, the angular distance between them being different from that between two consecutive partitions <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The way in which the prepacked serving in the embodiment described above works will now be explained. The cartridge <b>1</b> is placed in the brewing chamber <b>31</b>, and the door <b>30</b> returned to the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At this point, two things happen: the mouth <b>22</b> breaks through the wall <b>201</b> at the prefracture lines <b>221</b>, depressing the portions <b>211</b> and letting in the pressurized hot water arriving through the pipe <b>21</b>, while at the same time the punch <b>34</b>, or more correctly the two punches <b>34</b>, as implied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, break through the wall <b>301</b> to form the holes <b>321</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the entry of the punch <b>34</b> into the wall <b>301</b> is visible, with the consequent formation of the hole <b>321</b>. Because of the nature of the material&#x2014;basically a thermoplastic, in which at least the wall <b>301</b> of the cartridge <b>1</b> is made, the edges of this hole <b>321</b> form a seal around the said punch <b>34</b>. This seal effectively allows the water introduced into the cartridge <b>1</b> to reach a defined pressure before the coffee is dispensed (pre-brewing); at the same time, however, it is important that the wall <b>301</b> should not collapse completely, so the pressure of the water fed into the cartridge can be much less than that used in other appliances known in the prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, meanwhile, shows the moment at which the pressure in the cartridge, due to the pressurized hot water fed into the cartridge from the opposite side, overcomes the strength of the seal of the lip of the hole <b>321</b>, allowing the brewed coffee to come out. By this simple means the coffee powder is brewed more satisfactorily and at the same time the freshness of the coffee powder is preserved in a very simple and inexpensive way, as the whole of the cartridge <b>1</b> is made of an airtight material and therefore prevents the product contained within it from ageing and becoming rancid (oxidation of the coffee).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the supply head <b>23</b> has its mouth <b>24</b> pushed axially into the wall <b>501</b> of the cartridge <b>1</b>. The wall has diffusion partitions <b>511</b> similar to those provided in the wall <b>301</b> on the opposite side of the cartridge (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>). Also, between the coffee powder <b>40</b> and the wall <b>501</b> is a layer <b>601</b> of filter material. The variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by contrast shows a supply head <b>26</b> provided with a plurality of mouths <b>27</b> pushed through the wall <b>701</b> of the cartridge <b>1</b>. The head <b>26</b> communicates with the pipe <b>21</b> through the manifold <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In both these two variants, the purpose is basically similar, if addressed in different ways: in both cases the aim is to achieve the best possible distribution of the flow of hot water into the cartridge <b>1</b>. In the variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the purpose is achieved by breaking up the flow arriving from the mouth <b>24</b> by means of the partitions <b>511</b>, while in the variant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the flow of water is broken up upstream by providing a greater number of mouths <b>27</b> capable of acting on the surface of the wall <b>701</b>. The result in both cases is a better distribution of the flow of hot water through the coffee powder, so that it does not follow preferred paths which would basically run along the axis of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another embodiment of the prepacked serving according to the present invention. The cartridge <b>2</b> is provided with the essentially cylindrical side wall <b>102</b>, at the ends of which are the walls <b>202</b> and <b>302</b>. The wall <b>302</b> has radial stiffening ribs <b>212</b> which run out from the central disc <b>222</b>. There is also an annular relief <b>232</b>, similar to that illustrated in respect of the cartridge <b>1</b> described earlier. The wall <b>302</b> is essentially a frustum of a cone culminating in a disc <b>322</b> which comprises a thin area <b>332</b> around its perimeter. Rising inwards from the wall of the cartridge are the diffusion partitions <b>312</b>, formed in a similar way to and for the same purposes as those described previously. The cutting profile <b>380</b> of the pin <b>38</b> is designed to act on the disc <b>322</b>. In the embodiment described above, the wall <b>202</b> facing the pressurized water supply means exhibits certain special features. To be specific, in place of the prefracture lines formed in the wall <b>201</b> of the capsule <b>1</b>, it has ribs <b>212</b> which make the wall portion <b>202</b> in which they are formed more rigid, allowing the water supply means to break through in the area of the disc <b>222</b>. Similarly, the partitions <b>312</b> have essentially the same purpose in the wall <b>302</b>, besides contributing to the percolation of the brew towards the hole which the pin <b>38</b> will form in the area of the disc <b>322</b>. Advantageously, the wall <b>302</b> slopes uniformly towards the said disc <b>322</b> in order further to help the brewed coffee to come out.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cartridge <b>3</b> has an essentially cylindrical side wall <b>103</b> at the edge of the wall <b>203</b>, on which wedge-like reliefs <b>243</b> are formed, surrounded by the thin areas <b>213</b> and <b>223</b>. As may be seen in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each relief <b>243</b> is of a decreasing height. Around its outer edge is the thin area <b>213</b> and at its lower end is the thin area <b>223</b> of the wall <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows how the cartridge <b>3</b> works. At the moment when the door <b>30</b> is closed, the reliefs <b>243</b> come into contact with the wall <b>28</b> of the head <b>23</b>, and are pushed into the cartridge <b>3</b>. The thin areas <b>213</b> break, while the thin areas <b>223</b> allow the reliefs <b>243</b> to bend into the cartridge. In this way, although the head <b>23</b> has no means of penetration, openings are formed in the wall <b>203</b> of the cartridge <b>3</b> that allow the pressurized hot water to enter the serving of coffee powder <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention has been described and illustrated with reference to an espresso coffee making coffee in which the brewing chamber is mounted in a hinged door; however, it will be obvious that by making limited suitable modifications, the same technique can also be adapted to all ordinary espresso coffee machines using a traditional filter holder, and that it can also be extended advantageously to coffee makers with direct-heating boilers, that is &#x201c;moka&#x201d; type coffee makers.</p>
