<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is based on an arrangement, by which a shower head, which may be detachable, if desired, is supported such that it may be pivoted.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">That hand-held shower head may be attached to a console using, for example, conical holders whose heights are adjustable on a wall-mounted rod, is generally known. The wall-mounted rod allows adjusting the height of the shower head to suit the heights of user having various heights and pivoting it in order to change its angle of inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A shower fixture where a pivotable shower head is attached to the far end of a wall-mounted arm, which, in turn, is attached to a console such that it is pivotable thereon, is also known. The water supply to that shower head takes place through the wall-mounted arm, which is configured in the form of a length of hollow, profiled stock (cf. German Patent DE 100 48 987).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also known is a shower fixture (SE 95 879) where a receptacle for inserting the grip of a hand-held shower head is arranged on the far end of an adjustable, wall-mounted arm. The wall-mounted arm has a joint situated approximately midway along its length.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is based on the problem of creating a simply constructed shower fixture that provides users with additional showering opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve that problem, the invention proposes a shower support having those features stated in the pending claims. Elaborations on the invention are covered under subclaims.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the wall-mounting arm jutting out of the mounting fixture is pivoted on the mounting fixture and the holder for the shower head that is attached to the wall-mounting arm, in the vicinity of that end thereof that is opposite the mounting fixture is pivoted on the wall-mounting arm. That arrangement of dual pivots allows orienting the direction of the stream of water exiting the shower head more closely around users' desires. Furthermore, it will no longer be necessary to adjust the height of the mounting fixture by sliding it along a wall-mounted rod if the wall-mounted arm proves too long or short, although such will, of course, still be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the axis about which the holder for the shower head pivots is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the wall-mounted arm. Although the wall-mounted arm is not necessarily straight, it may be presumed to have an approximate longitudinal axis that is orthogonal to the axis about which the shower head pivots.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The pivot axis on the mounting fixture for mounting the wall-mounted arm thereon may have arbitrary orientations. However, it will be particularly sensible if it is parallel to the surface of a wall, to which the mounting fixture is fastened, where the wall involved may be any vertical surface of a shower stall or similar, and need not be a bathroom wall. Of course, the mounting fixture may also ride on a vertical or horizontal rod.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In further elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the pivot axis is horizontal and passes between the mounting fixture and the wall-mounting arm.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It will be particularly sensible if the two pivot axes are parallel to one another, in which case, for example, in order to preserve the direction of the stream of water exiting the shower head, the holder for the shower head may be pivoted in the opposite direction when the wall-mounted arm is pivoted upward, which is why it may also be provided that the maximum pivot angle of the holder for the shower head, relative to the wall-mounted arm, is at least equal to the maximum pivot angle of the wall-mounted arm, relative to the mounting fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the wall-mounting arm in configured such that it is forked, at least in the vicinity of its far end, in which case, the holder for the shower head may be arranged between the two tines of the fork.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The forking of the wall-mounting arm might, for example, commence approximately midway along its length.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In further elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the pivot axis of the holder for the shower head intersects the shower head near its centroid (near the centroid of the shower head housing in the embodiments shown), which will lead to the absolute position of the shower head's housing remaining unchanged when the direction of water exiting the shower head is changed by pivoting the shower head.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the holder for the shower head is configured to engage a location on the shower head's housing that is not recognizable as such and acts by means of an interference fit in the withdrawal/insertion direction, which will allow attaching a shower head to the shower-head support, where the support need not be joined to a device that engages the hand-held shower head's grip. In particular, there are no visible indications that the shower head is intended for, and suitable for, attachment to a wall-mounted support. Designers thus have much greater freedom in designing the shower head and its housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular, the holder may be configured such that it engages the outer perimeter of the shower head's housing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, the holder should be configured such that it engages a location on the shower head's housing that is provided for that purpose, but is not recognizable as such from its shape. The properties of certain locations on the outer surface of its housing might also be configured for holding purposes, without affecting the shape thereof, which, in the case of that further elaboration, will also preclude that that particular location, or those particular locations, thereon will be recognizable as intended for interaction with the holder from the shape of the shower head's housing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention proposes that, in elaborating thereon, the shower head remain functional while detached from the holder in order that may be employed as a shower head, both while it is attached to the wall-mounting support and while it is detached therefrom, which will significantly improve its utility.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the invention, it may be provided that holder is rigidly attached to the wall-mounting arm. However, the holder, together with the shower head inserted therein, may also be pivotable about an axis orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the wall-mounting arm, and that particular option is covered by the invention. This latter option will allow adjusting the angle of the shower head in order to vary the direction of the exiting stream of water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shower support may be permanently mounted on, for example, a wall, a column within a shower stall, a rod mounted on a wall, or a length of profiled stock mounted on a wall, using the mounting fixture, in which case, its mountings may be such that it may be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the wall-mounting arm is pivotable about an axis parallel to the wall, in the vicinity of that end thereof that is coordinated to the mounting fixture, which may be used to adjust it to suit users of various heights. That axis may be horizontal, and may also be rotatable about an axis orthogonal to the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the event that both the wall-mounting arm and the holder are arranged such that they are pivotable, in elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the two pivot axes are parallel to one another, in which case, the orientation of the shower head inserted into the holder thereon may be counteradjusted in order to correct for the change in direction of the stream of water exiting therefrom when the wall-mounting arm is pivoted.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to arrive at a particularly sensible and, in spite of the shower head's not having been specially adapted to fit in the holder, reliable, mounting, according to the invention, it may be provided that the holder engages two, diametrically opposed, locations on the shower head's housing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The holder may, for example, have a pair of jaws that are configured for engaging the shower head's housing, for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the invention, it may be provided that the jaws are drawn together while a shower head is inserted therein. That drawing together may be effected by inserting the shower head therein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In further elaborating on the invention, it may be provided that the two jaws on the holder are connected by a component exerting a tensioning thereof that causes their contacting surfaces to abut against the shower head.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, the clamping component may be configured such that contact between the clamping component and shower head will occur at least two locations on the latter while a shower head is inserted therein, which may be accomplished by adapting the shape of the clamping component to suit the shape of the shower head's housing, or by configuring the clamping component such that it is flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The clamping component, or tensioning component, that connects the jaws on the holder may also be configured such that it does not contact the shower head's housing at any location thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The forking of the wall-mounting arm will allow arranging the holder between the two tines of its fork.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a greatly simplified side view of a shower support according to the invention. In the case of the example shown, this shower support is mounted on a wall <b>1</b>. A mounting fixture <b>2</b>, which, in the case of the example shown, is in the form of a console <b>3</b> that, for example, is bolted to the wall, serves to attach it to the wall. Within the console <b>3</b>, the shower support is connected to a water line coming from a mixer faucet. A wall-mounting arm <b>5</b> is pivoted on a protrusion <b>4</b> on the console <b>3</b>. Its pivot axis is horizontal and normal to the plane of the paper. A setscrew that may be operated by a knob <b>6</b> holds the wall-mounting arm <b>5</b> in place at a particular angular position. The wall-mounting arm extends outward from the mounting fixture <b>2</b>, away from the wall, and terminates at its far end <b>7</b>. A receptacle, which is not depicted in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for a shower head <b>8</b> is attached to the wall-mounting arm <b>5</b>, in the vicinity of the latter's far end <b>7</b>. In the case of the embodiment shown, the shower head <b>8</b> is disk-shaped, and has a handgrip <b>9</b> that is slightly angularly offset with respect to the plane of the shower head <b>8</b>. A shower hose <b>10</b> that is fed through the handgrip <b>9</b> hangs downward therefrom, details of which have not been shown. The other end of the shower hose <b>10</b> is connected to the mounting fixture <b>2</b>. As has been mentioned, the wall-mounting arm <b>5</b> may be pivoted about a horizontal axis in order that it may be take on various angular positions with respect to the wall when pivoted upward and downward. The angular travel of the wall-mounting arm is, for example, 180.degree.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a simplified view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Commencing a short distance away from the location thereon where it is attached to the console <b>3</b>, the wall-mounting arm <b>5</b> splits, thereby forming a pair of tines <b>11</b> that are configured such that they diverge, but become parallel to one another in the vicinity of the far end <b>7</b> of the wall-mounting arm, where a holder <b>13</b> that has been mentioned earlier is provided between the tips <b>12</b> of the tines <b>11</b>. The holder retains the shower head <b>8</b>, which is therefore situated between those tips <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">How the holder looks will be evident from a first example thereof shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The housing of the shower head <b>8</b> is disk-shaped and configured to have a perimeter that is approximately elliptical. Arranged on the on the inner surfaces of the two tines <b>11</b> of the wall-mounting arm <b>5</b> are a pair of jaws <b>14</b>, whose inner surfaces have contours that match the contour of the outer surface of the shower head's housing, which will allow their accommodating the shower head <b>8</b> by means of a sort of interference fit, where the interference fit acts upward and downward. However, their clamping action normal to the plane of the paper is by means of a tensioning of the jaws. Either an indirect clamping in each of the clamping jaws <b>14</b> or a tensioning of the two clamping jaws <b>14</b> toward one another occurs for that purpose. That tensioning of the two clamping jaws <b>14</b> toward one another may be obtained by providing that their separation is somewhat less than the corresponding lateral dimension, or diameter, of the housing of the shower head <b>8</b>, which will provide a tensioning due to inserting the shower head's housing into the gap between the two clamping jaws <b>14</b>, along a direction normal to the plane of the paper. The tensioning will thus be due to a deformation of the pair of tines <b>11</b> of the wall-mounting arm. The extensions of the clamping jaws <b>14</b> normal to the plane of the paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are relatively short in order that they will engage the shower head's housing over a very short length <b>16</b> along its circumference at two, diametrically opposed, locations thereon only, which is depicted in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how the pair of jaws <b>14</b> might be interconnected by a bail <b>15</b> that is either adapted to suit the shape of the housing of the shower head <b>8</b> or is configured such that it is flexible enough to adapt to suit its shape. The bail <b>15</b>, which is essentially stressed in tension, may reinforce the clamping action.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pair of clamping jaws <b>14</b> are mounted on the tips <b>12</b> of the tines <b>11</b> of the wall-mounting arm such that they may be rotated in order that the holder, together with the shower head <b>8</b>, may be pivoted about a horizontal axis. A detenting component, similar to the knob <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may be provided in order to clamp the shower head in place at a certain position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The shower head may be grasped by its grip <b>9</b> and withdrawn from the holder along a direction normal to the plane of the paper, preferably toward the wall. If the contours of the inner surfaces of the jaws <b>14</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are arcs of circles, a certain detention of the shower head's housing in the holder will also occur, without need for the shower head's housing having a shape such that it may be recognized that it has been designed to be held in place at the locations thereon involved. While the shower head is withdrawn from the holder, there are no signs that it is intended for attachment to a shower support.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> differs from the foregoing embodiments in that the wall-mounting arm <b>25</b> is merely a single arm <b>11</b> that, however, is asymmetrically arranged, rather than forked. A holder <b>13</b> is arranged on one side of the arm <b>11</b>, in the vicinity of its far end <b>12</b>. In this case as well, the holder <b>13</b> may contain a tensioning component <b>15</b> that draws the two jaws <b>14</b> on the holder toward one another, at least while the housing of the shower head <b>8</b> is inserted therein. A knurled knob <b>24</b> may be attached to one end of the tensioning component in order to rotate it about the outer axis.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this case, the console <b>3</b>, which is fastened to the wall <b>1</b>, consists of two-parts <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The part <b>3</b><i>b</i>, which carries the pivot axis for the wall-mounting arm <b>25</b>, may be rotated as a whole about an axis <b>23</b> that is orthogonal to the surface of the wall, and thus horizontal, and is indicated by the dashed line.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Of course, an embodiment, wherein the arm <b>11</b> is straight and extends outward, away from the console <b>3</b>, and the holder <b>13</b> is attached to the midpoint of the tip <b>12</b> of the arm <b>11</b> is also feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a representation corresponding to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of a holder <b>13</b> for the housing of a shower head <b>8</b>, where, in the interest of greater clarity, the housing of the shower head <b>8</b> has been deleted. The tensioning component <b>15</b>&#x2032; connecting the two jaws <b>14</b> is configured in the form of a bail running parallel to the line joining them in order that the housing of the shower head <b>8</b> will not come into contact with the tensioning component <b>15</b>&#x2032; when it is inserted into the jaws <b>14</b>. Nevertheless, this component <b>15</b>&#x2032; is also configured in the form of a tensioning component in order to generate the clamping force needed for retaining the housing of the shower head <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an embodiment similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where just the holder for the shower head has been modified. A conical holder <b>27</b>, into which the grip of the shower head <b>28</b> is inserted, is attached to the arm <b>5</b>, in the vicinity of its far end <b>7</b>. Conical holders of that type engage the grip, or a cap nut arranged on the end of the grip. The opportunity for attachment proposed by the invention is thus applicable to all types of hand-held shower heads that may be attached to a wall-mounted arm using a holder.</p>
