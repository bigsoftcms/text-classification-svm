<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a mounting assembly, and more specifically to a mounting assembly and a method of mounting bathroom accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bathroom accessories, such as, for example, towel racks, towel rings, and tissue holders, are typically attached to a wall by a mounting assembly comprising a mounting bracket, a flange, a mounting post and one or more fasteners. Traditional mounting assemblies are attached by using multiple fasteners to attach the mounting bracket to the wall and then securing the mounting post, typically with an integral flange, to the mounting bracket with an additional fastener. Mounting bathroom accessories in this fashion can be very time consuming, especially if a whole collection needs to be mounted. In order to make it easier to mount bathroom accessories, some mounting assemblies have been developed with snap-together features. However, the snap-together features of the prior art have traditionally required elaborate features that require substantial alignment effort and complex manipulation of the components to effectuate the mounting of the assembly. Additionally, the snap-together features require interaction with the flange of the post, thereby requiring an integral flange. Since the flange is a decorative component, it is desirable to provide a mounting assembly that allows interchangeable flanges.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a mounting assembly for a bathroom accessory and a method of mounting a bathroom accessory. The mounting assembly provides an easy way to secure the bathroom accessory. The mounting assembly provides for snap assembly which facilitates easy assembly. In one embodiment the mounting assembly includes a mounting bracket, fastener, flange and post. The mounting bracket, fastener and flange can be preassembled to form a mounting subassembly. In such an embodiment, the accessory is mounted to a wall or other mounting point by securing the mounting subassembly to the mounting point, aligning the post with the mounting bracket, and moving the post axially along the mounting bracket until the post snaps into place.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention includes a mounting assembly for bathroom accessories and a method for mounting bathroom accessories. The mounting assembly <b>10</b> includes a mounting bracket <b>20</b>, a flange <b>25</b>, a post <b>30</b> and a fastener <b>35</b>. The mounting assembly <b>10</b> provides for easy and quick assembly and allows for interchangeability of the flange.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The mounting bracket <b>20</b> is generally cylindrical, although other geometrical shapes are contemplated by the invention. The mounting bracket <b>20</b> includes a base portion <b>40</b>, a body portion <b>42</b>, one or more snap-flanges <b>45</b>, one or more retaining flanges <b>47</b> and one or more ribs <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base portion <b>40</b> is generally cylindrical and fairly thin. The base portion <b>40</b> includes a mounting surface <b>50</b> with at least one mounting aperture <b>52</b> through which a fastener <b>35</b> is placed. As shown in the figures, an anchor is used as the fastener <b>35</b>, however, it should be appreciated that other fasteners, such as, for example, screws, bolts and the like can be used. The body portion <b>42</b> is generally toroidal and extends axially outward from the base portion <b>40</b>. The body portion <b>42</b> is generally hollow, but has a thickness appropriate to provide the requisite strength and durability. The ribs <b>48</b> run axially along the outer surface of the body portion <b>42</b> and provide a friction fit with the post <b>30</b> as described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The body portion <b>42</b> further includes a snap-flange <b>45</b> that is positioned in a u-shaped cutout <b>52</b> that penetrates through a section of the body portion. The snap flange <b>45</b> is generally rectangularly shaped, although other geometries are possible, with a main section <b>54</b> and an extended section <b>56</b>. The main section <b>54</b> is attached to the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b> in the middle of the cut-out <b>52</b>, thereby forming the u-shape of the cutout. The main section <b>54</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> is long enough to allow flexure of snap flange <b>45</b>. The extended portion <b>56</b> is located at one end of the snap flange <b>45</b> and generally is comprised of a camming surface <b>57</b> that extends radially beyond the outer periphery of the body portion <b>42</b>. When the post <b>30</b> is placed over the mounting bracket <b>20</b>, the inner surface of the post not only forms a friction fit with the ribs <b>48</b> of the mounting bracket, but also forces the extended section <b>56</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> inward as the inner surface contacts the camming surface <b>57</b>. The snap flange <b>45</b> will remain inwardly flexed until the extended section <b>56</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> aligns with snap recess <b>60</b> located in the post <b>30</b>. Once the extended section <b>56</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> aligns with snap recess <b>60</b> located in the post <b>30</b>, the extended section <b>56</b> penetrates the snap recesses <b>60</b>, thereby securing the post <b>30</b> to the mounting bracket <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The body portion <b>42</b> may also include a retaining flange <b>47</b> which allows the flange <b>25</b> to be snapped into position on the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. The retaining flange <b>47</b> is generally comprised of the camming surface <b>62</b> that extends radially beyond the outer periphery of the body portion <b>42</b>. When the flange <b>25</b> is placed over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>, the camming surface <b>62</b> contacts the inner surface of the flange <b>25</b>. The inner surface of the flange <b>25</b> forces the retaining flange <b>47</b> inward thereby allowing axial advancement of the flange <b>25</b> over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. The flange <b>25</b> contains a recess <b>64</b>, which when aligned with the retaining flange <b>47</b>, allows the retaining flange to unflex, thereby snapping the flange <b>25</b> into place on the mounting bracket <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The flange, or escutcheon <b>25</b> is generally a decorative piece that snaps on over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the flange <b>25</b> is an integral piece with the post <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the flange <b>25</b> is a separate piece that includes a centered circular aperture <b>65</b> that is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. When the flange <b>25</b> is a separate piece, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the flange <b>25</b> fits over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b> until the retaining flange <b>47</b> snaps the flange into position on the mounting bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The post <b>30</b> is generally a decorative piece that snaps on over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. The post <b>30</b> includes a toroidal body portion <b>66</b> that has a inner diameter that is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. The post <b>30</b> also includes a central cavity <b>67</b> into which the mounting bracket <b>20</b> is disposed thereby hiding the mounting bracket from view. The inner surface of the post <b>30</b> forms a friction fit with ribs <b>48</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the inner surface of the post <b>30</b> contacts the camming surface <b>57</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> forcing it inward and allowing the post to advance axially over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. When the post <b>30</b> is properly mounted, the snap recess <b>60</b> aligns with the extended portion <b>56</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> and allows the snap flange <b>45</b> to unflex. Once the snap flange <b>45</b> unflexes, the post <b>30</b> is snapped into position on the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. The snap recess <b>60</b> may penetrate through the post <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or it may only penetrate partially through the post. When the snap recess penetrates through the post <b>30</b>, the post can be removed by applying radial force to the extended portion <b>56</b> of the snap flange <b>45</b> while applying axial force on the post.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To mount an accessory with the mounting assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention, the mounting bracket <b>20</b> is secured to the wall, or other point of attachment, with the fastener <b>35</b>. Generally, the fastener <b>35</b> can be attached to the mounting bracket <b>20</b> prior to mounting to allow for easier assembly. The flange <b>25</b> is then placed over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b> and snapped into position by the retaining flange <b>47</b>. The post <b>30</b> is then slid over the body portion <b>42</b> of the mounting bracket <b>20</b> and snapped into position by the snap flange <b>45</b>. In order to snap the post <b>30</b> into position, the snap flange <b>45</b> must be aligned with the snap recess <b>60</b> on the post <b>30</b>. This can either be done while the post <b>30</b> is being slid into position on the mounting bracket <b>20</b>, or can be done by rotating the post <b>30</b> about the mounting bracket <b>20</b> once positioned on the mounting bracket <b>20</b>. In one method of method of mounting an accessory, the fastener <b>35</b>, the mounting bracket <b>20</b>, and the flange <b>25</b> are preassembled. This allows an assembler to simply anchor the fastener, mounting bracket and flange subassembly and then push the post <b>30</b> on over the subassembly to snap it into position and then move on to the next mounting assembly. Using this method of mounting greatly reduces the time required to assemble and mount an accessory.</p>
