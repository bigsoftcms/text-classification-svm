<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a mascara applicator for applying a mascara agent to eyelashes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, in a mainstream mascara product for making eyelashes look well-shaped and beautiful, a liquid type or cream type mascara agent is applied to eyelashes by a brush or the like. The application of the mascara agent to the eyelashes is carried out by either holding the eyelashes with a holding type curler (an eyelash curler) for physically curling (shaping) or thermally shaping the eyelashes with an electric heating type curler for curling, and subsequently applying the mascara agent to the eyelashes by use of a brush. The above holding type curler has been disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 9-173130, and the above electric heating type curler has been disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 2002-28020 and Hei 10-192037.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, if an attempt is made to physically curl eyelashes by use of the holding type curler, the eyelashes do not curl well, especially just after waking up or in a humid condition such as a rainy day. In addition, if the operations are repeated, the eyelashes are damaged, cut, and fall out, thus causing problems. Although curling itself is relatively easy if the electric heating type curler is used, a mascara agent must be applied to eyelashes by a brush thereafter, thus the operational complexity has not been improved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, a mascara agent is applied separately after the curling operation, as described above. In addition, the application operation must be repeated many times, making the operation complicated. In some cases, the shape of the eyelashes is again adjusted by use of a curler after applying the mascara agent. In this case, a coating formed on the eyelashes is damaged, and the mascara agent applied to the eyelashes tends to be smeared off by tears or the like. Moreover, since a mascara agent is applied by use of a brush or the like, uniform application is hard to be achieved, and clumps tend to be formed. Further, the application is repeated many times for achieving a volume enhancing effect, but the weight of the mascara agent itself may cause curling down. Therefore, the curling effect after the mascara application does not last.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a mascara applicator in which the curling of eyelashes and the application of a mascara agent to the eyelashes can be performed easily and simultaneously, and in which the mascara agent applied to the eyelashes is smear-proof and clump-free, and has a long lasting curling effect.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above object has been achieved according to the present invention by providing a mascara applicator integrally having curling means for holding eyelashes to curl the eyelashes into a certain shape, mascara adhering means for adhering a mascara agent to the eyelashes, and mascara supplying means for supplying the mascara agent to the mascara adhering means.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to the direct intimate contact of the heating surface of the heating head with the abutting surface of the head receiving member, the intimate contact of the heating surface with the abutting surface includes the indirect intimate contact of the heating surface with the abutting surface with the film-shaped mascara and the eyelashes intervening therebetween, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>). Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), the mascara supplying means <b>4</b> is configured such that the mascara agent is supplied to the mascara transferring means <b>3</b> as the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> having a long tape-like shape and having the mascara agent applied to the surface of a film material. Further, the mascara supplying means may have a mode in which an individual sheet of film-shaped mascara is used by loading it into the mascara applicator of the present invention for each single mascara application operation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is arranged between the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> and in the side of the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> such that a mascara agent coated surface <b>41</b>A is faced to the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b>, and the eyelashes C are inserted into a position between the coated surface <b>41</b>A of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b>. The eyelashes C are then held between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> together with the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>. By heating the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b>, the eyelashes C are curled between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> into a certain shape, and at the same time, the mascara agent on the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is thermally transferred to the eyelashes C.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further in detail, the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment has a nearly rectangular parallelepiped applicator body <b>11</b> and an arm member <b>12</b> which is provided to the top portion of the applicator body and is vertically movable, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), two dry batteries B serving as a power source for heating the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> are attached to the lower half of the front surface (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>)) of the applicator body <b>11</b>. A battery cover <b>13</b> for covering the dry batteries B is provided to the lower half of the front surface of the applicator body <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the heating head <b>5</b> is provided to the upper part of the front surface of the applicator <b>11</b> so as to protrude forward. The heating head <b>5</b> is made entirely of metal and is heatable. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>), the upper surface of the heating head <b>5</b> serves as the heating surface <b>51</b>, and, as viewed from the side, the heating head <b>5</b> is smoothly inclined upwardly from the front surface to the rear surface of the applicator body <b>11</b>. The inclination &#x3b8; of the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>)) is set in accordance with the desired curling shape as appropriate. In the first embodiment, the inclination &#x3b8; is normally 10 degrees to 20 degrees. In addition, in the first embodiment, the heating head <b>5</b> as a whole can rotationally move to change the inclination of the heating surface <b>51</b> with respect to the applicator body <b>11</b>, and thus the curling angle can be changed in accordance with the user's preference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the arm member <b>12</b> has side pieces <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>A positioned on both sides of the upper part of the applicator body <b>11</b>, a rear piece <b>12</b>B positioned in the rear surface of the abovementioned upper part, and the upper piece <b>12</b>C positioned on the upper surface of the applicator body <b>11</b> and above the heating head <b>5</b>. A knob <b>12</b>D for vertically moving the arm member <b>12</b> is formed in the rear piece <b>12</b>B. The front edge of the upper piece <b>12</b>C of the arm member <b>12</b> has a shape concave to the rear edge and conforming to the shape of the user's face (around eyebrows). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the head receiving member <b>6</b> is provided in the lower surface of the upper piece <b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The arm member <b>12</b> is attached to the applicator body <b>11</b> and is vertically movable. When the arm member <b>12</b> is located at the uppermost position, the head receiving member <b>6</b> is apart from the heating head <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). When the arm member <b>12</b> is located at the lowermost position, the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> is brought into intimate contact with the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). The head receiving member <b>6</b> is made of a synthetic resin, and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> has a shape conforming to the inclined shape of the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), a comb member <b>7</b> formed of a plurality of comb teeth extending downward is provided in the front edge side of the lower surface of the upper piece <b>12</b>C of the arm member <b>12</b>, and thus a combing effect can be achieved on the eyelashes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further described are a preferred range of the length and the width of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b>. Since the line of the eyelash roots has a gently curved shape as viewed from the top, the front end of each of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> preferably has a curved shape conforming to the shape of the line of the eyelash roots. However, the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is difficult to be formed into a curved shape. In view of this, the front end shape of each of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> is made linear.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, if emphasis is placed on curling and applying mascara as beautiful as possible into a shape conforming to the shape of the line of the eyelash roots, a preferred design is that a plurality of partial operations are performed. In this case, the length (L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)) of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> is smaller than the entire width of the line of the eyelash roots and is, for example, 10 mm to 15 mm. On the other hand, if emphasis is placed on completing curling and the application of mascara on one side of the eyelashes by a single operation, a preferred design is that the operation is applied to the entire width of the line of the eyelashes at a time. In this case, the length L of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> is equal to or longer than the width of the line of the eyelash roots and is, for example, 30 mm to 40 mm. Also, the width in the depth direction (M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>)) of the heating head <b>5</b> and the head receiving member <b>6</b> is preferably designed to be longer than the length of the eyelashes and is, for example, 10 mm to 15 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A further description of the mascara supplying means <b>4</b> will be given. The mascara supplying means <b>4</b> has the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> having a long tape form, a film case <b>42</b> accommodating the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, and a pair of film reels <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B capable of winding the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, and these members constitute a cartridge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), the cartridge can be removably attached to the front upper half of the applicator body <b>11</b> (above the battery cover <b>13</b>). Preferably, the whole or a part of the film case <b>42</b> is transparent for enabling the remaining amount of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> to be visually checked.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The path of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> from the film reel <b>43</b>A (the lower reel as viewed form the front) to the film reel <b>43</b>B (the upper reel as viewed form the front) originates from the film reel <b>43</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), extends upward in the upper left direction from the film reel <b>43</b>A, and turns to the upward vertical direction. Then the path extends from the upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case <b>42</b> to the outside of the film case <b>42</b>, turns to the right direction, and turns to the downward vertical direction. Subsequently, the path enters from the outside of the film case <b>42</b> into the inside thereof, and reaches the film reel <b>43</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), a gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A (illustrated by a solid line for convenience) is provided inside the upper half portion of the applicator body <b>11</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A is exposed from both side edges of the applicator body <b>11</b> and can be rotated by a finger or the like. Preferably, the applicator body <b>11</b> has a size capable of being held by one hand. The rotational operation of the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A can be carried out by use of a right hand finger as well as a left hand finger, and thus the traveling direction of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> can be designed in accordance with a convenient operational mode.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A pair of vertically separated reel driving shafts <b>45</b>A and <b>45</b>B are provided in the front upper half portion of the applicator body <b>11</b>. The reel driving shaft <b>45</b>A is coaxially connected to the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A. Thus, as the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A is rotated, the reel driving shaft <b>45</b>A is rotated in the same direction. The reel driving shafts <b>45</b>A and <b>45</b>B can be inserted into and engaged with the film reels <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, respectively. Thus, when the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A rotates while the reel driving shafts <b>45</b>A and <b>45</b>B are inserted into and engaged with the film reels <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, respectively, the film reel <b>43</b>A is rotated in the same direction. Moreover, as the film reel <b>43</b>A rotates, the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> wound thereon travels, and the other film reel <b>43</b>B is driven to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the reel driving shafts <b>45</b>A and <b>45</b>B are inserted into the film reels <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, respectively, to mount the film case <b>42</b> (the cartridge) on the applicator body <b>11</b>, the heating head <b>5</b> is arranged between the upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case and the lower surface of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>). If the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A is rotated in the left direction as viewed from the front while the film case <b>42</b> is attached to the applicator body <b>11</b>, the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is unreeled from the upper film reel <b>43</b>B side and wound by the lower film reel <b>43</b>A side.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A switch <b>14</b> (illustrated by a solid line for convenience) is provided inside the front upper half portion of the applicator body <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>). The switch <b>14</b> vertically moves together with the vertical motion of the arm member <b>12</b>. When the arm member <b>12</b> is brought down until the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> is brought into intimate contact with the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b>, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on. When the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> is separated from the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b>, the heating is switched off. Therefore, in the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on while the eyelashes C are held between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> together with the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>)), and the heating is switched off while the heating head <b>5</b> is separated from the head receiving member <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The constitution of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> of the first embodiment will be described in detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is a four-layer laminate formed of a back coat layer a, a base film b, an underlayer c, and a mascara agent layer d laminated in this order from the bottom. When heat is applied to the back coat layer a side, melting and delamination occur mainly in the underlayer c, causing the mascara agent layer d together with a part of the underlayer c to be transferred to eyelashes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The base film b is a base of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, and a material having high heat resistance and properties which are capable of exploiting the characteristics of the transferring layer is employed therefor. In this embodiment, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) having a thickness of 2.5 &#x3bc;m is employed.</p>

In this embodiment, the back coat layer a is formed of a silicone modified butyral resin in an amount of 0.15 g/base film m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the underlayer c is an intervening layer between the base film b and the mascara agent layer d, and a material having film forming properties and low cohesion during heat melting is employed therefor. In this embodiment, the underlayer c is formed of a low molecular weight polyethylene wax and an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in an amount of 1.3 g/base film m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mascara agent layer d is formed on the underlayer c and is a layer to be thermally transferred to eyelashes. A material having excellent water resistance, adhesion properties, curl retention properties, and safety properties, in addition to film forming properties, tinting properties, and thermal responsiveness is employed therefor. In this embodiment, the mascara agent layer d is formed of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, a urethane modified lanolin wax, and an iron oxide in an amount of 1.0 to 1.3 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the mascara agent in the film-shaped mascara contains a shape memory polymer. In this embodiment, the mascara agent contains a polyurethane shape memory polymer (product of POLYSIS Co.).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The description of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> will be given in more detail. The mascara agent composing the mascara agent layer d is thermally transferred to eyelashes as a coating layer adhering to the surface of the eyelashes so as to have a thickness of preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 20 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. For this purpose, the layer thickness of the mascara agent layer d before the thermal transfer is preferably 20 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 50 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A part of the underlayer c (for example, 50 wt. % to 95 wt. %) is melted and delaminated and is thermally transferred to the eyelashes together with the mascara agent layer d so as to coat the mascara agent to a thickness of preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 2 &#x3bc;m to 5 &#x3bc;m. For this purpose, the layer thickness of the underlayer c before the transfer is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The film thickness of the base film b is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 2 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The film-shaped mascara of the mascara applicator of the present invention is not limited to the film-shaped mascara in the above embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Examples of the material for the base film b include synthetic polymer films such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitrile, and polyethylene, and capacitor paper.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Examples of the material for forming the back coat layer a include silicone resin and fluorocarbon resin.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Examples of the material for forming the underlayer c include waxes such as paraffin wax, polyethylene wax, ester wax, carnauba wax, and montan wax, and resin materials such as polyvinyl acetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, and polyvinyl alcohol.</p>

Examples of the shape memory polymer include polyurethane-based (Diary, product of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.), polyisoprene-based, styrene-butadiene-based, and polyethylene-based polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the mascara agent layer d of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is transferred to eyelashes by use of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the above embodiment, a preferred composition of the material for forming the mascara agent layer d is 0 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight of the above wax and 1 part by weight to 20 parts by weight of the above coloring agent with respect to 100 parts by weight of the above resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since a part of the underlayer c is transferred together with the mascara agent layer d to eyelashes, a preferred composition of the material for forming the underlayer c is 0 parts by weight to 20 parts by weight of the above resin material with respect to 100 parts by weight of the above wax.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a preferred mode of use of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>). In the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the film case <b>42</b> (the cartridge) is attached to the applicator body <b>11</b> if the film case <b>42</b> is not attached to the applicator body <b>11</b>. If the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> disposed above the upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case <b>42</b> has already been used, the gear-shaped knob <b>46</b>A is rotated to dispose the unused film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> above the upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the state in which the unused film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is disposed above the upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case <b>42</b>, the applicator body <b>11</b> of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment is held by a hand H as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), and the eyelashes C are disposed between the mascara agent coated surface <b>41</b>A of the film shaped mascara <b>41</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> provided in the lower surface of the upper piece <b>12</b>C of the arm member <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>). While maintaining this state, a forefinger, for example, is placed on the knob <b>12</b>D of the arm member <b>12</b> to bring down the arm member <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), and the eyelashes C are held between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> together with the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>). At this time, the eyelashes C are curled between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> into a certain shape. Simultaneously, the switch <b>14</b> moves downward, and the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on to heat the heating surface <b>51</b>. Therefore, the curling shape of the eyelashes is fixed, and the mascara agent layer d of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is thermally transferred to the eyelashes C.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, according to the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the eyelashes C are curled between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> into a certain shape only by bringing down the arm member <b>12</b>. At the same time, the mascara agent in the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is thermally transferred to the eyelashes C. At this time, the mascara agent adheres uniformly to the eyelashes C without damaging the eyelashes. Thus, according to the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the curling of the eyelashes and the application of the mascara agent to the eyelashes can be performed easily and simultaneously. In addition, the mascara agent applied to the eyelashes is smear-proof and clump-free, and has a long lasting curling effect.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, according to the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, particularly since the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> having a long length is continuously supplied, the fresh coated surface <b>41</b>A can be exposed by shifting the position of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, thereby providing convenience. On the other hand, a mode in which a one-time disposable sheet is used as the film-shaped mascara may be employed. In this case, the mechanism for loading the tape-shaped long film is not required, and thus the constitution of the applicator becomes simpler.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If a material containing a shape memory polymer is employed as the mascara agent, the retention of the curling shape of eyelashes is particularly facilitated. The eyelashes C having the mascara agent transferred thereto are brushed with the comb member <b>7</b>, allowing the eyelashes to be separated one by one. At the same time, the mascara agent in a melted state is spread to make the shape of the eyelashes after the mascara application beautiful. Moreover, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on simply by lowering the arm member <b>12</b>, providing an easy operation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, a second embodiment different from the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the description of the second embodiment, the differences from the first embodiment will mainly be described. When a description is not given, the description of the first embodiment will be applied as appropriate. The principal difference of a mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the second embodiment from the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment is the constitution of the mascara supplying means <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the mascara supplying means <b>4</b> of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the second embodiment, one film reel <b>43</b> for winding the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is provided in a film cassette <b>42</b>.

The path then extends from an upper surface <b>42</b>A of the film case <b>42</b> to the outside, turns to the right direction, and turns downward, enters from the outside of the film case <b>42</b> into the inside thereof. The path then gradually turns to the left direction so as not to contact with the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> wound on the film reel <b>43</b>, and is ejected from an film outlet <b>42</b>B provided in the lower portion of the left side surface of the film case <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A sawtooth-shaped film cutting edge <b>42</b>C is provided in the proximity of the film outlet <b>42</b>B, allowing the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> ejected from the film outlet <b>42</b>B to be cut.

Thus, the end portion of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> cut by the film cutting edge <b>42</b>C adheres to the adhesive for preventing the end portion from being drawn back into the film case <b>42</b>. The other constitution is the same as that of the mascara applicator of the first embodiment. In order to move the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b>, one end portion thereof is drawn out from the film outlet <b>42</b>B of the film case <b>42</b> and is cut by the film cutting edge <b>42</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the second embodiment can be used in the same mode of use as that of the mascara applicator of the first embodiment, and thus the same effects can be attained. In addition, according to the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the second embodiment, the numbers of the film reels and the reel driving shafts can be reduced as compared with those of the mascara applicator of the first embodiment, and thus cost reduction and size reduction (the reduction of the height) of the mascara applicator can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, a third embodiment of the mascara applicator of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>). In the description of the third embodiment, the differences from the second embodiment will mainly be described. When a description is not given, the description of the second embodiment will be applied as appropriate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>), the constitution of a mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the third embodiment is the same as that of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the second embodiment, except that the positional relation between the applicator body <b>11</b> and the mascara supplying means <b>4</b> is different.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Therefore, the applicator body <b>11</b> of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the third embodiment has a form extending from the front to the rear as viewed from the front, and the height of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> as a whole is nearly the same as the height of a film case <b>42</b>, resulting in a constitution in which the size is reduced in the height direction. Moreover, in the front upper portion of the applicator body <b>11</b>, a heating head <b>5</b> is provided toward the front. As in the second embodiment, dry batteries (not shown) for heating a heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> are accommodated inside the applicator body <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A rotating arm member <b>15</b> is provided above the applicator body <b>11</b> so as to cover the top surface of the applicator body <b>11</b>. A head receiving member <b>6</b> is provided in the front end side of the lower surface of the rotating arm member <b>15</b>, and the rear end side of the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotatably connected to the rear end of the applicator body <b>11</b>. When the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotationally moved upward, the head receiving member <b>6</b> provided in the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is separated from the heating head <b>5</b> provided in the applicator body <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>). When the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotationally moved downward, the heating head <b>5</b> is brought into intimate contact with the head receiving member <b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>). In addition, when the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotationally moved downward such that the heating head <b>5</b> is brought into intimate contact with the head receiving member <b>6</b>, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on. When the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotationally moved upward to separate the heating head <b>5</b> from the head receiving member <b>6</b>, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched off.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A mode of use of the mascara applicator <b>1</b> of the third embodiment will be described. First, the rotating arm member <b>15</b> is rotationally moved upward to separate the heating head <b>5</b> from the head receiving member <b>6</b>. Subsequently, the film case <b>42</b> (the cartridge) is attached to the applicator body <b>11</b>, and the unused film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is arranged above the heating head <b>5</b>. While maintaining this state, the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is arranged under eyelashes by holding the applicator body <b>11</b> by hand and bringing the applicator body <b>11</b> close to a user's eye. The rotating arm member <b>15</b> is then rotationally moved downward to hold the eyelashes together with the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b>. At this time, the eyelashes are curled between the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b> and the abutting surface <b>61</b> of the head receiving member <b>6</b> into a certain shape. At the same time, the heating of the heating head <b>5</b> is switched on to heat the heating surface <b>51</b> of the heating head <b>5</b>. Therefore, the curling shape of the eyelashes is fixed, and the mascara agent of the film-shaped mascara <b>41</b> is melted and thermally transferred to the eyelashes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mascara applicator of the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and the modes of use thereof, and modifications may be made as appropriate so long as they do not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Any mascara applicator may be employed as the mascara applicator of the present invention, so long as the applicator integrally has the curling means for holding eyelashes to curl the eyelashes into a certain shape, the mascara adhering means for adhering a mascara agent to the eyelashes, and the mascara supplying means for supplying the mascara agent to the mascara adhering means. As the above mascara adhering means, means for adhering, for example, by means of an ink jet method, laser method, or other method, a mascara agent prepared as ink, toner, or the like may be employed in addition to the above mascara transferring means, so long as the means can adhere a mascara agent to eyelashes. The curling means does not necessarily serve also as the mascara transferring means.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the mascara supplying means, a manner for supplying the mascara agent to the mascara adhering means is not required to be a manner in which film-shaped mascara having a long tape form is continuously supplied. For example, a separate film of the above described mode may be employed by loading for each use a sheet of the film into the mascara applicator of the present invention. Various constitutions may be employed as the constitution in which the heating head and the head receiving member are capable of being brought into intimate contact with each other and separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The above embodiments are configured such that the heating of the heating head is switched on when the heating head and the head receiving member are brought into intimate contact with each other. However, a constitution in which the heating head can be preheated before the heating head and the head receiving member are brought into intimate contact with each other may be employed. According to the curling means (which also serves as the mascara transferring means) configured as above, the heating head can be heated before eyelashes are held between the heating head and the head receiving member, and the eyelashes can be held between the heating head and the head receiving member while maintaining the above state.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the mascara supplying means of the second and third embodiments, the adhesive is employed for preventing the film-shaped mascara from being drawn back into the case. However, in place of the adhesive, a pair of rolls holding one end portion of the film-shaped mascara therebetween may be provided inside the film case as means for preventing the drawing back. If this constitution is employed, the pair of rolls may be configured so as to rotate, upon rotating a knob or the like, in a direction where the film-shaped mascara is ejected. The principle of the mascara applicator of the present invention may be employed for transferring hair manicure to hair and for transferring manicure to a nail.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the mascara applicator of the present invention, the curling of eyelashes and the application of mascara to the eyelashes can be performed easily and simultaneously. In addition, the mascara agent applied to the eyelashes is smear-proof and clump-free, and has a long lasting curling effect.</p>
