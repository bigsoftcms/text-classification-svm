<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Pet doors are a useful means for pets to enter and exit an indoor facility, while at the same time attempting to resist the invasion of unwanted creatures, people, and inclement weather. Pet doors have suffered from inclement weather, however, due to the nature of the rubberized flaps which allow the pet's entrance and exit. Winds, rain and snow can easily enter the flaps. Some devices and adaptations of pet doors have been proposed which are highly exclusive, and therefore not useful to many pets. Some devices are exclusive to the point of negating a pet's use of the pet door device. Most of these devices are also attached to the pet door or to the doorway which houses the pet door, not an always desirable adaptation for the indoor facility structure. What is needed is an apparatus which forms a removably placed vestibule adjacent to a typical pet door. The apparatus should not discourage pet use, and therefore is ideally transparent. The apparatus should not require a significant learning curve for the pet. Further, the apparatus should be collapsible. The apparatus should also be height adjustable in order to best align with a given pet door. The present apparatus provides these problem solutions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The pet door protection apparatus relates to pet doors and more especially to a pet door protection apparatus which shields a pet door and a pet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The general purpose of the pet door protection apparatus, described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a pet door protection apparatus which has many novel features that result in an improved pet door protection apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by prior art, either alone or in combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To attain this, the pet door protection apparatus comprises a majority of transparent components which encourage a pet to remain within, as desired, and encourage pet use. The apparatus is collapsible in order to aid transport or storage. The apparatus is easily collapsed and erected. The base and adjustment plate mechanism provides for best alignment with a given pet door, in a basic fashion. The weighted transparent flexible strips provide an effective weather deterrent while also encouraging pet use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Comfort material on the interior base provides warmth and comfort. The apparatus is available in various sizes to accommodate an individual pet's needs. Plastics and other synthetic materials are used for lightweight and for inexpensive production and sale. The apparatus is removably positioned independently of any other structure. An alternative embodiment substitutes a hingedly-affixed rectangular door for the flexible strips.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus has been broadly outlined the more important features of the improved pet door protection apparatus so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the pet door protection apparatus is to prevent inclement weather conditions from opening or invading a pet door.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the pet door protection apparatus is to provide collapsibility.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further object of the pet door protection apparatus is to provide for height adjustment of one end of the apparatus to align the apparatus with a structure's pet door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An added object of the pet door protection apparatus is to provide transparency for a majority of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">And, an object of the pet door protection apparatus is to reduce learning curves for a pet's use of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These together with additional objects, features and advantages of the improved pet door protection apparatus will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments of the improved pet door protection apparatus when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this respect, before explaining the current embodiments of the improved pet door protection apparatus in detail, it is to be understood that the pet door protection apparatus is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concept of this disclosure may be readily utilized as a basis for the design of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the improved pet door protection apparatus. It is therefore important that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the pet door protection apparatus. It is also to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for purposes of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> thereof, the principles and concepts of the pet door protection apparatus generally designated by the reference number <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the collapsible pet door protection apparatus <b>10</b> is for movable placement adjacent to a pet door <b>90</b>, without need of attachment of the apparatus <b>10</b> to any given structure. The apparatus <b>10</b> has a first end <b>12</b> and a second end <b>13</b>. The apparatus <b>10</b> second end <b>13</b> is open and, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is positioned closely to the pet door <b>90</b> in order to shield the pet door <b>90</b> and a pet <b>80</b> from inclement weather conditions such as wind, rain and snow, for example. Transparent side panels <b>35</b>, transparent roof panels <b>40</b>, and transparent roof end panels <b>48</b>, along with a plurality of transparent flexible strips <b>74</b> also provide shelter for a pet <b>80</b>, but also allow the pet <b>80</b> to comfortably observe outdoor activities and events. Each flexible strip <b>74</b> has a weight <b>79</b> disposed at the strip's bottom end <b>78</b> to prevent wind and snow entry into the apparatus <b>10</b> which may also cause the pet door <b>90</b> to blow open.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, and also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> further comprises the parallelepiped base <b>15</b> having a front end <b>36</b>, a rear end <b>37</b>, a right side <b>38</b>, and a left side <b>39</b>. An adjustment plate <b>17</b>, having a first side <b>42</b> and a second side <b>43</b>, is hingedly affixed to the front end <b>36</b> of the base <b>15</b> via a plate hinge <b>20</b>. A plurality of teeth <b>18</b> is disposed horizontally across the base, between the right side <b>38</b> and the left side <b>39</b>, adjacent to the rear end <b>37</b>. A parallelepiped adjuster <b>22</b> is hingedly affixed to the second side <b>43</b> of the adjustment plate <b>17</b> via an adjuster hinge <b>23</b>. The adjuster <b>22</b> is selectively pivoted via the adjuster hinge <b>23</b> and fitted into the teeth <b>18</b>, thereby selecting a height of the second side <b>43</b> of the adjustment plate <b>17</b>, thereby aligning the apparatus <b>10</b> second end <b>13</b> with a chosen pet door <b>90</b>. An interior floor <b>25</b> having a first floor side <b>26</b> and a second floor side <b>27</b> is fitted atop the adjustment plate <b>17</b>. A comfort material <b>60</b> covers the top of the interior floor <b>25</b>. The comfort material <b>60</b> may be carpet, other woven material, or some form of resilient material. A groove <b>30</b> continuously runs longitudinally along the first floor side <b>26</b> and the second floor side <b>27</b> of interior floor <b>25</b>. A side panel <b>35</b> having a proximal end <b>65</b> and a distal end <b>66</b> is removably and vertically fitted within each groove <b>30</b>. A roof panel <b>40</b> is hingedly attached to each of the side panels <b>35</b>, respectively, via panel hinges <b>50</b>. The roof panels <b>40</b> are hingedly attached to each other via panel hinges <b>50</b>. The pair of opposed triangular roof end panels <b>48</b> are vertically fitted between the roof panels <b>40</b>. The protective cap <b>55</b> is fitted atop the hinged attachment of the roof panels <b>40</b>. The cap <b>55</b> further comprises tabs <b>57</b> for holding the roof panels <b>40</b> and the roof end panels <b>48</b> in position. The strip anchor <b>70</b> is selectively fitted to the proximal end <b>65</b> of each side panel <b>35</b>. A plurality of flexible strips <b>74</b> is hung from the strip anchor <b>70</b>. The strips <b>74</b> are not attached to each other. A weight <b>79</b> is disposed at each strip bottom end <b>78</b>. The weights <b>79</b> act to maintain a breakable seal for resisting inclement weather, thereby sheltering a pet <b>80</b> and preventing weather invasion into the apparatus <b>10</b> and the pet door <b>90</b>, while also allowing a e pet <b>80</b> to easily enter and exit through the flexible strips <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the present apparatus <b>10</b> is illustrated which provides a door <b>100</b> hingedly attached via a hinge assembly <b>102</b> to the first end of the apparatus <b>10</b> to allow a pet <b>80</b> to enter and exit the apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the pet door protection apparatus, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the pet door protection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Directional terms such as &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;back&#x201d;, &#x201c;in&#x201d;, &#x201c;out&#x201d;, &#x201c;downward&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, and the like may have been used in the description. These terms are applicable to the embodiments shown and described in conjunction with the drawings. These terms are merely used for the purpose of description in connection with the drawings and do not necessarily apply to the position in which the pet door protection apparatus may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the pet door protection apparatus. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the pet door protection apparatus to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the pet door protection apparatus.</p>
