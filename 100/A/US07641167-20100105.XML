<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to item holders and display devices and, more specifically, to portable item holders, display devices, and aromatic devices that are vacuum mounted on smooth surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">People often wish to display items, such as photos, collector cards (e.g., baseball cards), and pieces of art. They also often wish to have aromatic items in their environment. These people sometimes prefer to locate the item being displayed and/or providing aroma as conveniently as possible. Locating conventional display devices, such as picture frames, and conventional aromatic items, such as scented candle holders, on non-horizontal surfaces (e.g., walls) is often convenient because the devices can be appreciated while not taking up counter or shelf space.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">People also sometimes desire to change a location of the item being displayed and/or providing aroma. For example, a person displaying a picture on their kitchen wall may want to instead display the picture on a wall at their workplace. As another example, a person having a scented candle hanging from a candle holder secured to their bathroom wall may want to have the scented candle in another location. However, it is not easy to change the location of conventional devices that are secured to surfaces. For example, to change the display location of an item displayed in one of many conventional picture frames, the frame must be removed from a hook on which it was hanging from and a hook must be mounted on a wall at another location for holding the frame. Further, the old hook must be used for other purposes or removed, which could leave a scar in the wall and require repair and painting. Changing the location of a scented-candle holder secured to a wall, such as by a nail, presents similar challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Display devices with greater portability exist, but they have limited convenience. For example, magnetic picture frames are easily portable from one ferrous surface to another. However, such picture frames will not work where the surface is not ferrous. Further, most magnetic display devices are not aromatic. Conventional suction cups are very portable, being mountable on most smooth and non-porous surfaces. However, conventional suction cups do not have integral compartments for holding an item for displaying the item or providing a desired aroma of the item.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to the figures, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portable item holder and display device according to a first embodiment of the present invention is designated in its entirety by reference number <b>10</b>. The item holder <b>10</b> has a flexible or deformable body <b>12</b> including an outer surface <b>14</b>, an inner surface <b>16</b>, and a periphery <b>18</b> extending around the body and surrounding the inner surface and the outer surface. Although the flexible body <b>12</b> may include other materials without departing from the scope of the present invention, in one embodiment the body includes a resinous thermoplastic such as polyvinyl chloride. In one embodiment, the flexible body <b>12</b> is generally visually transparent. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outer surface <b>14</b> may include a convex portion <b>20</b>. The inner surface <b>16</b> includes a concave portion <b>22</b> opposite the outer surface <b>14</b>. For embodiments in which the outer surface <b>14</b> includes the convex portion <b>20</b>, the concave portion <b>22</b> of the inner surface <b>16</b> may be opposite the convex portion. The outer surface <b>14</b> may be substantially free of protrusions such as the central knobs protruding from outer surfaces of conventional suction cups. In one embodiment, the convex portion <b>20</b> is substantially free of protrusions. The flexible body has a thickness T measured between the outer surface <b>14</b> and the inner surface <b>16</b>. The thickness T may vary throughout the flexible body <b>12</b> or be generally constant. For example, the thickness T may vary from a maximum thickness of between about 0.06 inch and about 0.25 inch in a central region <b>24</b> of the convex and/or concave portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and a minimum thickness of between about 0.002 inch and about 0.08 inch adjacent the periphery <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the flexible body <b>12</b> has a constant thickness T of between about 0.08 inch and about 0.125 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The flexible body <b>12</b> is deformable between an undeformed or default shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and an actuated shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to mount the holder <b>10</b> by suction or vacuum on a generally smooth and generally non-porous mounting surface <b>26</b>. The holder <b>10</b> may be secured to mounting surfaces <b>26</b> having various attitudes. For example, the holder <b>10</b> may be mounted on an upward facing or downward facing horizontal mounting surface <b>26</b>. The holder <b>10</b> may also be mounted on a vertical surface <b>26</b> or on a generally upward or downward facing surface that is angled between horizontal and vertical. A mounting strength of the holder <b>10</b> depends in part on the size, shape, and material of the body <b>12</b> and characteristics of the mounting surface <b>26</b>, such as smoothness and porosity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mounting surface <b>26</b> must include a surface area that is at least as large as an area the flexible body <b>12</b> spans when it is in its actuated shape. To mount the holder <b>10</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>, the inner surface <b>16</b> of the flexible body <b>12</b> is positioned adjacent the mounting surface when the body is in its default shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By positioning the flexible body <b>12</b> in this way, a cavity <b>28</b> is formed between the body <b>12</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b>. Then the flexible body <b>12</b> is moved to its actuated shape (i.e., causing the inner surface <b>16</b> to conform to the mounting surface), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, thereby sealing the body against the mounting surface <b>26</b> and forcing fluid such as air out of the cavity <b>28</b> to create the suction between the body and the mounting surface. The suction created within the sealed cavity secures the body <b>12</b> to the mounting surface <b>26</b>. As the flexible body <b>12</b> is deformed toward the actuated shape, reflex or spring forces are created in the body between the convex and concave portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> that act to return the body to its default shape. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the flexible body <b>12</b> must be sized and shaped so forces created by the suction balance with or are greater than the sum of the reflex forces created in the body and any loading on the body to create and maintain the connection between the body and mounting surface <b>26</b>. To demount the body <b>12</b> from the mounting surface, the user moves the body out of its actuated shape thereby breaking the seal and suction. For example, the user may pull or otherwise move a portion of the periphery <b>18</b> to break the suction and seal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The flexible body <b>12</b> further includes a compartment <b>30</b> extending through the body between the outer surface <b>14</b> and the inner surface <b>16</b> of the body for holding an item <b>32</b> during use of the holder <b>10</b>. The item <b>32</b> may be part of the holder <b>10</b> or used in combination with the holder. The compartment <b>30</b> has an opening <b>34</b> for accessing the compartment. The compartment <b>30</b> and opening <b>34</b> may be sized and shaped in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>10</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the compartment <b>30</b> may have a generally constant width W<sub>C </sub>and a generally constant height H<sub>C</sub>. The opening <b>34</b> may have a width that is the same as the compartment width W<sub>C</sub>. In one embodiment, the compartment width Wc is between about 22% and about 95% of a width W<sub>B </sub>of the flexible body <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the compartment height H<sub>C </sub>is between about 17% and about 95% of a height H<sub>B </sub>of the body <b>12</b>. For example, in a particular embodiment, the compartment <b>30</b> has a width W<sub>C </sub>of between about 2 inches and about 8.5 inches and a height H<sub>C </sub>of between about 2 inches and about 11 inches and the body <b>12</b> has a width W<sub>B </sub>of between about 2.5 inches and about 9 inches and a height H<sub>B </sub>of between about 2.5 inches and about 11.5 inches. The compartment <b>30</b> may be sized and shaped to receive all of the item <b>32</b> so that it does not protrude from the opening <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The compartment <b>30</b> and opening <b>34</b> may be located in a variety of positions without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>10</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained as described above. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the opening <b>34</b> may be located adjacent the periphery <b>18</b>. In another embodiment (not shown), the opening <b>34</b> is located at a portion of the outer surface <b>14</b> that is spaced from the periphery <b>18</b>. The compartment <b>30</b> is separated from the outer surface <b>14</b> by an outer distance D<sub>O</sub>, from the inner surface by an inner distance D<sub>I</sub>, and from the periphery <b>18</b> by a maximum lateral distance D<sub>L</sub>. In one embodiment (not shown), the compartment <b>30</b> is equidistant from the outer surface <b>14</b> and the inner surface <b>16</b> (i.e., D<sub>O</sub>=D<sub>I</sub>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the compartment <b>30</b> being located closer to the outer surface <b>14</b> than to the inner surface <b>16</b> (i.e., D<sub>O</sub>&#x3c;D<sub>I</sub>). In one embodiment, the distance D<sub>O </sub>between the compartment <b>30</b> and the outer surface <b>14</b> is between about 0.001 inch and about 0.05 inch and the distance D<sub>I </sub>between the compartment and the inner surface <b>16</b> is between about 0.001 inch and about 0.05 inch. In one embodiment, the maximum distance D<sub>L </sub>between the compartment <b>30</b> and the periphery <b>18</b> is between about 0.125 inch and about 0.25 inch. In embodiments in which the compartment <b>30</b> extends between the convex portion <b>20</b> and concave portion <b>22</b> of the body <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the compartment <b>30</b> may extend generally parallel to both portions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The periphery <b>18</b> of the flexible body <b>12</b> may have various sizes and shapes without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>10</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained as described above. For some periphery <b>18</b> shapes, the reflex forces in the body <b>12</b> must be reduced in places to ensure secure mounting of the holder <b>10</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>. One way to reduce reflex forces is by selectively changing body <b>12</b> thickness T. For example, the thickness T of the flexible body <b>12</b> may taper from a maximum thickness adjacent the central region <b>24</b> of the convex and concave portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to a minimum thickness adjacent the periphery <b>18</b>, as described above, to reduce reflex forces.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is contemplated that reflex forces can also be reduced by varying the material or material properties of the flexible body <b>12</b> between the central region <b>24</b> and the periphery <b>18</b>. Another way to reduce reflex forces in the body <b>12</b> is to make the body to have a bend (not shown) between the concave portion <b>22</b> and the periphery <b>18</b> so the inner surface <b>16</b> of the body turns away from the mounting surface <b>26</b> when the holder is positioned adjacent to the mounting surface. Yet another way to reduce reflex forces in the body <b>12</b> is to change the configuration of the body by adjusting the inner distance D<sub>I</sub>, the outer distance D<sub>O</sub>, and/or an internal size of the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of the holder <b>10</b> in which the periphery <b>18</b> is generally rectangular. The periphery <b>18</b> may be symmetric, such as circular, square, or oval, or non-symmetric. In one embodiment, the periphery <b>18</b> is non-circular. Other exemplary periphery <b>18</b> shapes include those corresponding to articles of clothing such as a shirt or shoe, structures such as a house, a vehicle such as a car, boat, or airplane, and articles of natures such as a fruit, flower, tree, person, or animal. Also, the body <b>12</b> may be colored or tinted as desired. For example, a heart-shaped holder (not shown) may be tinted red and a tree-shaped holder (not shown) may be tinted green and/or brown. The body <b>12</b> may be tinted and generally transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The periphery <b>18</b>, compartment <b>30</b>, and opening <b>34</b> may have corresponding shapes, sizes, and/or locations. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the compartment <b>30</b> may be rectangular corresponding to a rectangular periphery <b>18</b>. As another example, the periphery <b>18</b> may be shaped as a mailbox (not shown) and the opening <b>34</b> to the compartment <b>30</b> may be located at an end of the mailbox shape corresponding to a door of the mailbox. As yet another example, in an embodiment of the body <b>12</b> having an opening <b>32</b> spaced from the periphery <b>18</b> (not shown), the periphery <b>18</b> is shaped as a kangaroo and the opening <b>34</b> is located and sized to correspond to a pouch of the kangaroo.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A user of the holder <b>10</b> may selectively position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b> through the opening <b>34</b> and remove the item from the compartment through the opening. For embodiments of the holder <b>10</b> having a generally transparent body <b>12</b>, the user may display the item <b>32</b> in the holder for viewing through the body. Various items <b>32</b> may be part of or used in combination with the holder <b>10</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the item does not interfere with creation and maintenance of the suction between the holder <b>10</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The item <b>32</b> may have various sizes, shapes, and material characteristics (e.g., stiffness) without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the item <b>32</b> may be generally circular, rectangular, square, or oval. The item <b>32</b> may also have a shape corresponding to a shape of the periphery <b>18</b> and/or compartment <b>30</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the item <b>32</b> may be generally rectangular corresponding to a generally rectangular compartment <b>30</b> and periphery <b>18</b> or generally circular corresponding to a generally circular compartment and periphery. In some embodiments, the body <b>12</b> is configured so that positioning an overly-rigid item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b> will interfere with mounting the body on the mounting surface <b>26</b> by limiting an ability of the body to flex as needed to create sufficient suction between the body and the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The items <b>32</b> may have a predetermined or preselected size, shape, and stiffness. For example, a maker of the holder <b>10</b> may design items <b>32</b> specifically for use as part of or in combination with the holder. For example, items <b>32</b> can have a bend corresponding to a bend in the compartment <b>30</b> of the body <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the item <b>32</b> has a shape corresponding to a shape of the compartment <b>30</b> or the periphery <b>18</b>. For example, the item <b>32</b> may be circular corresponding to a circular compartment <b>30</b> or square corresponding to a square compartment and periphery <b>18</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the body <b>12</b> can only be mounted on the mounting surface <b>26</b> when the item <b>32</b> is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. Accordingly, bodies <b>12</b> can be less stiff and/or have a smaller thickness T corresponding to a stiffness that items <b>32</b> having a predetermined stiffness will add to the body when the item is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. In those embodiments, the item <b>32</b> adds stiffness to the body <b>12</b> needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface <b>26</b>. When a body <b>12</b> of these embodiments is pushed against the mounting surface <b>26</b>, as described above, when it does not have an item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b>, the body will have insufficient stiffness to create the suction forces needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface. On the other hand, when an item <b>32</b> having a stiffness within a range of predetermined or desired stiffnesses is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b> of a body <b>12</b> according to these embodiments, the body has sufficient stiffness to create the suction forces needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface. For example, in a particular embodiment, the range of predetermined stiffnesses include a stiffness of standard collector cards such as baseball, hockey, or other themed cards. Thus, the body <b>12</b> in this embodiment would only be mountable on the mounting surface when a collector card or other item <b>32</b> having a stiffness within the predetermined range is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the body <b>12</b> is mountable on the mounting surface <b>26</b> regardless of whether an item <b>32</b> is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b> or the compartment is empty. During use of holders <b>10</b> according to this embodiment, the user may position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b>, mount the body <b>12</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>, remove the item from the compartment, and demount the body from the mounting surface in any order. For example, a user may position an item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b>, then mount the body <b>12</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>, then remove the item from the compartment while the body is mounted on the mounting surface, and then position the same or another item in the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The item <b>32</b> may display a variety of information without departing from the scope of the present invention. The item <b>32</b> may display information about, for example, a famous person, a movie, or a business. In one embodiment, the item <b>32</b> is partially transparent or partially translucent. In this embodiment, information displayed on the item <b>32</b> will stand out when the item is positioned in the compartment and the body <b>12</b> is generally transparent. The item <b>32</b> may also have information such as drawings and/or words on both sides. For example, conventional sports-themed trading cards such as baseball cards include a picture of a particular player and the name and position of the player on a front of the card and player statistics on a back of the card. When such an item <b>32</b> is positioned in a generally transparent holder body <b>12</b>, the information on the sides of the item can be viewed through the outer surface <b>14</b> and inner surface, respectively. When such an item <b>32</b> is then mounted on a generally transparent mounting surface <b>26</b> such as a window, the information on a side of the item positioned adjacent the outer surface <b>14</b> can be viewed through the outer surface and the information on the other side of the item can be viewed through the inner surface <b>16</b> and the transparent mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The periphery <b>18</b> of the body <b>12</b> may have a shape corresponding to that which the item <b>32</b> displays. For example, the periphery <b>18</b> may be shaped as a football and the compartment <b>30</b> may be sized and shaped to hold traditional or custom-shaped football trading/collector cards. As another example, the periphery <b>18</b> may be shaped as an apple and a user may position an item <b>32</b> including an advertisement for a dentist or other doctor in the compartment <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The items <b>32</b> may have various purposes without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the item may display art. Another example item is an electronic pass card. For this example, a highway authority may provide holders <b>10</b> to regular highway users for holding a pass card (not shown). The pass cards may include an element detectable by system sensors positioned along the highway to acknowledge the user has paid their fees for using the highway toll system. Such a holder may be mounted on, among other places, an inside of a vehicle window such as a front windshield. Another exemplary item <b>32</b> is an identification card such as a driver's license (not shown). The driver's license may be custom made for use with particular holders <b>10</b> such as by having a special shape and/or stiffness corresponding to shape and stiffness of the body <b>12</b>. For example, a less stiff license <b>32</b> may be used with a stiffer body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the user may position generally thin low-stiffness items <b>32</b> such as a standard piece of paper in the compartment <b>30</b>. For example, a child may draw on a small piece of paper, position it in the compartment <b>30</b>, and mount the body <b>12</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b> for displaying the drawing. The item <b>32</b> may also include a small piece of art or a photo, such as a standard wallet-sized photo. In this way, the holder <b>10</b> can be used as a portable picture frame. As other examples, the user may write a shopping list, appointment, or other reminders on a piece of paper before positioning the paper in the compartment for display by mounting the body <b>12</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment of the present invention, the item <b>32</b> includes aromatic or fragrant material. For example, the item <b>32</b> can include an aromatic fluid, such as a liquid that emits a pleasant aroma. In one embodiment, the aromatic fluid is a gel. The aromas that the item <b>32</b> may be designed to emit are not limited. Exemplary aromas include various floral aromas, fruit scents such as lemon, orange, kiwi, and grapefruit, and other common scents such as lavender, vanilla, eucalyptus, chamomile, sage, and pine. The item <b>32</b> may be designed to release a desired and predetermined or preselected aroma and may be designed to release the aroma continuously for a limited time or an unlimited time. In one embodiment, the item <b>32</b> is a fluid that diminishes, such as by evaporation, as it releases the desired aroma. In this embodiment, the user can replenish the compartment <b>30</b> with more of the same fragranced item <b>32</b> or with an item having a different fragrance. The device <b>10</b> can be sold with replenishing quantities of the aromatic item. For example, the device <b>10</b> can be packaged and sold with small containers of the same or variously fragranced replacement fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The item <b>32</b> may be an aromatic display item and the particular aroma of the item may correspond to that which the item displays. For example, the item <b>32</b> may include a theme card, similar to a traditional sports trading card, displaying butterflies in a garden and having a floral aroma. Aromatic fluids may also be used as display items. For example, the item <b>32</b> may include a fluid having a desired aroma or a desired color that can be displayed through a transparent body <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, any combination of the aroma of the item <b>32</b>, the item shape, the periphery <b>18</b> shape, and that which the item displays (e.g., the color of the item) may be related. For example, in one embodiment the periphery <b>18</b> is shaped as a banana, the body <b>12</b> is transparent or tinted or colored yellow, and the item <b>32</b> emits a banana aroma and may be yellow in color. As another example, a pine tree-shaped periphery <b>18</b> may include a green-colored fluid emitting a pine smell.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The body <b>12</b> may be configured to promote the release of aroma from fragrant items <b>32</b>. For example, the opening <b>34</b> can be shaped to allow greater release of aroma from the item <b>32</b> when it is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by designing a larger opening <b>34</b>. A larger opening <b>34</b> allows more air to pass over an exposed surface of the item <b>32</b> when it is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>, which increases the amount of aroma emitted by the item or at least ensures emission. In another embodiment, configuring the body <b>12</b> to promote the release of aroma from the item <b>32</b> when it is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b> includes making the body of a material that is porous or otherwise permeable with respect to the aroma to allow the aroma to pass from the item in the compartment and through the body to outside of the body. The body <b>12</b> may have multiple features designed to promote the release of the aroma from the item <b>32</b>. For example, the body <b>12</b> may include an opening configured to release aroma and a permeable material allowing the aroma to pass through the body.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The body <b>12</b> may include scented material. For example, the body <b>12</b> may be made of a plastic material that has been impregnated with a gel, an oil, or pellets that render the body <b>12</b> scented as desired. Possible scents include but are not limited to those described above regarding the item <b>32</b>. In one particular embodiment (not shown in detail), the body <b>12</b> is made of a scented material and does not include a compartment <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the holder <b>10</b> can hold a scented material as the item <b>32</b> (e.g., which can be impregnated into the body) without use of a compartment <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the holder <b>10</b> may include a message <b>36</b> displayed on the outer surface <b>14</b> of the flexible body <b>12</b>, on the inner surface <b>16</b> of the body, and/or between them. Various types of messages <b>36</b> may be displayed on or in the flexible body <b>12</b> for various reasons without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, words, logos, and/or art may be displayed on or in the flexible body <b>12</b> for aesthetic and/or communication purposes. The message <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes multiple baseballs. The message <b>36</b> may be secured to or formed in the body <b>12</b> in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the message <b>36</b> may be printed on the outer surface <b>14</b> or inner surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>12</b>. The message <b>36</b> may also be printed on a label adhered to the outer surface <b>14</b> and the label may be fully or partially opaque, translucent, and/or transparent as desired. It is contemplated that the message <b>36</b> may be formed using material of the flexible body <b>12</b> by, for example, molding, melting, etching, or engraving the message into the outer surface <b>14</b> of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The message <b>36</b> may be colored as desired and, as described above, the flexible body <b>12</b> may be colored or tinted as desired. The shape of the body <b>12</b>, the color of the body, the message <b>36</b>, and the color of the message may be selected to relate to each other as desired. For example, in one embodiment (not shown), a golf ball inspired holder has a generally circular periphery, a message including actual dimples or a rendition of dimples printed or otherwise displayed on the outer surface of the body, and a white body. The message <b>36</b> may correspond to the item <b>32</b> expected to be positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a message <b>36</b> including baseballs corresponding to the item <b>32</b> being a baseball card. Further, the message <b>36</b> may correspond in size, shape, and/or location(s) to the item <b>32</b> expected to be positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. For example, the baseballs <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are sized and located on the body <b>12</b> so they will be positioned adjacent blank portions <b>38</b> of the baseball card <b>32</b> when the card is positioned in the compartment <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the message <b>36</b> includes a border, including flowers for example, that surrounds photos and other items <b>32</b> positioned within the compartment <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The message <b>36</b> may also correspond to any or all of the aroma of the item <b>32</b>, the shape of the item, and the periphery <b>18</b> shape. For example, in one embodiment, the periphery <b>18</b> is shaped as an orange, the message <b>36</b> includes printed or actual dimples and may be colored or tinted orange, the item <b>32</b> is designed to emit an orange fruit aroma, and the item may be colored orange.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is contemplated that the holder <b>10</b> may include a closure (not shown) for selectively sealing the compartment <b>30</b>. As an example, the body <b>12</b> may include a zipper-type seal conventionally used to seal some plastic items (e.g., plastic bags). The zipper-type seal may be positioned adjacent the opening <b>32</b> for selectively sealing and opening the compartment <b>30</b>. The user may position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment, seal the compartment by closing the closure, and mount the body <b>12</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>. Later, as desired, the user may easily open the closure to unseal the compartment and remove the item. In some embodiments of the invention where the item <b>32</b> has a predetermined desired aroma, as described above, a user may selectively open and close the closure to control the amount of aroma emitted from the holder <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, a user may control the diminishment or evaporation of the item <b>32</b> by selectively opening and closing the compartment <b>30</b> using the closure. For example, a user can position a fragrant item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>30</b>, mount the body <b>12</b> on a hallway mirror in their home, and only open the closure when they have guests over their house, closing it after the guests leave to preserve the item for a later use.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The item holder <b>10</b> may be used in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. As described above, to use the holder <b>10</b>, a user inserts the item <b>32</b> into the compartment <b>30</b> of the flexible body <b>12</b> and mounts the holder on a generally smooth and generally non-porous mounting surface <b>26</b>. Exemplary uses of the holder <b>10</b> include storing and/or displaying items <b>32</b> on a home refrigerator or mirror. The user can also store and/or display items <b>32</b> on a smooth surface <b>26</b> at work or elsewhere. A benefit of the present invention is flexibility to relocate the holder <b>10</b> on generally any smooth and non-porous mounting surface <b>26</b> as desired. For this reason, the holder <b>10</b> is said to be portable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The holder <b>10</b> may be used to hold an item <b>32</b> usable while the holder is removed from the mounting surface <b>26</b>. For example, the holder <b>10</b> can be used to hold a thin element connected to a key (not shown), which may be used to open a lock after the holder is demounted from the mounting surface <b>26</b>. In this example, the element or the key and the element may be considered the item <b>32</b>. The holder <b>10</b> may also hold an item <b>32</b> that is used for reasons other than display while the holder is secured to the mounting surface <b>26</b>. For example, in one embodiment (not shown), the holder <b>10</b> holds a thin element attached to a writing pen by a tether that is long enough to allow use of the pen on a nearby writing surface while the holder is secured to the mounting surface <b>26</b>. In this example, the holder <b>10</b> may also be configured to allow the user to store the pen in or on the holder when the pen is not being used. Using the holder <b>10</b> to hold highway pass cards, as described above, is yet another example of items <b>32</b> that can be held in the holder and used for reasons other than display.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As describe above, securing the holder <b>10</b> to the mounting surface <b>26</b> includes positioning the inner surface <b>16</b> of the flexible body <b>12</b> adjacent the mounting surface while the body is in its default shape thereby forming the cavity <b>28</b> between the body and the mounting surface. Then, the flexible body <b>12</b> is moved to its actuated shape thereby sealing the body against the mounting surface <b>26</b> and forcing fluid such as air out of the cavity <b>28</b> to create a suction between the flexible body and the mounting surface. Sealing the suction between the flexible body <b>12</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> secures the body to the mounting surface. To demount the flexible body <b>12</b> from the mounting surface <b>26</b>, for example to relocate the holder <b>10</b> on another smooth mounting surface or for using the item before remounting the holder, the body is moved out of its actuated shape thereby breaking the seal and suction. To break the seal and move the body <b>12</b> out of its actuated shape, the user may move or pull on a portion of the periphery <b>18</b>, a portion of the item <b>32</b> that may extend from the compartment <b>30</b>, or something attached to the holder <b>10</b> or the item.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an item holder <b>40</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. The holder <b>40</b> according to this embodiment has a flexible or deformable body <b>42</b> including an outer surface <b>44</b>, an inner surface <b>46</b>, and a periphery <b>48</b> extending around the body and surrounding the inner surface and the outer surface. The outer surface <b>44</b> may include a convex portion <b>50</b>. The inner surface <b>46</b> includes a concave portion <b>52</b> opposite the outer surface <b>44</b>. The outer surface <b>44</b> may be substantially free of protrusions. In one embodiment, the convex portion <b>50</b> is substantially free of protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The flexible body <b>42</b> further includes a sealed compartment <b>54</b> extending through the body between the outer surface <b>44</b> and the inner surface <b>46</b> of the body for holding the item <b>32</b> during use of the holder <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the body <b>42</b> of the holder <b>10</b> completely envelopes or surrounds the item <b>32</b>. The compartment <b>54</b> may be releasably or permanently sealed. The compartment <b>54</b> may be sealed in a variety of ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment the body <b>42</b> is molded or otherwise formed around the item. In another embodiment, the compartment <b>54</b> is formed to include an opening (similar to the opening <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the item <b>32</b> is positioned in the compartment, and then the opening is closed to seal the compartment. In this embodiment, the opening may be closed in a variety of ways, such as by using an adhesive or by welding opposite sides of the opening together.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The compartment <b>54</b> may be sized and shaped in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>10</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained during and after mounting of the body <b>42</b> on the mounting surface. In one embodiment, the compartment has a height H<sub>C </sub>that is between about 17% and about 95% of a height H<sub>B </sub>of the body <b>42</b>. For example, in a particular embodiment, the compartment height H<sub>C </sub>is between about 2 inches and about 11 inches and the body height H<sub>B </sub>is between about 2.5 inches and about 11.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The holder <b>40</b> according to this embodiment may hold and/or include any of the items <b>32</b> described above regarding other embodiments of the invention. For example, the holder <b>40</b> may hold a baseball trading card or a desired fragrant fluid. For embodiments of the holder <b>40</b> used with and/or including an item <b>32</b> having a desired aroma, the body <b>42</b> may be configured to promote the emission of the aroma, as described above regarding other embodiments. For example, the body <b>42</b> may be porous or otherwise permeable, thereby allowing the aroma from the item <b>32</b> to permeate from the item in the compartment <b>54</b> and through the body to outside of the holder <b>40</b>. The item holder <b>40</b> of this embodiment is otherwise identical to holders of earlier described embodiments and therefore will not be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an item holder <b>60</b> according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. The holder <b>60</b> according to this embodiment has a flexible or deformable body <b>62</b> including an outer surface <b>64</b>, an inner surface <b>66</b>, and a periphery <b>68</b> extending around the body and surrounding the inner surface and the outer surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the outer surface <b>64</b> may include a convex portion <b>70</b>. The inner surface <b>66</b> includes a concave portion <b>72</b> opposite the outer surface <b>64</b>. The holder <b>60</b> includes a film or sheet <b>74</b> attached to the outer surface <b>64</b> of the body <b>62</b>. The film <b>74</b> may be attached to the body <b>62</b> in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment the film <b>74</b> is welded to the body <b>62</b>. In another embodiment, the film <b>74</b> is attached to the body <b>62</b> using an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The film <b>74</b> and body <b>62</b> may form a compartment <b>76</b> between them for holding the item <b>32</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>) during use of the holder <b>60</b>. The film <b>74</b> and outer surface <b>64</b> of the body <b>62</b> may also form an opening <b>78</b> for selectively accessing the compartment <b>76</b>. The user may selectively position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>76</b> and remove the item from the compartment. The body <b>62</b>, film <b>74</b>, compartment <b>76</b>, and opening <b>78</b> may be sized and shaped in various ways without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>60</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained when mounting the body <b>62</b> on the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the compartment <b>76</b> may be generally rectangular, have a generally constant width W<sub>C</sub>, and have a generally constant height H<sub>C</sub>. The opening <b>78</b> may have a width that is about the same as the compartment width Wc. In one embodiment, the compartment width W<sub>C </sub>is between about 22% and about 95% of a width W<sub>B </sub>of the flexible body <b>62</b>. In one embodiment, the compartment height H<sub>C </sub>is between about 17% and about 95% of a height H<sub>B </sub>of the body <b>12</b>. For example, in a particular embodiment, the compartment width W<sub>C </sub>is between about 2 inches and about 8.5 inches, the compartment height H<sub>C </sub>is between about 2 inches and about 11 inches, the body width W<sub>B </sub>is between about 2.5 inches and about 9 inches, and the body height H<sub>B </sub>is between about 2.5 inches and about 11.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The compartment <b>76</b> and opening <b>78</b> may be located in a variety of positions without departing from the scope of the present invention, as long as the suction between the holder <b>60</b> and the mounting surface <b>26</b> can be created and maintained as described above. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the opening <b>78</b> may be located adjacent the periphery <b>68</b>, and in another embodiment (not shown), the opening is located at a portion of the film <b>74</b> that is spaced from the periphery <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the body <b>62</b> can only be mounted on the mounting surface <b>26</b> when the item <b>32</b> is positioned in the compartment <b>76</b>. Accordingly, bodies <b>62</b> may be less stiff and/or have a smaller thickness T corresponding to a stiffness that items <b>32</b> having a predetermined stiffness will add to the body when positioned in the compartment <b>76</b>. In these embodiments, the item <b>32</b> adds stiffness to the body <b>62</b> needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface <b>26</b>. When a body <b>62</b> of these embodiments is pushed against the mounting surface <b>26</b>, as described above, when the item is not positioned in the compartment <b>76</b>, the body will have insufficient stiffness to create the suction forces needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface. On the other hand, when an item <b>32</b> having a stiffness within a range of predetermined or desired stiffnesses is positioned in the compartment <b>76</b> of a body <b>62</b> according to these embodiments, the body has sufficient stiffness to create the suction forces needed for mounting the body on the mounting surface. For example, in a particular embodiment, the range of desired stiffnesses include a stiffness of standard trading cards such as baseball, hockey, or other themed cards. Thus, the body <b>12</b> in this embodiment would only be mountable on the mounting surface when a trading card or other item <b>32</b> having a stiffness within the desired range is positioned in the compartment <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment, the body <b>62</b> is mountable on the mounting surface <b>26</b> regardless of whether an item <b>32</b> is positioned in the compartment <b>76</b> or the compartment is empty. During use of holders <b>60</b> according to this embodiment, the user may position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>76</b>, mount the body <b>62</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>, remove the item from the compartment, and demount the body from the mounting surface in any order. For example, a user may position an item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>76</b>, then mount the body <b>62</b> on the mounting surface, then remove the item from the compartment while the body is mounted on the mounting surface, and then position the same or another item in the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is contemplated that the holder <b>60</b> may include a closure (not shown) for selectively sealing the compartment <b>76</b>. As an example, the body <b>62</b> may include a conventional zipper-type seal positioned adjacent the opening <b>78</b>. The user may position the item <b>32</b> in the compartment, seal the compartment by closing the closure, and mount the body <b>62</b> on the mounting surface <b>26</b>. Later, as desired, the user may open the closure to unseal the compartment and remove the item.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above regarding other embodiments having a closure and where the item <b>32</b> has a predetermined desired aroma, a user may selectively open and close the closure to control the amount of aroma emitted from the holder <b>60</b>. A user can also control the diminishment or evaporation of the item <b>32</b> by selectively opening and closing the compartment <b>76</b> using the closure. For example, a user can position a fragrant item <b>32</b> in the compartment <b>76</b>, mount the body <b>62</b> on a hallway mirror in their home, and only open the closure when they have guests, closing it after their guests leave to preserve the item for a later use.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The film <b>74</b> may be made of various materials without departing from the scope of the present invention.
