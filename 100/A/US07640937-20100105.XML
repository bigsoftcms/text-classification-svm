<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to nail polish removal devices and more particularly pertains to a new nail polish removal device for containing a solvent to loosen artificial nail from a hand.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of nail polish removal devices is known in the prior art. The prior art commonly teaches the use of rigid container with an absorbent material that receives a solvent and is used to dissolve nail polish or loosen artificial nails.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the need remains for a device that has certain improved features that allows for all artificial nails on a hand to be soaked at the same time thus reducing the amount of time to remove the artificial nails from the hand. Additionally, the device constricts around the wrist to inhibit odors from a solvent leaking out of the device while the artificial nails are being soaked in the solvent.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention meets the needs presented above by generally comprising a bag receiving a solvent and a hand with artificial nails thereon to allow the artificial nails to soak in the solvent and loosen the artificial nails from the hand. The bag includes a peripheral wall defining an interior space of the bag. The interior space receives the solvent and the hand. Each of a pair of complimentary fasteners is coupled to an interior surface of the peripheral wall. One of the complimentary fasteners is complimentary to the other one of the complimentary fasteners to selectively close the bag. A constriction band is coupled to the peripheral wall and positioned adjacent to the complimentary fasteners. The constriction band constricts around a wrist to inhibit odors from the solvent exiting the interior space when the hand is positioned in the interior space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> thereof, a new nail polish removal device embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the artificial nail removal container <b>10</b> generally comprises a bag <b>12</b> receiving a solvent <b>1</b> and a hand <b>2</b> with artificial nails <b>3</b> thereon to allow the artificial nails <b>3</b> to soak in the solvent <b>1</b> and loosen the artificial nails <b>3</b> from the hand <b>2</b>. The bag <b>12</b> includes a peripheral wall <b>14</b> defining an interior space <b>16</b> of the bag <b>12</b>. The interior space <b>16</b> receives the solvent <b>1</b> and the hand <b>2</b>. A top edge <b>18</b> of the peripheral wall <b>14</b> defines an upper open end <b>20</b> to permit the hand <b>2</b> and the solvent <b>1</b> to be placed in the interior space <b>16</b>. The bag <b>12</b> has fill indicia <b>22</b> positioned on an exterior surface <b>24</b> of the peripheral wall <b>14</b> to indicate a level to which the interior space <b>16</b> is to be filled with the solvent <b>1</b>. The bag <b>12</b> is comprised of transparent material to permit viewing of the hand <b>2</b> and the solvent <b>1</b> in the bag <b>12</b>. The transparent material is flexible and impermeable to the solvent <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of a pair of complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> is coupled to an interior surface <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>14</b> adjacent the top edge <b>18</b> of the peripheral wall <b>14</b>. One of the complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> is positioned opposite the other one of the complimentary fasteners <b>26</b>. One of the complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> is complimentary to the other one of the complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> to selectively close the upper open end <b>20</b> and inhibit leakage of the solvent <b>1</b> from the interior space <b>16</b>. The complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> are separable to permit opening of the upper open end <b>20</b> and gain access to the interior space <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A constriction band <b>30</b> is coupled to the peripheral wall <b>14</b> and positioned adjacent to the complimentary fasteners <b>26</b>. The constriction band <b>30</b> extends around a circumference of the peripheral wall <b>14</b>. The constriction band <b>30</b> constricts around a wrist to inhibit odors from the solvent <b>1</b> exiting the interior space <b>16</b> when the hand <b>2</b> is positioned in the interior space <b>16</b>. The constriction is comprised of an elastomeric material to permit a diameter of the constriction band <b>30</b> to change to accommodate hands <b>2</b> and wrists of various sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In use, the solvent <b>1</b> is poured into the interior space <b>16</b> of the bag <b>12</b> to the fill indicia <b>22</b>. The hand <b>2</b> is then placed into the interior space <b>16</b> with the artificial nails <b>3</b> positioned in the solvent <b>1</b>. The constriction band <b>30</b> constricts around the wrist to inhibit odors from the solvent <b>1</b> from escaping the bag <b>12</b>. Once the solvent <b>1</b> has loosened the artificial nails <b>3</b>, the hand <b>2</b> is removed from the interior space <b>16</b>. The complimentary fasteners <b>26</b> are engaged to close the upper open end <b>20</b> and permit ready disposal of the bag <b>12</b> and the solvent <b>1</b> in the bag <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
