<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related to seedbed conditioning tillage tools and more specifically to vertical tillage tools.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To prepare a seed bed for planting, many types of tilling tools have been developed. Currently, the most commonly used tilling tools include cultivators and combination tillage units that include soil engaging components (i.e., disks, tillage tines, etc.) that completely sweep (i.e., smears) an entire tillage floor to turn over and loosen all of the top soil that covers a field. For example, some tillage systems may include two rows of disks arranged such that the disks essentially completely turn over all top soil in a field. To this end, the disks are designed to have characteristics and are juxtaposed with respect to each other and a travel direction such that all of the soil is turned. Typically, to turn all soil via disks, each disk is relatively deeply concave and is inclined at a relatively steep angle with respect to the travel direction. In addition to loosening top soil, these types of tilling tools also have an advantageous leveling effect on soil as they are pulled through a field. Here, level soil is important to minimize bounce of planter assemblies that are subsequently used in a field so that seed depth can be relatively accurately controlled. Unfortunately, while these types of tilling tools loosen or till top soil well, these types of tools tend to compact under soil (i.e., soil below the top soil) as portions of the soil engaging components smear across the under soil during travel. More specifically, when a deep dish disk is inclined relatively steeply to a travel direction, the backside of the disk tends to smear and compress soil therebelow. When under soil is smeared, the density of the under soil increases and root growth is inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To reduce the smearing effect, rotary spike harrows have been developed that, as the label implies, include rotary spike toothed members that are mounted to a harrow axle and that generally rotate about a horizontal harrow axis substantially normal to or on a slight incline (e.g., 15&#xb0;-35&#xb0;) with respect to a travel direction. Here, the spikes of each toothed member penetrate soil by being driven substantially vertically downward and disrupt the soil as the spike angle within the soil changes during member rotation. The end result is tillage with less smearing effect (slight smearing still results in some applications).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While rotary spike harrows reduce smearing/soil compaction, unfortunately these types of tilling tools have several shortcomings. First, rotary spike toothed harrows usually include a relatively large number of toothed members arranged on an axle so that the weight of the tilling implement is distributed over a large number of member teeth and the spikes do not, under typical soil conditions, penetrate the soil being tilled to a desired level during a single pass. Second, rotary spike toothed harrows do not level soil to the same extent as other types of tilling tools during a single pass through a field. Here, the shortcomings of the spike toothed harrows can be overcome by increasing the number of passes through a field (e.g., 3 passes instead of a single pass). Obviously additional passes require additional time and thus are not desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, it would be advantageous to have a tilling tool or assembly that could adequately till a field in a single pass while minimizing smearing and soil compaction.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals correspond to similar elements throughout the several view and, more specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention will be described in the context of an exemplary work vehicle <b>12</b> having a vehicle support structure to which a plurality of wheels <b>26</b> are rotatably mounted. A work vehicle <b>12</b> typically has a power source coupled to a transmission with the transmission operatively coupled to at least two of the wheels <b>26</b>. The power source can be an internal combustion engine such as a gasoline engine or a diesel engine and it may also be an electric motor or a steam driven turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tillage assembly <b>10</b> is illustrated which is linked to tractor <b>12</b> by a tow bar <b>16</b>. In addition to tow bar <b>16</b>, tillage assembly <b>10</b> includes a main frame <b>14</b>, wheels, one subassembly of wheels identified by numeral <b>24</b>, first through forth disk subassemblies <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, <b>32</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>d </i>and first and second rotary spiked tooth harrows <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Frame <b>14</b> includes a plurality of rigid steel members that are welded or otherwise mechanically secured together to form a rectilinear frame assembly as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A frame axis <b>15</b> that is perpendicular to a travel direction <b>50</b> is shown twice in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. While frame axis <b>15</b> are parallel to frame members in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> embodiment, axis <b>15</b> need not be parallel to any frame members in other embodiments where frame members are not perpendicular to the travel direction <b>50</b>. Tow bar <b>16</b> extends forward from frame <b>14</b> to mount assembly <b>14</b> to tractor <b>12</b> as illustrated. Wheels <b>24</b> are mounted to and extend down from main frame <b>14</b> to support frame <b>14</b> above soil in a field through which tillage assembly <b>10</b> is pulled by tractor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for the purposes of the present invention, each of the disk subassemblies <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, <b>32</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>d </i>have similar constructions and operate in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only subassembly <b>32</b><i>a </i>will be described in any detail. Subassembly <b>32</b><i>a </i>includes, among other components, an implement mounting bar <b>18</b>, a plurality of disks, two of which are collectively identified by numeral <b>30</b> in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, and some type of adjusting mechanism (e.g., a hydraulic cylinder <b>60</b>, turn buckle, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In at least one embodiment, as illustrated best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each of the disk members <b>30</b> include a concave disk that forms outwardly extending teeth <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, etc., on its circumferential edge. Each of the teeth <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>are identical and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only tooth <b>40</b><i>a </i>will be described here in detail. As shown, tooth <b>40</b><i>a </i>is a saw blade type tooth and, to that end, includes a concave leading edge <b>44</b>, a convex following edge <b>48</b> and a lateral edge <b>46</b> that extends from the leading edge <b>44</b> to the following edge <b>48</b>, the lateral edge <b>46</b> and following edge <b>48</b> forming a tooth point (not labeled). Each two adjacent teeth <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, etc., are separated by a gap or space (e.g., <b>42</b>). Each disk <b>30</b> forms one or more generally centrally located mounting openings <b>38</b>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each disk <b>30</b> has first and second oppositely facing surfaces <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, respectively. Surface <b>31</b> is convex while surface <b>33</b> is concave where each of the surfaces <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> has a similar radius of curvature R. Exemplary disk <b>30</b> has a diameter dimension D<sub>i </sub>and a depth dimension D<sub>e </sub>as illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned above, each tooth (<b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, etc.) includes a concave leading edge <b>44</b>, a convex following edge <b>48</b> and a lateral edge <b>46</b> that extends from the leading edge <b>44</b> to the following edge <b>48</b>. As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the teeth further include a rearward pitch, or slant, <b>94</b> angled toward the following convex edge <b>48</b>. Rearward pitch <b>94</b> is the slant of the tooth as measured by the angle between 1) a radial extension <b>96</b> through disk center point <b>98</b> and the center <b>100</b> of the base of a corresponding tooth, and 2) the centerline <b>102</b> of the tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, disks <b>30</b> are mounted to implement mounting bar <b>18</b> such that the disks are aligned for rotation about a common disk axis <b>19</b> that is generally parallel to the length of bar <b>18</b>. Thus, each disk is mounted so as to be generally perpendicular to bar <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, bar <b>18</b> mounts below frame <b>14</b> such that disks <b>30</b> extend downward below main frame assembly <b>14</b> and engage soil therebelow. In this regard, a first end <b>51</b> of bar <b>18</b> is pivotally mounted to frame <b>14</b> and a second end <b>53</b> of bar <b>18</b> is journalled in a slot forming member <b>55</b> to slide therealong as bar <b>18</b> pivots about first end <b>51</b>. Adjusting mechanism <b>60</b> includes a first end mounted to frame <b>14</b> and a second end mounted to a central portion of bar <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When bar <b>18</b> is mounted to frame <b>14</b>, bar <b>18</b> is juxtaposed so that bar <b>18</b> and disk axis <b>19</b> form an angle &#x3b1; with respect to frame axis <b>15</b>. When bar <b>18</b> is angled, disks <b>30</b> are inclined at a similar angle &#x3b1; with respect to travel direction <b>50</b>. When so inclined, the second surfaces <b>33</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of disks <b>30</b> generally open in the direction of travel <b>50</b>. To adjust angle &#x3b1; between bar <b>18</b> and frame axis <b>15</b>, cylinder <b>60</b> is manipulated. When cylinder <b>60</b> is extended, angle &#x3b1; is increased and, when cylinder <b>60</b> is retracted, angle &#x3b1; is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as assembly <b>10</b> is moved through a field, disks <b>30</b> engage soil therebelow and form grooves, two of which are collectively identified by numeral <b>69</b>. As described in greater detail below, disks <b>30</b> are selected such that their dimensions and characteristics and their spacing along bar <b>18</b> result in grooves <b>52</b> that are separated by loosened/disturbed soil bands (e.g., <b>71</b>) therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, in most applications, disk subassemblies <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>will be mounted to frame assembly <b>14</b> such that the component mounting bar members (e.g., <b>18</b>) form similar angles a with respect to the frame axis <b>15</b>. Similarly, each of disk subassemblies <b>32</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>d </i>are mounted to frame assembly <b>14</b> so as to form angles a, albeit where the angles formed by subassemblies <b>32</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>d </i>with respect to frame axis <b>15</b> are in the opposite direction (e.g., where angle &#x3b1; of subassembly <b>32</b><i>a </i>is &#x2212;7&#xb0;, angle &#x3b1; of subassembly <b>32</b><i>c </i>and <b>32</b><i>d </i>will be approximately +7&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, harrows <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are similar and operate in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>will be described here in detail. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>is a rotary spike toothed harrow that is mounted below frame assembly <b>14</b> and behind disk subassemblies <b>30</b> along the travel or advancing direction <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exemplary perspective view of harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>is shown where it can be seen that harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>includes multiple spike toothed members <b>90</b> arranged to rotate along a common harrow axis <b>17</b>. Harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>has a length dimension along axis <b>17</b>. Harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>can be adjusted with respect to frame axis <b>15</b> such that an angle &#x3b2; between harrow axis <b>17</b> and frame axis <b>15</b> can be modified. To this end, a second adjusting mechanism <b>62</b> (e.g., hydraulic cylinder, turn buckle, etc.) is provided between frame assembly <b>14</b> and harrow <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Construction and operation of spike toothed rotary harrows is well known in the art and therefore are not described here in detail. Here, it should suffice to say that in operation, as harrow <b>22</b><i>a </i>is pulled through a field, the spike toothed members <b>90</b> engage soil therebelow and form generally lateral grooves, three of which are collectively identified by numerals <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Here, the lateral grooves <b>70</b> form angles &#x3b2; with respect to the travel direction <b>50</b> that are similar to the angle &#x3b2; formed between harrow axis <b>17</b> and main frame axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, in at least some embodiments, disks <b>30</b> are selected to have specific characteristics and are mounted so as to engage soil therebelow in a vary specific manner that minimizes the smearing effect caused by other types of disks. To this end, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, it has been found that smearing can be reduced by selecting disks <b>30</b> that have relatively minimal depth D<sub>e </sub>dimensions and that are scalloped or toothed in some fashion and by mounting the disks to rotate about a disk axis (e.g., <b>19</b>) that is only slightly angled from the frame axis <b>15</b>. Here, the idea is to use the disks to initially disturb the soil to a point where a single spike toothed harrow pass will cause adequate tillage to occur while minimizing soil smearing. In effect, the disks work the soil to a generally optimal point for the harrows to work ideally while causing minimal smearing. In this regard, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, because the disks <b>30</b> have a narrow depth D<sub>e </sub>and angle &#x3b1; is minimal (e.g., 7-10&#xb0;), as the disks <b>30</b> rotate, the disks form grooves <b>69</b> with loosened bands <b>71</b> of soil therebetween. In addition, because the disks have narrow depths and are minimally inclined with respect to travel direction <b>50</b>, the disks cause reduced backside disk blade pressure which has several advantages. First, reduced or substantially eliminated backside pressure means that smearing and compaction of the soil is minimized or substantially eliminated. Second, reduced backside pressure means that the forces working against disk penetration are minimized and therefore the weight of frame <b>14</b> can be advantageously reduced as a light frame <b>14</b> can cause sufficient penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In at least one advantageous embodiment, disks <b>30</b> are selected that have diameters D<sub>i </sub>that are approximately 20 inches, that have depths D<sub>e </sub>that are approximately one-half to one and one-half inch and that have radiuses of curvature R of approximately 920 mm and the disks are mounted below frame <b>14</b> such that the inclined angle &#x3b1; of the disks with respect to the travel direction <b>50</b> is between 7 and 10 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, saw tooth type disks <b>30</b> are employed where the dimension of the portion of each gap <b>42</b> between lateral edges (e.g., see <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of adjacent teeth <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>is approximately twice the dimension of each of the lateral edges <b>46</b>. Thus, for example, where the dimension of the portion of gap <b>42</b> between adjacent lateral edges is 2.6 inches, each of the adjacent lateral edges would have a length of approximately 1.3 inches. In the illustrated embodiment disk <b>30</b> has 16 teeth. In other cases the number of teeth may vary. Here, the idea behind toothed disks is to relocate soil while minimizing the actual engagement of the disk with the soil. In the present example, 66% of the soil engaging portion of the disk is removed yet the rippled or scalloped grooves <b>69</b> (i.e., continuous grooves with depth variations therealong) in the soil are essentially continuous because soil that is engaged pushes against adjacent soil and causes the adjacent soil to breakout and loosen.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in advantageous embodiments disks <b>30</b> are juxtaposed with respect to travel direction <b>50</b> such that, as the disks engage field soil and rotate, leading tooth edges <b>44</b> are driven toward the soil followed by associated following edges <b>48</b> on common teeth (e.g., <b>40</b><i>a</i>). Here, edges <b>46</b> tend to cut through field debris well and penetrate the soil effectively while only causing minimal soil compaction when compared to non-scalloped or non-toothed type disks or saw tooth type disks where the concave edges lead the convex edges.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the disks <b>30</b> loosen the soil and form grooves <b>69</b>, rotary harrows <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, operate at angles (e.g., 45&#xb0; or more with respect to travel direction <b>50</b>) to dislodge undisturbed or loosened soil between the grooves <b>69</b>, to level loose soil and evenly distribute residue in the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the dimensions and disk axis angle range described above are believed to be particularly advantageous, it is believed that other similar dimensions and similar axis angles will cause similar effects. For instance, it is believed that the blade depth D<sub>e </sub>may, in some cases, may be in the one-half to one and one-half inch range, the diameter D<sub>i </sub>may be between 16 and 24 inches and the radius of curvature R may be between 600 and 1000 millimeters. The angle &#x3b1; may be between 5&#xb0; and 20&#xb0; depending upon disk depth and diameter dimensions. Here, the important aspect is that the combination of disk characteristics (e.g., depth, diameter, radius of curvature) and disk juxtaposition (e.g., incident angle &#x3b1; with respect to the travel direction) be selected to reduce or minimize smearing of soil below the assembly <b>10</b>. In the present case, while the disk assemblies (e.g., <b>32</b><i>a</i>) form grooves and only loosen much of the top soil, the resulting soil is suitable for a single pass of a harrow to result in effective tillage for most applications.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a notched disk <b>80</b> is illustrated that could be substituted for the saw tooth disks of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to achieve a similar result. Disk <b>80</b> includes <b>18</b> radially extending teeth <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, etc., that are separated by semi-circular recesses or gaps <b>84</b>. Here, disk <b>80</b> is concave and would be arranged in a fashion similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with the concave side opening in the travel direction <b>50</b>. Once again the depth D<sub>e </sub>of disk <b>80</b> would be minimized and the inclination angle &#x3b1; would be minimal to reduce backside pressure and hence to reduce soil smearing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims. To apprise the public of the scope of this invention, the following claims are made:</p>
