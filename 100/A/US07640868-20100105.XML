<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to furniture. More particularly, the invention relates to support stands for stereo equipment. Specifically, the invention relates to a support stand for large stereo speakers that includes a mechanism to enable the stand to move slightly back and forth in response to vibrations in the speaker and air movement adjacent the same and to isolate that movement from the floor surface upon which the stand rests, and polarize that movement to enable the speaker to move more in one direction than in another direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a sound system is being set up in a room, consideration has to be given to the positioning of various speakers in the system so that sound emitted therefrom is distributed evenly around the room. Further consideration has to be given to the height of each speaker relative to the floor. Sound quality is enhanced if it is essentially focused at the height of the listeners' ears. Consequently, it is desirable to raise speakers off the floor so that they direct sound outwardly at an appropriate height. Large speakers for audio and home entertainment systems frequently cannot be placed on stands or shelves as they are too heavy in that they sometimes weigh as much as 30 lbs. This means that the speakers may not be able to be positioned at an appropriate height to direct sound waves toward the listeners in a room. Even if a speaker can be placed on a stand, high-powered speakers, especially large low frequency bass speakers, move a considerable amount of air back and forth. This low frequency energy may generate considerable vibrations in the speaker and cause it to move forward and rearward across a surface. This migration places the speaker at risk if it is supported a distance above a floor surface. Furthermore, if the speaker cabinet is not rigidly bolted to a heavy mass or to its support, the support itself may vibrate with the speaker and possibly generate additional unwanted noise that ruins the sound quality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is therefore a need in the art for a speaker support that will adjust to the vibration and air movement created by the speaker, will substantially reduce migration of the vibrating speaker across the surface of the support, and is adjustable to allow sound emitted therefrom to be directed either upwardly or downwardly into a room.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device of the present invention comprises a stand for a stereo speaker. The stand comprises a support and a plurality of isolating and polarizing assemblies that engage the support and allow movement of the speaker relative to the support in one direction more than in another direction and to isolate that movement relative to the floor surface upon which the support rests. Preferably, the stand also includes a shelf and a plurality of rods that engage the assemblies and connect the shelf to the support. A first assembly engages a first end of each rod with the shelf and a second assembly engages the second end of each rod with the support. The assemblies are configured to permit more movement of the rods in a first horizontal direction than in a second horizontal direction. Thus, the assemblies allow the shelf to move back and forth in the first horizontal direction in response to vibrations in the speaker and air movement adjacent the same. The stand also includes a mechanism for adjusting the inclination of the shelf relative to the support so as to allow sound emitted therefrom to be directed in a particular direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, there is shown a speaker stand in accordance with the present invention and generally indicated at <b>10</b>. Speaker stand <b>10</b> comprises a shelf <b>12</b> and support <b>14</b> positioned vertically relative to each other and maintained a distance apart by a plurality of supporting rods <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Shelf <b>12</b> and support <b>14</b> preferably are made from an injection-molded ABS or styrene plastic, but may alternatively be formed from any other suitable material. Rods <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> preferably are thin aluminum pipes of equal length, although they may be made from any other suitable metal without departing from the spirit of the invention. Rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> are provided to support the weight of a speaker <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that is retained on stand <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Shelf <b>12</b> has a top wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>and side walls <b>12</b><i>b </i>which extend downwardly away therefrom. One of side walls <b>12</b><i>b </i>includes an upwardly extending lip <b>24</b> that is provided with an adhesive foam layer (not shown) thereon. Lip <b>24</b> is adapted to engage one of the walls of a speaker cabinet <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), as will be hereinafter described. Lip <b>24</b> substantially prevents the speaker <b>25</b> from sliding off top wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>of shelf <b>12</b>. Shelf <b>12</b> is molded with four projections <b>26</b> proximate the corners thereof. Projections <b>26</b> define hexagonally shaped first apertures <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) therein. An annular rim <b>29</b> extends into each first aperture <b>28</b> proximate a bottom end <b>26</b><i>a </i>of projection <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Support <b>14</b> has a top wall <b>14</b><i>a </i>and side walls <b>14</b><i>b </i>that extend downwardly away therefrom. Support <b>14</b> is molded with four projections <b>32</b> proximate its corners. Projections <b>32</b> each define hexagonally shaped second apertures <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 and 6</figref>) therein and each projection <b>32</b> is vertically alignable with one of projections <b>26</b> on shelf <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each projection <b>32</b> includes an annular rim <b>38</b> that extends for a distance inwardly into each second aperture <b>34</b> proximate a top end of projection <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with a specific feature of the present invention, a plurality of isolating and polarizing assemblies <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> are provided on stand <b>10</b>. Preferably, a plurality of first assemblies <b>30</b> are engaged with shelf <b>12</b> and a plurality of second assemblies <b>36</b> are engaged with support <b>14</b>. The assemblies are provided to permit movement of shelf <b>12</b> relative to support <b>14</b> in response to air movement adjacent speaker <b>25</b>. The assemblies permit movement of speaker <b>25</b> but isolate that movement from floor surface <b>100</b>. The assemblies further polarize the movement of speaker <b>25</b> relative to support <b>14</b> so that movement is permitted more in one direction than in another direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with a specific feature of the present invention, the first and second assemblies are resilient bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> that are snap fitted into the respective one of first and second apertures <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> and retain rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> therebetween. Bushings <b>36</b> will be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, but it should be understood that bushings <b>30</b> are substantially identical to bushings <b>36</b> and are used in the same manner and for the same purpose. Each bushing <b>36</b> is an integrally formed, injection molded, rubber component. Bushing <b>36</b> has a hexagonally-shaped body <b>40</b> and a double annular flange <b>42</b> that extend vertically outwardly away from body <b>40</b>. A shoulder <b>44</b> is formed at the transition between body <b>40</b> and flange <b>42</b>. Body <b>40</b> is complementary in shape and size to second aperture <b>34</b> in projection <b>32</b> of support <b>14</b>. Bushing <b>36</b> is snap-fitted into second aperture <b>34</b> and can only be received therein when the complementary hexagonal shapes of bushing <b>36</b> and second aperture <b>34</b> are aligned. A shallow depression <b>48</b> is provided in the end of body <b>40</b> opposite to flange <b>42</b>. Depression <b>48</b> allows body <b>40</b> to flex slightly as bushing <b>36</b> is engaged in second aperture <b>34</b>. When bushing <b>36</b> is snap-fitted into second aperture <b>34</b>, the flange <b>42</b> thereof is inserted first into second aperture <b>34</b> and bushing is pushed upwardly until shoulder <b>44</b> engages rim <b>38</b>. At this point, flange <b>42</b> extends upwardly beyond top wall <b>14</b><i>a </i>of support <b>14</b> and an end portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>of body <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) extends outwardly below bottom end <b>32</b><i>a </i>of projection <b>32</b>. End portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>is adapted to abut the floor surface <b>100</b> upon which stand <b>10</b> rests and stand <b>10</b> therefore effectively is supported on end portions <b>40</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Bushings <b>30</b>, on the other hand, are inserted into shelf <b>12</b> in exactly the opposite orientation. The shoulder (not numbered) of bushing <b>30</b> engages rim <b>29</b> of projection <b>26</b>. Flange portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>thereof extends downwardly beyond bottom end <b>26</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of projection <b>26</b> and end portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>of bushing <b>30</b> extends upwardly away from top wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>of shelf <b>12</b>. Consequently, a larger speaker <b>25</b> may not rest directly on shelf <b>12</b> but may instead rest on end portions <b>30</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with another specific feature of the present invention, each bushing <b>36</b> is provided with a longitudinal bore <b>46</b> that extends from flange <b>42</b> into the interior of body <b>40</b>. Bore <b>46</b> does not extend entirely through body <b>40</b> and terminates a distance inwardly from depression <b>48</b>. A first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bore <b>46</b> is substantially oval in cross-sectional shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). A second section <b>46</b><i>b </i>of bore <b>46</b> extends inwardly from this oval-shaped first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>and is generally cylindrical in cross-sectional shape. Bore <b>46</b> is provided to receive and retain an end of one of rods <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> therein. Second section <b>46</b><i>b </i>is configured so as to be complementary to the end of one of the rods, such as rod <b>20</b>. Consequently, the end of rod <b>20</b> is tightly retained in second section <b>46</b><i>b</i>. First section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bore <b>46</b> is not complementary to the external shape of rod <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bore <b>46</b> has a width &#x201c;C&#x201d; that is substantially equal to the diameter of rod <b>20</b>. First section <b>46</b><i>a </i>has a length &#x201c;D&#x201d; that is substantially longer than the diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d; of rod <b>20</b>. Thus, rod <b>20</b> is able to move to a limited degree back and forth in a direction parallel to the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; axis of bushing <b>36</b>, but can move considerably more from side to side in a direction parallel to the &#x201c;X&#x201d; axis of bushing <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above characteristic features of bushings <b>30</b> and <b>36</b> provide a mechanism to permit some forward and rearward movement of a portion of stand <b>10</b> in response to vibrations in speaker <b>25</b> as well as the movement of air adjacent speaker <b>25</b>, while isolating that movement from floor surface <b>100</b>. Specifically, bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> enable shelf <b>12</b> to move forward and backward relative to support <b>14</b> as air moves adjacent speaker <b>25</b>. This movement is both in response to and in unison with the air movement. Bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b>, however, polarize this movement so that shelf <b>12</b> can move backward and forward but is limited in moving side-to-side. This creates a more stable base for speaker <b>25</b>. The polarizing ability is enabled because body <b>40</b> of bushing <b>36</b> is hexagonal in shape and can therefore only engage in second aperture <b>34</b> in one of several specific orientations. The actual orientation of bushing <b>36</b> can be preselected to permit rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> and therefore shelf <b>12</b>, to move more in a first particular direction than in a second direction. The orientation of the length and width of first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>36</b> is specifically selected to allow movement in the first direction and limit movement in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. In these figures, air moves adjacent the speaker <b>25</b> in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, each bushing <b>36</b> has been oriented within second aperture <b>34</b> so that the length of first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>thereof is aligned with the direction &#x201c;S&#x201d; and the width thereof is aligned with the direction &#x201c;T&#x201d;. The length of each first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>is greater than the diameter of the associated rod <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> retained therein. The size difference permits some movement of rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> within bores <b>46</b> in a direction substantially parallel to direction &#x201c;S&#x201d;. Furthermore, the flaring shape of first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>and the tight retention of the ends of rods within second sections <b>46</b><i>b </i>of bores <b>46</b>, causes the back and forth movement of rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> to also have an arcuate component. This allows shelf <b>12</b> to move back and forth in the direction &#x201c;S&#x201d; relative to support <b>14</b>. Support <b>14</b> remains in a fixed position on surface <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the predominant direction of movement of shelf <b>12</b> is the same direction as air moving inwardly and outwardly relative to speaker <b>25</b>. Additionally, the width of first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>36</b> is substantially equal to the diameter of the rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. Consequently, movement of rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> in a side-to-side motion in the direction of arrow &#x201c;T&#x201d; is considerably reduced. Bushings <b>36</b> thereby essentially dampen motion in a direction &#x201c;T&#x201d; while allowing motion in the direction &#x201c;S&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, illustrates a situation where bushings <b>36</b> are oriented so that the lengths of first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bores <b>46</b> are oriented with their &#x201c;X&#x201d; axes aligned with direction &#x201c;T&#x201d;, and the widths thereof are aligned with direction &#x201c;S&#x201d;. This orientation of bushings <b>36</b> would permit shelf <b>12</b> to rock side-to-side relative to support <b>14</b>, if air movement was aligned with direction &#x201c;T&#x201d; and would limit back and forth movement in response to air movement relative to speaker <b>25</b>. If air movement is aligned with direction &#x201c;S&#x201d;, stand <b>10</b> might be unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-14</figref>, stand <b>10</b> is used in the following manner to support a speaker <b>25</b>. Speaker <b>25</b> is shown supported on stand <b>10</b> and preferably resting on end portions <b>30</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>30</b>. It will be understood that speaker <b>25</b> may rest entirely on end portions <b>30</b><i>a</i>, or at least partially on end portions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and shelf <b>12</b>, or entirely on shelf <b>12</b>. Stand <b>10</b>, itself, is illustrated as supported on surface <b>100</b> by resting on end portions <b>40</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>36</b>. Lip <b>24</b> of stand <b>10</b> is shown abutting a front wall <b>25</b><i>a </i>of speaker <b>25</b> so that when speaker <b>25</b> moves forward and rearward in response to the air movement adjacent speaker <b>25</b>, the speaker does not drop forwardly off stand <b>10</b> and the vibrations and movement are not transmitted to floor surface <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref> show the position of the relevant components of stand <b>10</b> when the speaker is emitting sound through front wall <b>25</b><i>a</i>. As speaker <b>25</b> vibrates and air is forced outwardly away from front wall <b>25</b><i>a </i>in the direction of arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), an equal and opposite reactionary force is brought to bear on shelf <b>12</b>. Because of the orientation of bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> and the difference in dimension between rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> and first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bores <b>46</b>, shelf <b>12</b> is able to moves rearwardly in the opposite direction to arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d; in response to this reactionary force. Thus, shelf <b>12</b> moves from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. When the vibratory and air movement is reversed and is in the opposite direction to &#x201c;S&#x201d;, shelf <b>12</b> is caused to move in the direction of arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d; and returns to its original position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or even beyond that position (not shown). The vibrations of speaker <b>25</b> and air movement relative thereto, switches again to the direction of arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d; causing shelf <b>12</b> to move back to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Shelf <b>12</b> therefore slides back and forth in response to the speaker vibrations and air movement relative to speaker <b>25</b>. Shelf <b>12</b> remains horizontally positioned relative to support <b>14</b> during all of this movement and the rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> angle slightly rearwardly and then slightly forwardly to enable this movement. This occurs because rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> are able to move slightly within the first sections <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when rod <b>22</b> moves, end portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>of bushing <b>36</b> remains firmly in contact with floor surface <b>100</b> and rod <b>20</b> moves off vertical within bore <b>46</b>. Shelf <b>12</b> and support <b>14</b> stay substantially parallel to floor surface <b>100</b> even though there is a vertical shift in rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). As discussed above, very little side-to-side motion in the direction of arrow &#x201c;T&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) can occur, so shelf <b>12</b> and support <b>14</b> are horizontally stable, just moving a small distance back and forth to essentially absorb the vibrations from speaker <b>25</b>. Furthermore, because speaker <b>25</b> is resting directly on bushings <b>30</b> and does not physically contact shelf <b>12</b>, no vibrations are transmitted directly to the shelf <b>12</b> and therefore no unwanted noise is generated by setting up a vibration in shelf <b>12</b>. As the speaker <b>25</b> vibrates and moves air relative thereto, speaker <b>25</b> can effectively float back and forth (arrow &#x201c;S&#x201d;&#x2014;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) on shelf <b>12</b> while remaining relatively stable in the side to side direction (arrow &#x201c;T&#x201d;&#x2014;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). If the speaker <b>25</b> was allowed to move in both the forward-and-back and side-to-side directions, the speaker <b>25</b> would likely be unstable on the stand <b>10</b> and would perhaps move in a circle with oscillations. The stand <b>10</b> would then not provide adequate security for supporting a heavy speaker <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be understood that if it is preferably for stand <b>10</b> to move slightly from side to side in the direction of arrow &#x201c;T&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>); then bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> will be oriented in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Stand <b>12</b> will then be caused to sway slightly from side to side because rods <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> will move from side to side in the differently oriented bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b>. Furthermore, stand <b>10</b> may be rotated in any needed direction to position lip <b>24</b> at an appropriate spot to substantially prevent speaker <b>25</b> from being vibrated off the same.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some instances, it is desirable to be able to direct sound emitted from the speaker <b>25</b> either upwardly or downwardly relative thereto. For instance, if a living room is sunken relative to an area upon which a speaker is to be placed, it might be desirable to angle speaker <b>25</b> in such a way that it directs the sound downwardly. This may be done by inclining the shelf <b>12</b> relative to the support <b>14</b>. In order to do this, there are provided one or two sets of adjuster plugs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Adjuster plugs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are made from a suitable plastic material and are of different relative heights. Both size plugs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are designed to be received within bore <b>46</b> of bushings <b>36</b> in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows that adjuster plugs <b>80</b> (and <b>82</b>) comprise an annular base <b>84</b> that is substantially of the same diameter as second section <b>46</b><i>b </i>of bore <b>46</b> and the same diameter as rod <b>22</b>. The upper end <b>86</b> of plug <b>80</b> is of a narrower diameter than base <b>84</b>, the difference in the diameter being that of the thickness of the rod <b>22</b> to be received around the same. Essentially, a small portion of the end of rod <b>22</b> slides over upper end <b>86</b> of plug <b>80</b> and becomes wedged between upper end <b>86</b> and that portion of bushing <b>36</b> that defines second section <b>46</b><i>b </i>of bore <b>46</b>. Plug <b>80</b> raises one end of shelf <b>12</b> away from support <b>14</b> by an angle &#x3b1;. Although not shown, plug <b>82</b> is longer than plug <b>80</b> and, consequently, would raise one end of shelf <b>12</b> away from support <b>14</b> by an angle greater than &#x3b1;. A speaker resting on shelf <b>12</b> will therefore be tilted slightly upwardly (by an angle &#x3b1;) and will therefore direct sound emitted therefrom slightly upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a similar fashion, if it is desirable to cause sound to be directed downwardly, plugs <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> may be inserted in bores <b>46</b> of the bushings <b>36</b> that receive rods <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> instead of rods <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. This will cause the opposite end of shelf <b>12</b> to be lifted and, consequently, a speaker resting on shelf <b>12</b> will be adjusted to cause the sound emitted therefrom to be directed downwardly toward floor surface <b>100</b>. Whether shelf <b>12</b> is tilted upwardly at the front or downwardly at the back, support <b>14</b> remains firmly seated on the floor surface <b>100</b> and remains horizontally disposed relative thereto. In both these instances, lip <b>24</b> plays an important roll keeping speaker <b>25</b> on shelf <b>12</b>. Furthermore, because of the presence of the oval shaped first section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of bores <b>46</b> in bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b>, vibrations can be polarized and dampened in stand <b>10</b> even when plugs <b>80</b> or <b>82</b> are utilized therein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be understood that it is possible that one of each of the adjuster plugs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> could be received within a single bore <b>46</b> of bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> if the tilt angle required a more extensive height adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Whenever stand <b>10</b> retains speaker <b>25</b> therein, the bushings <b>30</b>, <b>36</b>, and especially the flanges <b>42</b> and curved end portions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>a </i>aid in dampening the vertical vibrations emitted from speaker <b>25</b> because they flex.</p>

No unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed.</p>
