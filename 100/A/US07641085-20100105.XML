<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/866,472, filed on Nov. 20, 2006, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an apparatus and a related method for allowing a user to use an umbrella without having to carry it in his or her hands.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although umbrellas provide protection for the user in instances of sun, rain, sleet and even light snowfall, it is difficult to use an umbrella while performing tasks outdoors that require the use of both hands to be efficient. Moreover, carrying an umbrella when not in use is awkward. Over the years, various forms of hands free rain wear protection have been developed, but they are all awkward to carry or burdensome to wear. The stadium umbrella hat serves the criterion for being hands free, but it is awkward to carry, and is not likely to stay in place when the user is performing tasks of a physical nature or when the user is exposed to wind.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some examples of early attempts at umbrella supports are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,434,526, 2,496,769 and 3,204,650. These devices all require specially adapted umbrellas, and involve substantial use of rigid harness components that cannot be easily collapsed and stored. Moreover, these devices are extremely obtrusive, even when not holding an umbrella, making it difficult to sit or move naturally.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,554,203 and 4,188,965 describe devices that attempt to accommodate conventional umbrellas. However, the device shown in the '203 patent still utilizes a large, rigid back framework, rendering movements awkward and preventing easy storage of the device when not in use. The '965 patent requires extensive modifications to be made to the shaft of an umbrella before it can be used with the support device, and also required a large and unwieldy belt assembly, including a rigid metal plate and various pins and springs. Thus, this device is also obtrusive and difficult to store when in use, and an obstacle to normal movement when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A more recent approach to a hands-free umbrella support is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,520. The device shown in the '520 patent does not utilize rigid components, but does require a relatively large amount of material and is very obtrusive, particularly when viewed from the front, whether or not an umbrella is supported therein. Additionally, the device of the '520 patent makes no provision for inhibiting lateral movement of the umbrella pole in response to wind, and positions the umbrella with at a significant rearward angle. Thus, in many situations a greatly diminished protection from the elements may result.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a hands-free, light-weight apparatus that is collapsible so that it may be carried in a purse or pocket when it is not being used by the user, is unobtrusive when worn, and does not inhibit the normal movement of the user. Ideally, the apparatus can be used with a conventional umbrella and should not subject the user to excessive pressure when carrying the weight of the umbrella on the user's shoulders or back.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention an umbrella support device includes a halter strap formed as a loop having a connection point formed thereon for attachment to a belt, an umbrella cup attached to the halter strap proximate to the connection point for receiving an umbrella handle therein, and an umbrella stabilizer attached to the halter strap at a point furthest from the umbrella cup for accommodating an umbrella pole therethrough. According to an aspect of the present invention, the umbrella cup includes a fastener, such as a portion of a hook and loop fastener, for removably attaching the umbrella handle therein. In a kit, a complementary portion of the hook and loop fastener is included for attachment to the umbrella handle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method of donning the umbrella support device includes placing the halter strap over a user's first shoulder, placing the halter strap over the user's second shoulder such that the halter strap extends behind the user's neck, in front of the user's shoulders, under the user's arms and across the user's back. The method further includes orienting the halter strap such that an umbrella cup attached the halter strap is approximately centered across the user's back and an umbrella stabilizer attached to the halter strap is approximately centered behind the user's neck.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some of the features, advantages, and benefits of the present invention having been stated, others will become apparent as the description proceeds when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, presented solely for exemplary purposes and not with an intent to limit the invention thereto.</p>

Rather, these illustrated embodiments are provided solely for exemplary purposes so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention comprises an umbrella support device <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The umbrella support device <b>10</b> has an adjustable belt <b>12</b> and an adjustable halter strap <b>14</b>. The belt <b>12</b> comprises a single strap <b>16</b> with an adjustable connector <b>18</b> having a fixed connection to a receiving portion <b>20</b> of the connector and a strap adjustment feature <b>22</b> attached to an insertion portion <b>24</b> of the connector. The adjustment feature <b>22</b> is used to lengthen or shorten the belt strap <b>16</b> so that it may be comfortably secured around the user's waist. The connector <b>18</b> may be made of either a light weight metal or plastic. Because of its corrosion resistance, plastic is preferable as oxidation is likely to cause the belt material to degrade over time.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The halter strap <b>14</b> comprises at least one strap <b>26</b> that in a preferred embodiment forms a loop <b>29</b> that is adjustable by having one or more strap adjusting fasteners <b>28</b> that are located near both ends of the halter strap loop just above the point where the halter strap attaches to the belt. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, these strap adjusting fasteners <b>28</b> each comprise a simple loop holder <b>30</b> to which a substantially v-shaped folded portion <b>31</b> of the halter strap <b>14</b> is fixed to a first loop holder <b>30</b> on a lower bar <b>36</b>. A first end <b>38</b> of a second portion <b>40</b> of the halter strap <b>14</b> is fixed to a central bar <b>42</b> of an l-shaped loop holder <b>32</b>. The second portion <b>40</b> of the halter strap <b>14</b> is then looped around an upper bar <b>46</b> of the loop holder <b>30</b>, and then laced under the lower bar <b>48</b> of the l-shaped loop holder <b>32</b> and up through an opening created between a lower bar <b>48</b> and the central bar <b>42</b>. The halter strap <b>14</b> is then inserted into a second opening created between the central bar <b>42</b> and the upper bar <b>50</b> of the l-shaped loop holder <b>32</b>. By configuring the halter strap adjusting fasteners <b>28</b> in this manner, the fabric loop <b>52</b> that is created between the loop holder <b>30</b> and l-shaped loop holder <b>32</b> may be used to adjust the length of the halter strap <b>14</b> by increasing or decreasing the size of the loop <b>52</b>. In this manner, the halter strap <b>14</b> may be adjusted to suit the comfort of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An umbrella cup <b>56</b> is located at the point of connection <b>54</b> of the belt <b>12</b> and the halter strap <b>14</b>. The umbrella cup <b>56</b> may be a plastic cup suitable for holding the end of an umbrella handle, but will preferably be a cloth or plastic piece made of the same material as the halter strap <b>14</b> and belt <b>12</b> so that it is fully collapsible when not in use. A cloth umbrella cup <b>56</b> may be created using two separate pieces of strap materials as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A first strip <b>57</b> is folded to form a trapezoidal-shaped cup that is attached to a second piece <b>58</b> which forms a loop <b>59</b> for slidably attaching the umbrella cup <b>56</b> to the belt <b>12</b>. The trapezoidal shape, as well as a slight give in the construction, is useful to accommodate umbrella handles of different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To add further support for an umbrella <b>60</b>, a fastener, such as a portion <b>61</b> of a hook and loop fastener (e.g., Velcro&#xae;), is added to the inside of the umbrella cup <b>56</b>. To provide greatly enhanced stability and assistance in holding the umbrella <b>60</b> in place, an umbrella handle <b>62</b> is attached to a complementary portion <b>63</b> of the hook and loop fastener. This portion is preferably included in a kit with the support device <b>10</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the fastener <b>61</b> may be a snap, a hook and loop fastener, or any other mechanical connector that is suitable for this purpose. The portion <b>63</b> attached to the portion <b>61</b> in the bottom of the umbrella cup <b>56</b> then securely holds the umbrella <b>60</b> into the umbrella cup <b>56</b>, preventing rotation and detachment of the umbrella <b>60</b> even in a windy environment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the halter strap <b>14</b>, at the point furthest from the umbrella cup <b>56</b>, is an umbrella stabilizer <b>64</b> for holding the pole <b>66</b> of the umbrella <b>60</b> in place while in use. While those skilled in the art will recognize that the stabilizer <b>64</b> may consist of a strip of material that is snapped or hooked in place, in a preferred embodiment, a strap with a hook and loop fastener is preferred so that the stabilizer <b>64</b> may be easily fastened by the user. The stabilizer <b>64</b> may reside on either side of the halter strap <b>14</b>, but is preferably worn on the inside of the halter strap against the user's neck for greater stability in holding the umbrella <b>60</b> in place under windy conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To assure the invention is light-weight, both the belt <b>12</b> and the halter strap <b>14</b> may be made of conventional cloth, coated cloth, plastic or Gortex strapping, webbing, or the like, that can be folded and carried in a pocket or purse and unfolded for use. A small carrying pouch or case is also contemplated for holding the umbrella support device <b>10</b> when it is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, the umbrella support device <b>10</b> is first removed from its carrying pouch, if one is provided, and unfolded. The halter strap <b>14</b> is then adjusted so that it can fit snugly, but comfortably on the user. Once adjusted, the strap should be customized for the user. Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, one arm is placed in the loop <b>29</b>, and then the other arm is placed in the loop <b>29</b>, such that the halter strap <b>14</b> extends behind the user's neck, in front of the user's shoulders, under the user's arms and across the user's back. The halter strap <b>14</b> should be oriented such that the umbrella cup <b>56</b> is approximately centered across the user's back and the stabilizer strap <b>64</b> is approximately centered behind the user's neck.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The device should rest comfortably under the arms and on the shoulders so that the stabilizer strap <b>64</b> faces the neck. The stabilizer strap <b>64</b> may then be unhooked, if it is not already undone, so that it is loose and available for use once the umbrella <b>60</b> is slid into place. The belt <b>12</b> is then drawn around the waist, fastened and adjusted as required using connector <b>18</b>. The belt <b>12</b> and halter strap <b>14</b> are preferably adjusted for a snug fit. An umbrella <b>60</b> is then slipped into place under the halter strap <b>14</b> at the user's neck, with a terminal end of an umbrella handle <b>62</b> resting in the umbrella cup <b>56</b>, such that the fastener portion <b>61</b> and the complementary portion <b>63</b> engage. The user then re-attaches the stabilizer strap <b>64</b> around the user's neck to hold the umbrella pole <b>66</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be appreciated from the foregoing, that an umbrella support according to the present invention is formed with less material and an extremely low profile relative to prior art umbrella holders. Furthermore, the umbrella support device <b>10</b> does not require a bulky, rigid apparatus to immobilize the umbrella, is completely collapsible, and can be easily stored in a purse, bag or backpack when not use. With the exception of buckles and slides, the entire umbrella support device can be formed almost entirely of webbing or other fabrics, greatly facilitating manufacturing and distribution, and minimizing the shelf space required for display. When worn, the umbrella support device is relatively unobtrusive, exhibiting from the front only relatively small sections of the halter strap <b>14</b> and the belt <b>12</b>. Alternately, the halter strap <b>14</b> can be connected to a conventional belt, further reducing visible indicia that the umbrella support device is being worn. Also, the umbrella support device can be comfortably worn under outerwear, such as a shirt or jacket, without or without an umbrella in place. Additionally, the umbrella support device does not require a special umbrella, and can be used with the large majority of conventional umbrella designs without requiring substantial modifications thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the specification there have been disclosed preferred embodiments of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, terms are used in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. The invention has been described in some detail, but it will be apparent that various modifications and changes can be made within the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the foregoing specification and as defined in the appended claims.</p>
