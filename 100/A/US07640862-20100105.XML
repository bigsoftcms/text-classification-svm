<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A roller coaster includes a cab that is rotatable between position for loading and unloading of passenger(s) and a position for riding the roller coaster. The cab includes a sliding pad mechanism, which is slidable on station entry and/or exit cams to move the cab between the two positions. In the position for loading and unloading the passenger(s), the cab is arranged so that the passenger(s) are non-parallel to a track of the roller coaster, and in the position for riding, the cab is arranged so that the passenger(s) are substantially parallel to the track.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a roller coaster. More particularly, the present invention relates to a roller coaster including a cab that rotates between a loading/unloading position, which may be a substantially vertical position relative to the ground, for loading and unloading of passenger(s), and a riding position, which may be a substantially horizontal position relative to the track along which the cab travels, for riding the roller coaster.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The growth of the amusement industry has led to the development of various exciting roller coaster designs. A roller coaster may allow the rider to securely soar in a prone &#x201c;superego&#x201d; position. A roller coaster of this type is believed to be described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,333.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such prone riding roller coasters require a safe, controlled, reliable mechanism, involving minimum maintenance, to rotate the cab from the substantially vertical position to the substantially horizontal position at the ride station exit and to rotate the cab from the substantially horizontal position to the substantially vertical position at the ride station entry.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While other roller coasters may be suitable for the particular purpose employed, or for general use, they are not as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as disclosed hereafter.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a roller coaster including a carriage and a cab that rotates relative to the carriage between a position for loading and unloading of a passenger and a position for riding the roller coaster. This loading and unloading position may be substantially vertical relative to the ground, e.g., substantially perpendicular to the track, and the riding position may be substantially horizontal to the ground, e.g., parallel to the track.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cab includes two sliding pads, which slide on station entry and exit cams for rotating the cab between the loading and unloading position and the riding position, e.g., between the substantially vertical and horizontal positions. The cab further includes a first arm pivotally connected to the cab on one end and having a first cam follower, e.g., a wheel, on the opposite end and a second arm pivotally connected to the cab on one end and having a second cam follower, e.g., a wheel, on the opposite end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The station exit cam has an upward sloping portion in the direction of travel of the vehicle. The sliding plates slide over the station exit cam to pivot, rotate and/or otherwise move the cab relative to the carriage from the loading and unloading position to the riding position. As the carriage moves in the direction of travel towards the station exit, the first cam follower is guided over a first exit cam connected to station exit cam, pivoting the arm relative to the cab and triggering a locking mechanism which locks the cab in the riding position, e.g., a substantially horizontal position, relative to the carriage. This locking mechanism assures that the rider is maintained in the riding position, e.g., a prone position relative to the track, throughout the ride. The locking mechanism may include one or more security bars connected on one end to the cab and engaging a locking retainer on the carriage on the other end. The locking mechanism may also include one or more security bars connected on one end to the carriage and engaging a locking retainer on the cab on the other end. Triggering of the locking mechanism extends the security bars into the locking retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At the end of the ride, the carriage, still moving in the direction of travel, enters the station entry and passes over a station entry cam. The first cam follower is guided over a first entry cam which pivots its connected arm such that the cab is unlocked from the carriage. The first and second sliding pads slide along the station entry cam, having a downward slope in the direction of travel of the vehicle, causing the cab to pivot, rotate and/or otherwise move to a substantially vertical position as the carriage moves in the direction of travel. Further, the second cam follower is guided over a second entry cam causing the second arm to rotate and trigger an opening of a cage used to secure the rider within the cab during the ride.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">During the course of the ride, between the station exit and the station entry, the rider may be maintained in a riding position that is substantially parallel to the track at the instantaneous position of the rider relative to the track. The track may include sloping portions relative to the ground and/or horizontal portions relative to the ground. During the course of the ride, or portion(s) thereof, motion and movement of the roller coaster along the track may be caused by gravity, a chain drive, motor drive, linear motor drive, magnetic levitation drive, a magnetic propulsion system, a pneumatic system, a hydraulic system, a pulley system, a cable drive system, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an example embodiment of the present invention, a roller coaster includes: a carriage; a cab at least pivotally connected to the carriage, the cab rotatable relative to the carriage between a first position substantially parallel to a track and a second position non-parallel to the track; and at least one of a station entry cam having a first predetermined profile and a station exit cam having a second predetermined profile. The cab may include a sliding pad mechanism configured to slide on at least one of the at least one of the station entry cam and the station exit cam to move the cab from a first one of the first position and the second position to a second one of the first position and the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an example embodiment of the present invention, a roller coaster includes: a track; a carriage movable along the track; a cab at least pivotally connected to the carriage, the cab at least rotatable relative to the carriage between a first position substantially parallel to the track and a second position non-parallel to the track; and at least one of a station entry cam having a first predetermined profile and a station exit cam having a second predetermined profile. The cab may include a sliding pad mechanism configured to slide on at least one of the at least one of the station entry cam and the station exit cam to move the cab from a first one of the first position and the second position to a second one of the first position and the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an example embodiment of the present invention, a roller coaster includes: track means; carriage means movable along the track means; cab means at least pivotally connected to the carriage means, the cab means including means for rotating the cab relative to the carriage means between a first position substantially parallel to the track means and a second position non-parallel to the track means; and at least one of station entry camming means and a station exit camming means. The cab means may include means for sliding on at least one of the at least one of the station entry camming means and the station exit camming means to move the cab means from a first one of the first position and the second position to a second one of the first position and the second position</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a side elevational view of an exemplary embodiment of a roller coaster station entry and exit of the present invention. An exemplary embodiment of a roller coaster <b>10</b> includes a vehicle <b>14</b> suspended from a track <b>12</b> and includes a carriage <b>16</b> and a cab <b>18</b>. The carriage <b>16</b> is suspended from the track <b>12</b> at a front axle <b>11</b> and a rear axle <b>15</b>. An arrow labeled D.O.T. indicates the direction of travel of the vehicle <b>14</b> as it passes through the stations. The carriage <b>16</b> may include a bumper to prevent steel-to-steel contact between the different vehicles in the station and on a storage track. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a single vehicle <b>14</b>, it should be understood that several vehicles <b>14</b> may be provided, e.g., side-by-side, in tandem, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cab <b>18</b> includes a cage <b>20</b> and a cover, e.g., a plexiglass cover, for securing a rider <b>22</b> in the cab <b>18</b> and preventing the rider's extremities from passing outside a clearance envelope around the vehicle <b>14</b>. Cage <b>20</b> may be spring loaded, pneumatically actuated, hydraulically actuated, driven by a linear motor, rotary motor, geared transmission, chain/cable drive, cam driven, driven by a linkage system, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The vehicle <b>14</b> is shown in various different ride states in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At ride state A, the cab <b>18</b> is in a loading/unloading position, e.g., substantially vertical relative to the ground and perpendicular to the track, allowing rider <b>22</b> to comfortably enter/exit the cab <b>18</b>, e.g., by climbing up two or three steps on a ladder. The weight distribution of the cab <b>18</b>, i.e., gravity, maintains the cab <b>18</b> in the loading/unloading position. Cage <b>20</b>, which is biased in the open position by gas springs, is closed by an operator securing the rider <b>22</b> in the cab <b>18</b>. As the cab <b>18</b> passes over the station exit cam <b>24</b>, ride state B, it is gently forced into a locked riding position, e.g., substantially horizontal relative to the ground and parallel to the track, allowing the rider <b>22</b> to enjoy the roller coaster ride in a prone position with reference to the track, i.e., the rider <b>22</b> is substantially parallel to the track between the station exit and the station entry, or between portions thereof. After completion of the ride, the rider <b>22</b> enters the station entry, ride state C, still in the prone position. The cab <b>18</b> then passes over the station entry cam <b>26</b>, ride state D, and is gently rotated back to the loading/unloading position. Platform <b>32</b> supports the rider <b>22</b> as he or she loads and unloads the cab <b>18</b>. This system allows for a continuous flow during loading/unloading operations and supports to increase the capacity of the ride.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side elevational view of the station exit. The carriage <b>16</b> can be seen suspended to the track <b>12</b> via rollers <b>28</b> and is pushed by a series of kick-off motors <b>13</b>. The cab <b>18</b> is pivotably connected to the carriage at a rotating axle <b>17</b>. While still in the loading/unloading state, labeled State #<b>1</b>, and while moving in the direction of the arrow labeled D.O.T., a first sliding pad <b>34</b> connected to the cab <b>18</b> contacts station exit cam <b>24</b> and begins to slide on cam <b>24</b> on an upward slope causing the cab <b>18</b> to begin to rotate relative to the carriage <b>16</b>. As the carriage moves further towards the station exit (in the figure, to the left), a second sliding pad <b>36</b> contacts station exit cam <b>24</b> and its sliding against station exit cam <b>24</b> further acts to rotate cab <b>18</b> relative to carriage <b>16</b> such that the cab <b>18</b> is in the riding position prior to leaving the station exit (State #<b>2</b>). A first cam follower <b>38</b>, e.g., a wheel, connected to the cab <b>18</b> via arm <b>44</b> is guided, e.g., rolls, over a first exit cam <b>42</b> (shown in ghost lines because it is connected to the opposite non-visible of station exit cam <b>24</b>) triggering the locking of cab <b>18</b> in the riding position relative to the carriage <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The locking mechanism may include one or more security bars connected on one end to the cab <b>18</b> and extendable into a locking retainer on the carriage <b>16</b>. The locking mechanism may also include one or more security bars connected on one end to the carriage <b>16</b> and extendable into a locking retainer on the cab <b>18</b>. The extension of the security bars may be triggered by the first cam follower <b>38</b> being guided over the first exit cam <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Locking/unlocking of the cab <b>18</b> and triggering of the locking/unlocking may be actuated by mechanisms other than the security bars, including proximity sensors, gas springs, solenoids, screw drives, linear motors, hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first sliding pad <b>34</b> (also referred to as a skid plate) has a profile adapted to be in sliding contact with the station exit cam <b>24</b> over a first angular range between the loading/unloading position of the cab <b>18</b> and an intermediate angular position of the cab <b>18</b>. In the intermediate position of the cab <b>18</b> both the first sliding pad <b>34</b> and the second sliding pad <b>36</b> (also referred to as a skid plate) are in sliding contact with the station exit cam <b>24</b>. Upon further rotation of the cab <b>18</b> from the intermediate position toward the riding position, the first sliding pad <b>34</b> loses contact with the station exit cam <b>24</b>, the cab <b>18</b> being thereafter rotated to the riding position by the sliding contact or camming action of the second sliding pad <b>36</b> and the station exit cam <b>24</b>. As illustrated in the Figures, the second sliding pad <b>36</b> may be substantially flat and may be pivotable about an axis, e.g., by a pin connection, relative to the cab <b>18</b> to maintain sliding contact over substantially an entire surface of the second sliding pad <b>36</b>. It should be appreciated that either one or both of the sliding pads <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may have any shape or may be stationary or pivotable in accordance with the desired pivoting motion of the cab <b>18</b> or in accordance with the profile of the station exit cam <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a back view of the vehicle <b>14</b> taken along the direction of line <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. First exit cam <b>42</b> is shown connected on one side of the station exit cam <b>24</b>. The second sliding pad <b>36</b> can be seen sliding on station exit cam <b>24</b>. Further, a support member <b>58</b> for station exit cam <b>24</b> is shown fixed to the ground <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> illustrate how the first sliding pad <b>34</b> and the second sliding pad <b>36</b> operate to rotate the cab <b>18</b> into the riding position at the station exit. Only a simplified bottom portion of the cab <b>18</b> is shown for clarity. Sliding pad <b>34</b> is pivotally connected at pivot point <b>40</b> to the cab <b>18</b> and towards an opposite end may optionally be connected via a compression spring <b>46</b> to cab <b>18</b>. Second sliding pad <b>36</b> is pivotally connected at pivot point <b>48</b> to cab <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates the cab <b>18</b> still in the loading/unloading position with sliding pad <b>34</b> about to contact station exit cam <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the cab <b>18</b> a bit closer to the station exit with the sliding pad <b>34</b> in full contact with the station exit cam <b>24</b> and compression spring <b>46</b> in a fully compressed state. Sliding pad <b>34</b> slides along station exit cam <b>24</b> causing the cab <b>18</b> to pivot relative to the carriage <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the cab <b>18</b> even closer to the station exit. The first sliding pad <b>34</b> has lost contact with the station exit cam <b>24</b> and the second sliding pad <b>36</b> contacts the station exit cam <b>24</b>. As the carriage <b>16</b> moves further towards the station exit, the second sliding pad <b>36</b> continues to slide along the station exit cam <b>24</b> forcing the cab <b>18</b> into the riding position, illustrated at ride state B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side elevational view of the station entry. As cab <b>18</b> passes over station entry cam <b>26</b> cam follower <b>38</b> is guided, e.g., rolls, over first entry cam <b>50</b> (shown in ghost lines because it is connected to the opposite non-visible side of station entry cam <b>26</b>) which pivots arm <b>44</b> and unlocks the cab <b>18</b> from the carriage <b>16</b>. As indicated above, the locking mechanism may include one or more security-bars, in which case, guiding of cam follower <b>38</b> over the first entry cam <b>50</b> retracts the security bar from the locking retainer on either the cab <b>18</b> or carriage <b>16</b>. The station entry cam <b>26</b> via first sliding pad <b>34</b> pushes the vehicle <b>14</b> upward, e.g., about 4 to 5 mm. Second sliding pad <b>36</b> slides along station entry cam <b>26</b>, having a downward slope, which causes the cab to rotate towards the loading/unloading position. See, for example, the rider states D and A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As the cab <b>18</b> travels further in the direction of travel over station entry cam <b>26</b> second cam follower <b>52</b> is guided, e.g., rolls, over a second entry cam <b>54</b>, which pivots a second wheel arm <b>56</b> which unlocks the cage <b>20</b>, thus allowing, the rider <b>22</b> to exit the cab <b>18</b>. A handle may also be provided on the outside of cab <b>18</b> to manually release or open the cage <b>20</b>. The handle is not reachable by a rider <b>22</b> while in the cab <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a back view of the vehicle <b>14</b> taken along the direction of line <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. First entry cam <b>50</b> and second entry cam <b>54</b> are shown connected on either side of the station entry cam <b>26</b>. The second sliding pad <b>36</b> can be seen sliding on station entry cam <b>26</b>. Further, a support member <b>60</b> for station entry cam <b>26</b> is shown fixed to the ground <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate how the first sliding pad <b>34</b> and the second sliding pad <b>36</b> operate to rotate the cab <b>18</b> into the loading/unloading position at the station entry <b>26</b>. Only a simplified bottom portion of the cab <b>18</b> is shown for clarity. Security springs may be provided which resist rotation of the cab <b>18</b> from the riding position to the unloading/loading position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the cab <b>18</b> in the riding position with the second sliding pad <b>36</b> sliding against the station entry cam <b>26</b>.
