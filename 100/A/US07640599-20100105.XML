<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/888,578 filed Feb. 7, 2007.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates, in general, to bibs and, more particularly, this invention relates to devices which provide care givers of infants a way to record the time of an infant's last meal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior to the conception and development of the present invention, bibs, as are generally well known in the prior art, have been used to keep an infant's clothing clean during feeding times. However, no bibs exist which incorporate a means for such infant's care provider to record the time of such infant's last feeding such that the care provider and others have a quick and easy to reach reference upon which to rely in anticipating when such infant will need fed again as opposed to waiting for such infant to signal hunger by crying or fussing thereby creating a situation which can be stressful to both care providers and such infant.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a bib for illustrating an infant's last feeding time. Such bib includes a cover member for covering a predetermined portion of an infant's clothing. Such cover member being manufactured from a first predetermined material and having a first predetermined size and first predetermined shape. A securing means is operably connected to such cover member at a predetermined location thereon for securing such cover member at least one of around such infant's neck, to such infant and to such infant's clothing. Indicia is formed on such cover member for illustrating predetermined information relating to a last feeding time of such infant. An indicator means is disposed on such cover member for indicating such infant's last feeding time.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is, therefore, one of the primary objects of the present invention to provide a bib which includes a means for recording an infant's last feeding time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a bib which will permit an infant's care provider to anticipate a time when such infant will need to be fed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device which will alleviate some of the stress involved in caring for an infant.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device which will make an infant more comfortable by enabling such infant's care providers to be more aware of such infant's feeding needs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional object of the present invention is to provide a device to aid in the care of infants which is easy to manufacture and can be purchased by consumers at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to the various objects and advantages of the present invention described with some degree of specificity above it should be obvious that additional objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those persons who are skilled in the relevant art from the following more detailed description of the invention, particularly, when such description is taken in conjunction with the attached drawing figures and with the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Prior to proceeding to the more detailed description of the present invention it should be noted that, for the sake of clarity and understanding, identical components which have identical functions have been identified with identical reference numerals throughout the several views illustrated in the drawing figures.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference is now made, more particularly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. A bib, generally designated <b>10</b>, for illustrating an infant's last feeding time is provided. Such bib includes a cover member <b>12</b> for covering a predetermined portion of at least one of an infant and an infant's clothing. Such cover member <b>12</b> is manufactured from a first predetermined material and has a first predetermined size and a first predetermined shape. It is presently preferred that such first predetermined material is selected from the group consisting of plastic and fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A securing means <b>14</b> is operably connected to such cover member <b>12</b> at a predetermined location thereon for securing such cover member <b>12</b> at least one of around such infant's neck, to such infant and to such infant's clothing. It is presently preferred that such securing means <b>14</b> is at least one of snaps <b>15</b>, buttons, and a hook and loop type securing means <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Indicia <b>16</b> is formed on such cover member <b>12</b> for illustrating predetermined information relating to a last feeding time of such infant. It is presently preferred that such indicia <b>16</b> includes at least a face of a clock <b>18</b>. It is further presently preferred that such indicia <b>16</b> further includes at least one of numbers <b>21</b>, letters <b>23</b>, words <b>25</b>, pictures, and symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An indicator means <b>20</b> is removeably disposed on such cover member <b>12</b> for indicating such infant's last feeding time. It is presently preferred that such indicator means <b>20</b> is a pair of rotateable arm members <b>22</b>, having a second predetermined shape and a second predetermined size and being manufactured from a second predetermined material, such pair of arm members <b>22</b> being operably connected to such cover member <b>12</b>. It is presently preferred that such second predetermined material is selected from the group consisting of metal, plastic and fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is further presently preferred that such rotatable arm members <b>22</b> are formed as hands <b>24</b> of such clock <b>18</b> such that a user can move the hands <b>24</b> of such clock <b>18</b> to a position indicative of a time of such infant's last feeding. It is presently most preferred that the hands <b>24</b> of such clock <b>18</b> are formed such that a first one of the hands <b>24</b> of such clock <b>18</b> is shaped as a spoon <b>26</b> and a second one of the hands <b>24</b> of such clock <b>18</b> is shaped as a fork <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is presently preferred that such bib <b>10</b> further includes a fastening means <b>30</b> having a first portion <b>32</b> disposed on a predetermined side of each of said hands <b>24</b> and a second portion <b>34</b> disposed on said cover member <b>12</b> adjacent each number <b>36</b> on said clock <b>18</b>. It is presently preferred that such fastening means <b>30</b> is at least one of snaps <b>15</b>, buttons, and a hook and loop type fastening means <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While a presently preferred and various alternative embodiments of the present invention have been described in sufficient detail above to enable a person skilled in the relevant art to make and use the same it should be obvious that various other adaptations and modifications can be envisioned by those persons skilled in such art without departing from either the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.</p>
