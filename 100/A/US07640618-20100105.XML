<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a disposable cleaning article to be held by a holder and used as a cleaning mop or by a hand and, more particularly, to a cleaning article provided with a brush portion having a high effect to trap dust and a high rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the cleaning article of the conventional mop type for cleaning the room, its brush portion is usually formed of twisted yarns of cotton or the like. However, the cleaning article of this kind is so expensive in manufacturing cost that it is difficult to sold it as a disposable (i.e., single-use) product. In addition, the cleaning article of this kind can absorb dust by an adhesive oil agent such as liquid paraffin, which is applied to the surfaces of the twisted yarns; but the twisted yarns per se are not good in dust trapping power. Therefore, it has a defect in capability of trapping hair or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, the cleaning articles as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 154791/1997 and 38009/1997 are designed for disposable use. These cleaning articles can be attached to a holder. The former is formed by laminating two sheets of nonwoven fabric to leave their peripheral portions unadhered to each other; and the latter is formed by cutting a peripheral portion of a nonwoven fabric to form a duster portion having long narrow strips.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These cleaning articles, as disclosed in the above-mentioned official gazettes and formed of a nonwoven fabric, are inexpensive and suitable for disposable use. Moreover, they can easily wipe off fine dust. However, the cleaning articles per se are so flat that the capability of trapping relatively large dust is low.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, disposable cleaning-articles in which a brush portion is formed of fibers are also known in the art. However, since the brush portion is formed only of fibers, the rigidity of the brush portion is lowered. Therefore, the fibers are entangled or curled during the cleaning operation. As a result, the portion to function substantially as the brush portion is compressed to cause a defect that the dust trapping effect of the fibers cannot be sufficiently exhibited.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has an object to provide a cleaning article which is provided with a brush portion having a high dust collecting ability and a high shape retention and which can be manufactured at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleaning article comprising a brush portion including: a plurality of strips; and at least one layer of a fiber bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This cleaning article can trap fine dust with its fiber bundle layer forming the brush portion, while suppressing the entanglement of the fibers with the strips. In addition, the strips per se can exhibit the cleaning effect. With the strips, moreover, the brush portion is so increased in rigidity as to have a high shape retention against an external force.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, this cleaning article may be constructed such that at least one sheet having the plurality of strips formed therein and the fiber bundle layer are stacked on and partially joined to a base material. If they are thus joined, disaggregation or entanglement of fibers forming the fiber bundle layer can be suppressed so that the dust trapping ability of the brush portion is also enhanced at its face adjacent to the base material.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base material may be a sheet formed with strips. This can enhance the contact with the object to be cleaned, which may have various surface shapes, so that the dust trapping ability can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cleaning article according to the first aspect of the invention may be constructed such that the sheet appears on the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side. In this construction, since the strips having a relatively high rigidity are positioned on the outermost face, there hardly occurs a phenomenon that fibers of the fiber bundle layer are entangled and fixed during the cleaning operation, so that the cleaning article can stand the use of a long term.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, the fiber bundle layer may appear on the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side, in place of the secondary sheet. In this construction, the fiber bundle layer can conform to the fine irregularities of the object to be cleaned, to thereby have an improved contact. Therefore, the fine dust trapping ability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Here, it is preferred that fibers of the fiber bundle layer are fixed to one another over a predetermined length from a portion where the fiber bundle layer is joined to the base material. With the fibers of the fiber bundle layer being fixed to one another over a predetermined length from the joining portion, even if the fiber bundle layer appears on the outermost face, the fibers of the fiber bundle layer can be prevented from being entangle or massed by the friction during the cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also possible that another fiber bundle layer is provided such that one fiber bundle layer closer to the base material has a basis weight larger than that of the other fiber bundle layer closer to the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side. In this construction, the base material can be prevented during the cleaning operation from being exposed on the cleaning side of the cleaning article. In addition, the cleaning article can provide a sufficient cushioning feel during the cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the base material is provided on its outer face opposed to the cleaning face with a holding sheet. In this construction, for example, between the outer face of the base material and the holding sheet, there may be formed a holding space into which a hand of a user or a holder is enabled to be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, the fiber bundle layer may be joined to the base material at two sides of the holding space extending in a direction along which the hand or holder is permitted to be inserted. In this construction, the object to be cleaned is not affected by the hardness of the holder so that the cleaning article provides a smooth contact feel when used for cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleaning article comprising: at least two sheets, at least one of which has a plurality of strips; and at least two layers of a fiber bundle, wherein the two sheets are overlaid and joined to each other at two joining portions, which define a holding space between the confronting faces of the two sheets, and the two fiber bundle layers are disposed on the cleaning faces, respectively, of the two sheets, and are joined thereto at the two joining portions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cleaning article according to the second aspect of the invention can exhibit the cleaning function on both its surface and back. Therefore, it can be used for cleaning operation without any attention to its cleaning side. Moreover, since the cleaning article can be used for cleaning operation firstly with one face and then with the other face, a long life is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this construction, too, it is possible that the strips and the fiber bundle layers form a brush portion. Therefore, the cleaning article can trap fine dust while suppressing entanglement of fibers. In addition, the strips per se can exhibit the cleaning effect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Here, it is possible that some of fibers of the fiber bundle layer are not extended continuously between the two joining portions so as to form fiber brush portions, each extending from one of the two joining portions and having a free end. These fiber brush portions can exhibit dust wiping function to thereby improve the cleaning ability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the two sheets and the fiber bundle layers may further be joined to one another midway between the two joining portions to divide the holding space into two parallel holding spaces, and the fiber extending direction in the fiber bundle layers may traverse the two holding spaces. In this construction, these holding spaces are preferably opened at their two opposite ends for insertion of the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the foregoing individual constructions, it is preferred that the fiber bundle layer is partially joined to adjacent strips, at midway positions of the adjacent strips. With this construction, the fiber bundle layer moves together with the strips so that the fiber bundle layer can be prevented from moving independently to have its fibers entangled or massed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, it is preferred that a sheet for forming the strips is formed of either a nonwoven fabric comprising thermoplastic fibers or a thermoplastic resin film. Also, it is preferred that the fiber bundle comprises heat-fusible thermoplastic fibers. Here, the sheet having the strips and the fiber bundle layer can be joined to each other easily and quickly by heat-fusing. Especially if the thermoplastic fibers are used for forming the sheet, the nonwoven fabric can be manufactured by a through-air bonding process to have a high rigidity and elasticity.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a cleaning article <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown with its cleaning side upward. The cleaning article <b>1</b> comprises a primary sheet (or base sheet) <b>2</b>, and a first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, a second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b>, a secondary sheet <b>5</b> having strips formed therein, and a third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> laminated subsequently upward on the cleaning face of the base sheet <b>2</b>. The shorter sides of the cleaning article <b>1</b> extend parallel to the feeding direction (or MD) along which materials for the above-mentioned layers are continuously fed on the production line. These individual layers (i.e., the base sheet <b>2</b>, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b>, the secondary sheet <b>5</b> and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>) are joined altogether at an all-layer joining line <b>7</b> extending perpendicularly to MD.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown, the base sheet <b>2</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> are individually formed of a nonwoven fabric formed only of or containing thermoplastic fibers (i.e., heat-fusible fibers). Examples of the thermoplastic fibers include: fibers of PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene) or PET (polyethylene terephthalate); and conjugated fibers of PE/PET or PE/PP (e.g., conjugated fibers of a core/sheath structure having a core of PP or PET and a sheath of PE). The nonwoven fabric may be a thermal bonded nonwoven fabric, a spun-bonded nonwoven fabric or a spun-laced nonwoven fabric. Alternatively, the base sheet <b>2</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> may be formed of a thermoplastic resin film such as a PE film or a PP film. Of course, it is also possible that the base sheet <b>2</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> are formed of a laminated sheet of a nonwoven fabric and a resin film.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In order to increase the rigidity and elasticity, it is preferred that the base sheet <b>2</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> are formed of a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric in which the thermoplastic fibers are bonded with heated air. Especially where the sheet <b>5</b> is disposed to form the outermost face of the cleaning article on the cleaning side (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), it is desirable that the sheet <b>5</b> is formed of a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment shown, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> individually comprise a bundle of thermoplastic filaments. These individual filaments extend continuously to traverse each fiber bundle layer. Such a fiber bundle layer can be easily formed by opening a tow of filaments. More specifically, each fiber bundle layer can be formed over a sheet by the following steps of: opening a tow of filaments to have a predetermined width and a predetermined thickness (or bulk), while being fed continuously in MD; joining the opened tow onto a continuously fed sheet material; and cutting the tow together with the sheet material at an interval (corresponding to the size of the cleaning article in MD). The filaments may be made of any suitable materials such as PE, PP, PET, Ne (nylon), rayon, or combination thereof. Preferably, the filaments are conjugated fibers of a core/sheath structure having a core of PP or PET and a sheath of PE.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The filaments are preferred to have a fineness of 1 to 50 dtex, more preferably 2 to 10 dtex. Here, the individual fiber bundle layers may contain fibers of different finenesses.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, the fibers forming the fiber bundle layer of the invention should not be limited to the filaments. For the fiber bundle layer, flat yarns or split yarns may also be employed. The flat yarns are prepared by slitting a film into tapes and by stretching the tapes in the longitudinal direction. The split yarns are prepared by splitting a thermoplastic film in the direction perpendicular to the orientation direction of the resin so that the film is fibrillated and interconnected into a net shape.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the fibers forming the fiber bundle layer of the invention are crimped. With the fibers being crimped, the fiber bundle layer becomes so bulky as to take a structure enabled to capture dust easily by the crimped portions. Especially preferred are crimped filaments opened from a tow.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here will be described the structures of the individual layers forming the cleaning article <b>1</b> and the procedure for laminating the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the base sheet <b>2</b> which is formed of a spun-bonded nonwoven fabric, a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, or the like. The base sheet <b>2</b> has a central region <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and strip-forming regions <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>lying opposite one another and sandwiching the central region <b>2</b><i>a </i>therebetween. On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the base sheet <b>2</b> with its back face <b>2</b>B upward. Over the back face <b>2</b>B, there is laid a holding sheet <b>8</b> extending from the central region <b>2</b><i>a </i>to the strip-forming regions <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment shown, the holding sheet <b>8</b> is formed, like the base sheet <b>2</b>, of a nonwoven fabric such as a spun-bonded nonwoven fabric, a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, or the like. However, the holding sheet <b>8</b> may be formed of a resin film. The base sheet <b>2</b> and the holding sheet <b>8</b> are identical in their sizes in MD, but not identical in their sizes in the direction perpendicular to MD. The holding sheet <b>8</b> is shorter than the base sheet <b>2</b> in the direction perpendicular to MD.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the holding sheet <b>8</b> being laid over the outer face <b>2</b>B of the base sheet <b>2</b>, cut lines <b>11</b> in a zigzag shape (or in a saw-tooth shape) are cut in the strip-forming regions <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, to form a plurality of strips <b>12</b>, which are separated from one another by the cut lines <b>11</b> and elongated in MD, in the base sheet <b>2</b> and the holding sheet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Over a cleaning face <b>2</b>A of the base sheet <b>2</b> having the strips <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, there is laid the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>. At this time, the individual filaments forming the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> extend in MD, and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> has a predetermined bulk over the cleaning face <b>2</b>A of the base sheet <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In such a laminated state, the base sheet <b>2</b>, the holding sheet <b>8</b> disposed on the outer face <b>2</b>B, and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> disposed on the cleaning face <b>2</b>A are joined together at joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>13</b> and joining lines <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>. Here, the joining is performed by heat-sealing, ultrasonic sealing or the like, so that the base sheet <b>2</b>, holding sheet <b>8</b> and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> are fusion-bonded at the joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The paired joining lines <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> are formed along the boundary lines between the central region <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the strip-forming regions <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, so that they extend parallel with one another while being spaced in MD. On the other hand, the joining lines <b>14</b>, <b>14</b> are formed in a zigzag shape (or in a saw-tooth shape) in the strip-forming regions <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in an enlarged scale, the individual filaments forming the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> are joined to the underlying strips <b>12</b> at the joining lines <b>14</b> extending obliquely transversely over the strips <b>12</b> at midway areas between their longitudinal ends. With the joining lines <b>14</b>, motions of the individual filaments can be restrained so properly that the filaments are prevented from being excessively separated or entangled, while being enabled to move over the strips <b>12</b> relatively freely, to thereby exhibit an excellent dust collecting effect.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the state in which the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> are laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sheet <b>5</b> is formed of a spun-bonded or through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, like the base sheet <b>2</b>, or a resin film. The sheet <b>5</b> has the same size and shape as those of the base sheet <b>2</b>, except for those of strips formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The sheet <b>5</b> has a central region <b>5</b><i>a </i>and strip-forming regions <b>5</b><i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>lying opposite one another and sandwiching the central region <b>5</b><i>a </i>therebetween. These strip-forming regions <b>5</b><i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are cut to form a plurality of cut lines <b>16</b> extending in a zigzag shape (or in a saw-tooth shape) from the longer side edges of the sheet <b>5</b> toward the central portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>in MD. Thus, there are formed a plurality of strips <b>17</b> which are separated by the cut lines <b>16</b> and elongated in MD.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the strips <b>12</b> of the base sheet <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> have a length L<b>1</b> and a width W<b>1</b> and if the strips <b>17</b> of the sheet <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> have a length L<b>2</b> and a width W<b>2</b>, L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>1</b> and W<b>1</b>&#x3e;W<b>2</b> so that the strips <b>17</b> are thinner and longer than the strips <b>12</b>. Here, the individual strips <b>12</b> and <b>17</b> are formed to have widths of at least 2 mm, preferably widths of 2 to 50 mm and lengths of 10 to 100 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> is laminated on the back face <b>5</b>B of the sheet <b>5</b>. In the manufacture process, the back face <b>5</b>B of the sheet <b>5</b> is directed upward, and the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> is laid over the back face <b>5</b>B. At this time, the individual filaments forming the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> extend in MD, and the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> has a predetermined bulk over the back face <b>5</b>B of the sheet <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In such a laminated state, the strips <b>17</b> and the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> are joined together at joining portions <b>18</b> which are positioned midway between longitudinal ends of the strips <b>17</b>. At these joining portions <b>18</b>, specifically, the strips <b>17</b> and the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> are fusion-bonded by heat-sealing or ultrasonic sealing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the joining portions <b>18</b> are formed alternately in every others of strips <b>17</b> which are arranged in the direction perpendicular to MD. In other words, the strips <b>17</b> with and without the joining portions <b>18</b> alternate with each other. However, all the strips <b>17</b> may have the joining portions <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in a partially enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> is joined to the overlying strips <b>17</b> at the joining portions <b>18</b> positioned midway between the longitudinal ends of the strips <b>17</b>. Therefore, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> is retained in its shape by the strips <b>17</b> so that the filaments forming the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> are prevented from being excessively entangled or curled.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At the final stage of the manufacture process of the cleaning article <b>1</b>, over the first laminate in which the base sheet <b>2</b>, the holding sheet <b>8</b> and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> are laminated and joined, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, there is laid the second laminate in which the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> are laminated and joined, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At this lamination, the first and second laminates are laid such that the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> lies over the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Over the cleaning face <b>5</b>A of the sheet <b>5</b> of the second laminate, moreover, there is laid the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The individual filaments forming the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> extend in MD, and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> has a substantially homogeneous bulk over the cleaning face <b>5</b>A of the sheet <b>5</b>. Then, the holding sheet <b>8</b>, the base sheet <b>2</b>, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b>, the sheet <b>5</b> and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> are joined altogether into an integral structure at the all-layer joining line <b>7</b> which extends in MD along the center line of the cleaning article <b>1</b>. This all-layer joining line <b>7</b> is a fusing seal line by heat sealing, ultrasonic sealing or the like, so that the individual layers are fusion-bonded at the all-layer joining line <b>7</b> to be integrated altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the cleaning article <b>1</b> thus constructed has brush portions <b>26</b> at right and left sides on the cleaning face <b>2</b>A of the base sheet <b>2</b>. These brush portions <b>26</b> are formed by an assembly of the strips <b>12</b> of the base sheet <b>2</b>, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b>, the strips <b>17</b> of the sheet <b>5</b> and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the floor, furniture, or the like is wiped with the cleaning side of the cleaning article <b>1</b>, which is shown upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fine dust can be collected by the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> appearing on the outermost face of the cleaning article <b>1</b>, and by the first and second fiber bundle layers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> inside of the brush portions <b>26</b>. Here, the strips <b>12</b> and <b>17</b> exhibit the function to wipe off the dust, and the dust, as wiped off by the strips <b>12</b> and <b>17</b>, can also be trapped by the fiber bundle layers <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, the strips <b>17</b> are interposed between the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>. When the cleaning operations are repeated, therefore, the filaments of the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and the filaments of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> are prevented from being excessively entangled, so that the shape of the brush portions <b>26</b> can be retained for a long term.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, the filaments of the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> and the filaments of the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> are partially joined to the strips <b>12</b> and the strips <b>17</b>, respectively, so that they are prevented from being excessively curled or entangled. Even after a cleaning operation for a long period, therefore, the brush portions <b>26</b> are hardly crushed so that they are excellent in the shape retention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the outer face side of the cleaning article <b>1</b> thus completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base sheet <b>2</b> and the holding sheet <b>8</b>, which are firstly joined at the joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>13</b>, are further joined at the all-layer joining line <b>17</b> which is formed midway between the joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>13</b>. In the holding region on the outer face of the central region <b>2</b><i>a</i>, therefore, there are formed two parallel holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>, each of which is defined between one of the joining lines <b>13</b> and the all-layer joining line <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, the cleaning article <b>1</b> can be held from the outer face side by a holder <b>21</b> of a bifurcated structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This holder <b>21</b> includes bifurcated insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> and a grip portion <b>23</b>. The insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> are inserted into the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>. Thus, the cleaning operation can be performed by holding the grip portion <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is possible to adopt a variety of structures for preventing the cleaning article <b>1</b> from easily coming out of the holder <b>21</b> at the cleaning time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">First, the insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> may be formed on their lower faces with a number of saw-tooth shaped protrusions <b>22</b><i>a</i>, which are arranged finely with sharp edges. With the protrusions <b>22</b><i>a </i>being directed toward the base sheet <b>2</b>, the insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> are inserted into the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>. In this inserted state, the saw-tooth shaped protrusions <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the base sheet <b>2</b> are retained in a high coefficient of friction so that they can prevent the cleaning article <b>1</b> from easily coming out.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is also effective to fix a retaining fastener <b>24</b> on the root end portion of the insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the holder <b>21</b>. This retaining fastener <b>24</b> is formed with fine hook-shaped or mushroom-shaped projections. With the retaining fastener <b>24</b> being retained on the back face <b>2</b>B of the base sheet <b>2</b>, the cleaning article <b>1</b> is prevented from coming out of the holder <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, it is also possible to provide a pivotable connect member <b>25</b> to the leading end portion of one of the bifurcated insert portions <b>22</b>. This connect member <b>25</b> is turned, when the insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> are inserted so far into the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b> that their leading ends pass through and come out of the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>, to thereby retain the connect member <b>25</b> on the leading end of the other insert portion <b>22</b> by engagement between concave and convex, or the like. The prevention of the cleaning article <b>1</b> from coming out of the holder <b>21</b> can also be ensured by this retention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To the holder <b>21</b>, there may be provided all or at least one of the means for preventing the coming-out of the cleaning article <b>1</b> (i.e., all or at least one of the protrusions <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the retaining fastener <b>24</b> and the connect member <b>25</b>). Here, the holder <b>21</b> having such means can be used not only in the cleaning article of the invention but also in any cleaning article.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The cleaning article <b>1</b> thus far described has a symmetrical shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Therefore, if the cleaning article <b>1</b> is used for cleaning operation while being attached to the holder <b>21</b> from the direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and is locally soiled, the cleaning article <b>1</b> may be removed from the holder <b>21</b> and turned 180 degrees from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to be attached to the holder <b>21</b> again. If the cleaning article <b>1</b> is used for cleaning operation by changing its direction thus described above, the individual portions of the cleaning article <b>1</b> can be homogeneously used without any unbalance.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Here, if the insert portions <b>22</b> of the holder <b>21</b> are formed of an easily deformable material, it is possible to bend arbitrarily the shape of the cleaning article <b>1</b> held by the holder <b>21</b>. If the grip portion <b>23</b> is given an extensible structure, on the other hand, the cleaning operation may be performed while the grip portion <b>23</b> being extended long.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here in the cleaning article <b>1</b>, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> is joined to the base sheet <b>2</b> at the joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>13</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, so that the cleaning faces of the insertion portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> to be inserted into the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b> are covered at any time not only with the base sheet <b>2</b> but also with the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>. Therefore, even if the right or left brush portion is unintentionally turned over during cleaning operation, the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> exists at a predetermined sufficient thickness between the object to be cleaned and the insertion portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the holder <b>21</b>. As a result, the object to be cleaned is not affected by the hardness of the holder so that the cleaning article <b>1</b> provides a smooth contact feel when used for cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing a cleaning article <b>1</b>A as a modification of the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The cleaning article <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is prepared by changing the order of laminations of the individual layers of the cleaning article <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this cleaning article <b>1</b>A, there is provided an outermost base sheet <b>15</b> which is formed of a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, and the base sheet <b>2</b> formed of a spun-bonded nonwoven fabric or the like is laid over the cleaning face of the this outermost base sheet <b>15</b>. Over the cleaning face <b>2</b>A of the base sheet <b>2</b>, moreover, there are laid the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b>, the second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b>, the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> and the sheet <b>5</b> sequentially upward. The sheet <b>5</b> is formed with the strips <b>17</b> and appears on the outermost face of the cleaning article <b>1</b>A on its cleaning side. The sheet <b>5</b> may be formed of any suitable material such as a nonwoven fabric or a resin film, but is preferably formed of a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then, the outermost base sheet <b>15</b>, the base sheet <b>2</b> and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> are joined to one another on the same joining lines <b>13</b> and <b>13</b> as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Moreover, all the layers from the outermost base sheet <b>15</b> to the sheet <b>5</b> having the strips <b>17</b> are joined altogether at the same all-layer joining line <b>7</b> as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This all-layer joining line <b>7</b> extends along the center line of the cleaning article <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Here, as in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> and the overlying sheet <b>5</b> may be joined at the joining lines <b>18</b> positioned midway between the longitudinal ends of the strips <b>17</b> so that some of the filaments of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> are partially integrated to the strips <b>17</b>. Moreover, the base sheet <b>2</b> may be formed with the plurality of strips <b>12</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and the strips <b>12</b> and the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> may also be joined at the zigzag joining lines <b>14</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Of course, it is also possible that the holding sheet <b>8</b> is joined to the outer face of the outermost base sheet <b>15</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to form the holding spaces <b>20</b> and <b>20</b> between the outermost base sheet <b>15</b> and the holding sheet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the cleaning article <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sheet <b>5</b> having the strips <b>17</b> is provided to form the outermost face on the cleaning side so that it abuts preferentially against the object to be cleaned, such as floor, furniture or the like. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the filaments of the individual underlying fiber bundle layers <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> from being excessively entangled or massed by the friction with the object to be cleaned. Especially if some of the filaments of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> are joined at the joining lines <b>18</b> to the overlying strips <b>17</b>, they are hardly entangled or massed. If the outermost sheet <b>5</b> is formed of a highly rigid and soft through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, moreover, the brush portions <b>26</b>, as formed of the strips and the fiber bundle layers, are hardly deformed by the friction with the object to be cleaned, so that they hardly lose their shapes even after used for a long term.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the sheet <b>5</b> having the strips <b>17</b> forms the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is the more preferable that the individual strips <b>17</b> are the longer. It is, therefore, preferred that the cut lines <b>16</b> for separating the strips <b>17</b> are extended to or close to the all-layer joining line <b>7</b>. Alternatively, it is also possible that the cut lines <b>16</b> cross the whole area of the sheet <b>5</b> in MD so that the strips <b>17</b> are completely separated from each other before joined to the other layers at the all-layer joining line <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As has been described above, if the strips <b>17</b> formed of the through-air bonded nonwoven fabric are positioned on the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side, as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the brush portions <b>26</b> can reliably retain their shapes even after use of a long term. On the other hand, if the fiber bundle layer is positioned on the outermost face of the cleaning article on its cleaning side, as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, the filaments of the fiber bundle layer are liable to be entangled or massed by the friction with the object to be cleaned for a long term, comparatively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the cleaning article <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, therefore, it is preferred to apply a fixing agent to the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> appearing on the outermost face. Examples of the fixing agent include an oil agent, a wax, and a resin such as a HMA (hot melt adhesive). This fixing agent thus applied can prevent freedom of movement of the filaments (i.e., suppress disaggregation of the filaments) so that the filaments can be prevented from being excessively entangled or massed at the wiping time.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">This fixing agent may be partially applied to the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>. For example, the fixing agent may be sprayed exclusively to the cleaning face of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> thereby to fix the filaments appearing on the cleaning face of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> exclusively. Alternatively, the fixing agent may be applied to the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> over a predetermined length from the all-layer joining line <b>7</b> so that the filaments forming the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> remain free on the side of their free ends. In both cases, the filaments forming the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> can be prevented from being excessively entangled, without lowering the dust trapping effect by the fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>. Preferably, the fixing agent is solid at the room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the case where a wax is used for fixing, for example, the ratio of the wax to the fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> is preferably from 0.5 to 25% by weight. If the ratio is less than 0.5% by weight, the entanglement of the filaments could not be prevented effectively. If more than 25% by weight, on the other hand, the filaments will be excessively firmly fixed. Therefore, since the filaments can not be sufficiently raised, the dust trapping effect is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case where a HMA is used for fixing, this HMA is preferred to have a low viscosity. If a HMA having a high viscosity is used, dust trapping property is enhanced but the filaments are liable to be entangled. Of course, the fixing agent may be prepared by mixing a wax and a HMA having a low viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Here, the entanglement of the filaments may be prevented not by the method of applying the fixing agent to the fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> but by solidifying the filaments of the fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> again after melting them with a solvent or by a heat. In this case, too, it is possible to firmly fix the filaments of the fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> only at the side of the all-layer joining line <b>7</b> to prevent the entanglement, while leaving the degree of freedom at the side of their leading ends so that the filament can be raised easily.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Of course, the fixing of filaments in each fiber bundle layer should not be limited to the cleaning article <b>1</b>. For example, also in the cleaning article <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the filaments in the individual fiber bundle layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> may be fixed to one another with a fixing agent or by fusing them, as has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the cleaning article <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> is joined to the other layers only at the all-layer joining line <b>7</b>. However, it is also possible to form other joining lines spaced apart from the all-layer joining line <b>7</b> to thereby join the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> only to the underlying sheet <b>5</b> or to all the other layers (i.e., from the sheet <b>5</b> to the base sheet <b>2</b>). This can also prevent the filaments of the third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b> from being excessively entangled or massed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In both the cleaning article <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the cleaning article <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is preferable that the basis weight of the first fiber bundle layer <b>3</b> the closest to the base sheet <b>2</b> is larger than those of the overlying second fiber bundle layer <b>4</b> and third fiber bundle layer <b>6</b>. In such a construction, even if the strips or the filaments forming the brush portions <b>26</b> are entangled or massed by repeating the cleaning operations for a long term, the base sheet <b>2</b> is not exposed from the brush portions <b>26</b>. Therefore, the base sheet <b>2</b> can be prevented from coming into direct contact with the object to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view showing a portion of a cleaning article <b>30</b> according to a second embodiment of the invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of the cleaning article <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The cleaning article <b>30</b> comprises sheets <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> formed of a nonwoven fabric or the like, and fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The sheet <b>31</b> has a plurality of strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>formed on its two side portions and elongated in MD. The sheet <b>32</b> laid over the sheet <b>31</b> also has a plurality of strips <b>32</b><i>a </i>formed on its two side portions. These strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>are formed by forming a plurality of cut lines in the two side portions of the individual sheets <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The fiber bundle layer <b>33</b> is disposed on the lower face (cleaning face) of the sheet <b>31</b>; and the fiber bundle layer <b>34</b> is disposed on the upper face (cleaning face) of the sheet <b>32</b>. The sheets <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> and the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> thus laminated are integrally fusion-bonded at a center joining line <b>35</b> and side joining lines <b>36</b> and <b>36</b>. On the outer side portions beyond the side joining lines <b>36</b> and <b>36</b>, there are formed brush portions <b>37</b> and <b>37</b> of assemblies of the strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The two side joining lines <b>36</b> and <b>36</b> define a holding region <b>38</b> therebetween. In the holding region <b>38</b>, two holding spaces <b>39</b> and <b>39</b> separated by the center joining line <b>35</b> are formed between the sheet <b>31</b> and the sheet <b>32</b>. Into those holding spaces <b>39</b> and <b>39</b>, there can be inserted the insert portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the holder <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, a relatively wide, single holding space may be formed between the side joining lines <b>36</b> and <b>36</b> without providing the center joining line <b>35</b>. Here, the holder to be inserted into the wide holding space may be given a flat shape.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the holding region <b>38</b>, moreover, there are formed cut lines <b>41</b> each extending in the direction perpendicular to MD. Midway between adjacent joining lines <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, these cut lines <b>41</b> are arranged intermittently at a predetermined spacing. The sheets <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> and the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are cut altogether at those cut lines <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As a result, on both the upper and lower faces (i.e., two cleaning faces) of the cleaning article <b>30</b>, filaments crossing the cut lines <b>41</b> are cut in the holding region <b>38</b>, thereby to form fiber brush portions <b>42</b> extending from the joining lines <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. On the other hand, filaments not crossing the cut lines <b>41</b> remain uncut in the holding region <b>38</b>, thereby to form fiber bridges <b>43</b> extending between adjacent joining lines <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. These fiber brush portions <b>42</b> and fiber bridges <b>43</b> are alternated in the direction perpendicular to MD.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this cleaning article <b>30</b>, the brush portions <b>37</b> and <b>37</b> on its two side portions are the assemblies of the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and the strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the brush portions <b>37</b> have such high overall rigidities that the strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>can wipe off the dust whereas the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> can trap the dust.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the holding region <b>38</b>, on the other hand, the fiber brush portions <b>42</b>, as formed by cutting the fiber bundle layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> at the cut lines <b>41</b>, can exhibit the function to wipe off the dust, and the fiber bridges <b>43</b> can trap the dust wiped off. Therefore, the cleaning article <b>30</b> can exhibit the cleaning function not only at the brush portions <b>37</b> and <b>37</b> but also at both the upper and lower faces in the holding region <b>38</b>, so that it can perform an effective cleaning operation at any portions.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is also possible to provide other layers <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> between the sheet <b>31</b> and the fiber bundle layer <b>33</b> having the fiber brush portions <b>42</b> and between the sheet <b>32</b> and the fiber bundle layer <b>34</b> having the fiber brush portions <b>42</b>, respectively. These layers <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> are not cut at the cut lines <b>41</b> and may be formed of a fiber bundle having a large basis weight or a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view showing a cleaning article <b>50</b> according to a third embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this cleaning article <b>50</b>, two side portions of a sheet <b>51</b> are cut at a plurality of cut lines to form a plurality of strips <b>51</b><i>a</i>, and two side portions of a sheet <b>52</b> are cut likewise to form a plurality of strips <b>52</b><i>a</i>. On the lower face of the sheet <b>51</b>, there is disposed a fiber bundle layer <b>53</b>, and on the upper face of the sheet <b>52</b>, there is disposed a fiber bundle layer <b>54</b>. The sheet <b>51</b>, the sheet <b>52</b>, the fiber bundle layer <b>53</b> and the fiber bundle layer <b>54</b> are integrally fusion-bonded at joining lines <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> extending in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">On the two side portions beyond the joining lines <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, there are formed brush portions <b>57</b> of assemblies of the strips <b>51</b><i>a</i>, the strips <b>52</b><i>a</i>, the fiber bundle layer <b>53</b> and the fiber bundle layer <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The joining line <b>55</b> and the joining line <b>56</b> define a holding space between the sheet <b>51</b> and the sheet <b>52</b>. Into this holding space, there is inserted a holder <b>61</b>. At this time, if the cleaning article <b>50</b> is attached to the holder <b>61</b> while being twisted, the brush portions <b>57</b> can be deformed to extend helically.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this cleaning article <b>50</b>, the brush portions <b>57</b> are directed in all directions around the holder <b>61</b>. Therefore, the cleaning article <b>50</b> can effectively trap dust when used to clean a narrow gap or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Here, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be given a structure in which a fiber bundle layer is further clamped between the strips <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the sheet <b>31</b> and the strips <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the sheet <b>32</b>. Likewise, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may also be given a structure in which a fiber bundle layer is further clamped between the strips <b>51</b><i>a </i>of the sheet <b>51</b> and the strips <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the sheet <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>, moreover, the strips and the fiber bundle layers may be partially joined to one another midway between the longitudinal ends of the strips.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the foregoing individual embodiments, if the fiber bundle layers are formed of crimped fibers, the fibers themselves can trap the dust easily. If the fibers (e.g., filaments opened from a tow or split yarns) are joined to the sheet while being stretched in MD, and are then cut together with the sheet, moreover, the fibers are crimped so that the portions of the fiber bundle layer forming the brush portions become shorter than the strips. In this construction, it is possible to enhance both the dust trapping function by the crimped fibers and the dust wiping function by the strips extending beyond the free ends of the crimped fibers, so that the cleaning function can be effectively exhibited by the assembly of the fibers and the strips.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Moreover, the dust adsorbing and trapping effect can be enhanced by applying a dust-adsorbing agent to the fiber bundle layers and/or the strips. This dust-adsorbing agent is exemplified by a surface-active agent, mineral oil or wax. It is also possible to apply an acrylic adhesive or a hot melt adhesive which has a weakened adhesion.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The fiber bundle layers and/or the strips may further contain a substance such as a deodorant, a humectant or an anti-fungus agent in addition to the dust-adsorbing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">If the sheets in the individual embodiments are given an elastic stretchability between the joining lines formed in the holding region, moreover, the sheets can make close contact with the holder when the cleaning article is attached to the holder, so that the cleaning article hardly comes out of the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the individual embodiments, the nonwoven fabric to be used to form the sheets having the strips should not be limited to one formed by the spun-bonding process or the through-air bonding process, but may be formed by the thermal bonding, spun-lacing, point-bonding, melt-blowing, stitch bonding, chemical bonding, needle punching or the like. Moreover, the nonwoven fabric may be replaced by a material to be worked into the strips, such as urethane, sponge, a woven fabric, a net or a split cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Where the sheets having the strips are formed of a nonwoven fabric, the nonwoven fabric is preferred to have a basis weight of 10 to 100 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and a thickness of 0.5 to 5 mm, from the point of view of handleability when combined with the fiber bundle layers and from the point of view of processing technique. Moreover, the nonwoven fabric is preferred to have a width of 80 to 250 mm in MD.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As has been described above, the cleaning article of the invention has a brush portion formed of strips and a fiber bundle layer, so that the fibers of the fiber bundle layer can be prevented from being excessively entangled or curled, thereby to enhance the shape retention of the brush portion. Especially, if the strips and the fiber bundle layer are partially joined to one another, the fiber bundle layer forming the brush portion can be enhanced in rigidity and can be prevented from being curled or shrunken even after use of a long term.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Although various exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown. Therefore, the scope of the invention is intended to be limited solely by the scope of the claims that follow.</p>
