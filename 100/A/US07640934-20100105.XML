<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An infant nasal interface prong device for use with an nCPAP system. The device includes first and second nasal prongs and a base. Each prong includes a bellows segment, a tip, and a lumen. The tip extends from the bellows segment to a tip end and is adapted for insertion with an infant's naris. The lumen extends through the tip and the bellows segment. In an undeflected state, a central axis of the lumen along the bellows segment is transversely offset from the lumen axis at the tip end. The base is connected to each of the nasal prongs and is adapted for coupling to a CPAP generator. The bellows segment renders the corresponding prong highly flexible relative to the base.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to patient nasal interface devices for use with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems. More particularly, it relates to a nasal interface prong device for delivering CPAP therapy to the nasal airways of a patient, such as an infant.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">CPAP therapy has been employed for many years to treat patients experiencing respiratory difficulties and/or insufficiencies. More recently, CPAP therapy has been advanced as being useful in assisting patients with under-developed lungs (in particular, infants and especially premature infants or neonates) by preventing lung collapse during exhalation and assisting lung expansion during inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general terms, CPAP therapy entails the continuous transmission of positive pressure into the lungs of a spontaneously breathing patient throughout the respiratory cycle. A CPAP system generally includes a CPAP generator adapted to create or generate a continuous positive airway pressure within one or two tubes, along with a patient interface device connected to the generator that serves as a conduit for transfer of inhaled and exhaled gases. The CPAP generator can assume a variety of forms, including a fixed flow, ventilator-type system, or a variable flow system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Similarly, CPAP can be delivered to the patient using a variety of patient interface devices, for example an endotracheal tube. With infants, however, it is desirable to employ a less invasive patient interface device, in particular one that interfaces directly or indirectly with the nasal airways via the patient's nares. Such systems are commonly referred to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (&#x201c;nCPAP&#x201d;) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With nCPAP systems, the patient nasal interface device is typically either a mask or a dual prong body. The nasal mask is characterized as defining a single cavity that is placed over the patient's nose. The cavity is fluidly connected to the CPAP generator and thus provides a conduit between the CPAP generator and the patient's nasal airways. While non-invasive, it is sometimes difficult to consistently achieve and maintain a fluid-tight seal between the mask cavity and the nasal airways. This is especially true with infants whom otherwise have smaller facial features and thus facial surface area against which the mask can be applied. Conversely, the dual prong device includes two prongs or cannulas each fluidly connected to the CPAP generator and sized for insertion within a respective naris of the patient. With this technique, a relatively stable fluid seal can readily be accomplished between the prongs and the nasal airways. Unfortunately, however, the inventors have discovered several possible shortcomings with currently available infant CPAP nasal interface prong devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, nasal interface prong devices are designed to satisfy an overriding goal of achieving and maintaining a fluid seal within the patient's nares. The conventional approach for ensuring a fluid seal is to form the prongs to be somewhat soft, along with having an enlarged diameter along a portion of a length thereof (e.g., a flared tip end or enlarged tip base). This enlarged diameter essentially presses into or lodges against the patient's naris tissue/membrane upon insertion. To this end, though soft, conventional prong configurations have little or no mobility (e.g., cannot axially compress or move laterally), leading to distinct pressure points along the tip end/naris interface. For many patients, especially infants, this interaction can be quite painful, causing the patient to resist insertion of the nasal prongs and/or long-term usage. In fact, the delicate tissue associated with the patient's nares (and especially a premature infant's nares) can be damaged by long-term contact with the nasal prongs, resulting in pressure sores and even necrosis. Unfortunately, simply softening the prong material is not a viable solution, as it may lead to kinking of the prong(s) during use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Along these same lines, the immobile nature of the conventional nasal interface prong device cannot accommodate any misalignment of the CPAP generator relative to the patient's nose. When the CPAP generator is later moved relative to the patient to correct this misalignment, the nasal interface prong device will also move in a similar fashion, again potentially leading to painful pressure points within the patient's nares. While efforts have been made to incorporate a flexible segment into the nasal prong design, (e.g., Landis, U.S. Publication No. 2004/0065330), other concerns arise, such as kinking of the flexible section or insufficient lateral resistance to prong collapse during insertion within the naris. Further, with other attempts (e.g., Trimble et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,782,932), human nasal anatomy has not been fully addressed, nor have the anatomical peculiarities commonly encountered with infants been accounted for. For example, the nasal septum is under-developed in many infants, and in particular premature infants. This, in turn, dramatically affects the uniformity of a particular naris diameter. Because available flexible nasal prong designs cannot self-correct for the naris diameter actually encountered, it is necessary to have a relatively large number of differently-sized nasal prong devices on hand. As might be expected, healthcare facilities would greatly prefer to not maintain a large inventory of differently-sized products; similarly, physicians may find it difficult and time consuming to select the optimal nasal prong device from a large number of available sizes through trial-and-error.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the above, a need exists for an improved nasal interface prong device for use with an nCPAP system, especially for infant patient applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some aspects in accordance with principles of the present invention relate to an infant nasal interface prong device for use with a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) system. The device includes first and second nasal prongs and a base. Each prong includes a bellows segment, a tip, and a lumen. The tip extends from the bellows segment and is adapted for insertion with an infant's naris. Further, the tip terminates in a tip end opposite the bellows segment. The lumen extends through the tip and the bellows segment. In an undeflected state, a central axis of the lumen as defined by the bellows segment is transversely offset from a central axis of the lumen as defined at the tip end. The base is connected to each of the nasal prongs and is adapted for coupling to a CPAP generator. In addition, the base defines first and second passages fluidly connected to respective ones of the lumens. With this configuration, the bellows segment renders the corresponding prong highly flexible such that the respective tips radially pivot relative to the base. Further, the offset positioning of the tip end relative to the bellows segment promotes desired positioning of the base, and thus of a CPAP generator assembled thereto, relative to the patient while at the same time more closely conforming to the expected nasal anatomy. In one embodiment, the tip is curved in longitudinal extension from the bellows segment. In another embodiment, the bellows segment is characterized by a reduced wall thickness as compared to a wall thickness of the tip, and is configured to impart an inward bias onto the tip.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects in accordance with principles of the present invention relate to an infant nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) device for use in an nCPAP system. The device includes an nCPAP generator and an infant nasal interface prong device. The nCPAP generator includes first and second tubes, and is adapted to generate a continuous positive airway pressure within each of the tubes. The infant nasal interface device is mounted to the tubes and includes first and second prongs, and a base. Each of the prongs includes a bellows segment, a tip, and a lumen. The tip extends from the bellows segment and is adapted for insertion within an infant's naris. Further, the tip terminates in a tip end opposite the bellows segment. The lumen extends through the tip and the bellows segment such that in an undeflected state, a central lumen axis along the bellows segment is transversely offset from the central lumen axis at the tip end. The base, in turn, is connected to each of the nasal prongs and is coupled to the CPAP generator. In this regard, the base defines first and second passages each fluidly connected to a respective one of the lumens. Further, the passages are fluidly connected to respective ones of the tubes upon final assembly. In one embodiment, the base of the interface device and a housing of the CPAP generator define corresponding, non-symmetrical shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet other aspects in accordance with principles of the present invention relate to an infant nasal interface prong device for use with an nCPAP system. The device includes first and second prongs and a base. Each prong includes a bellows segment, a tip, and a lumen. The tip is adapted for insertion within an infant's naris and has a tip body extending from the bellows segment and terminating at a tip end. Further, the tip body defines a top side forming a convex curve in longitudinal extension and a bottom side forming a concave curve in longitudinal extension. The lumen extends through the prong and is open at the tip end. With this in mind, in an undeflected state of the prong, a central axis of the lumen as defined by the bellows segment is transversely offset from the central axis of the lumen as defined at the tip end. The base is connected to each of the nasal prongs and is adapted for coupling to a CPAP generator. In addition, the base defines first and second passages fluidly connected to respective ones of the lumens. In this regard, the prongs extend in a juxtaposed fashion relative to the base. The bellows segment of each prong is configured to be non-symmetrical relative to an axis of the corresponding tip.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One embodiment of an infant nasal interface prong device <b>20</b> for use with a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The interface device <b>20</b> includes a first prong <b>22</b>, a second prong <b>24</b>, and a base <b>26</b>. Details on the various components are provided below. In general terms, however, the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> extend in a generally juxtaposed fashion from the base <b>26</b>, and each define a lumen <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> (referenced generally), respectively. The base <b>26</b> is configured to establish a fluid connection between an nCPAP generator (shown at <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) and the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. To this end, the first and second prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are each configured for insertion within a patient's naris. Further, the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are adapted to be highly flexible, allowing for longitudinal movement and lateral/transverse pivoting relative to the base <b>26</b> without collapsing of the corresponding lumen <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. As such, the patient interface device <b>20</b> readily accommodates any slight misalignments upon securement to the patient, whereby a tip portion of each of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> effectively&#x201c;floats&#x201d; relative to the base <b>26</b>. As described below, in some embodiments, the interface device <b>20</b> incorporates additional features that further reduce possible patient discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used throughout the specification, relative directional terminology, such as&#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and&#x201c;distal&#x201d; are used with reference to a position of the interface device <b>20</b> relative to a patient to whom the interface device <b>20</b> is applied. Thus, &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; is closer to the patient as compared&#x201c;distal&#x201d;. Further, spatial terminology, such as &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; etc., are with reference to an upright orientation of the device <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but are in no way limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The interface device <b>20</b> is preferably an integral, homogenous structure, formed of a surgically safe, compliant material capable of achieving a fluid seal when applied to a patient's skin and nares. For example, and in one embodiment, the interface device <b>20</b> is a molded silicone part. Alternatively, other materials such as soft vinyls, thermoplastic elastomers, etc., are also acceptable. However, reference to certain dimensional attributes in the following discussion relates to one embodiment in which the interface device <b>20</b>, and in particular each of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, is a homogenous, thin-walled structure formed of silicone or silicone-like material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With the above general parameters in mind and with specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in one embodiment each of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is defined by or includes a tip <b>40</b>, a bellows segment <b>42</b>, and a foot <b>44</b>. The prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> extend in a generally juxtaposed fashion from the base <b>26</b>, and are identical. Thus, the following description of the first prong <b>22</b> applies equally to the second prong <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The lumen <b>28</b> extends through the tip <b>40</b>, the bellows segment <b>42</b>, and the foot <b>44</b>, such that the prong <b>22</b> is a generally tubular body defining a lumen central axis A (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). A spatial orientation of the lumen central axis A varies between the tip <b>40</b>, the bellows segment <b>42</b>, and the foot <b>44</b>, with these variations being reflected in the figures as A<sub>tip</sub>, A<sub>bellows</sub>, and A<sub>foot </sub>. As described below, the variation in spatial orientation of the central lumen axis A occurs both horizontally (reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and vertically (reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) relative to an upright position of the interface device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tip <b>40</b> extends proximally from the bellows segment <b>42</b>, and terminates at a tip end <b>46</b> opposite the bellows segment <b>42</b>. As further shown in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the tip end <b>46</b> is flared relative to a remainder of the tip <b>40</b>. That is to say, in one embodiment the tip end <b>46</b> defines a proximally increasing outer diameter for more readily engaging or contacting a surface of the patient's naris upon insertion of the tip <b>40</b> within the naris. Further, and in one embodiment, a cross-sectional wall thickness of the tip end <b>46</b> is decreased as compared to a wall thickness of the remainder of the tip body <b>40</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. That is to say, the tip <b>40</b> can be described as including the tip end <b>46</b> and a tip body <b>48</b>, with the prong <b>22</b> being formed by a continuous side wall <b>50</b>. With these definitions in mind, the side wall <b>50</b> tapers in thickness (proximally) along the tip end <b>46</b> to a thickness that is at least 25% less than a maximum nominal thickness of the side wall <b>50</b> along the tip body <b>48</b>. This reduced wall thickness renders the tip end <b>46</b> highly compliant and thus less likely to create pressure points when pressed against an interior of the patient's naris.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A spatial orientation of the tip body <b>48</b> is dictated by an arrangement of the corresponding bellows segment <b>42</b>/foot <b>44</b> as described below, with the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> being arranged to each generally define an interior side <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and an exterior side <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the first prong <b>22</b> &#x201c;faces&#x201d; the interior side <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the second prong <b>24</b> (and vice-versa); the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>or <b>54</b><i>b </i>is defined opposite the corresponding interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>or <b>52</b><i>b</i>. With this in mind, the tip bodies <b>48</b> are, in one embodiment, configured in combination with spatial orientation dictated by the bellows segment <b>42</b>/foot <b>44</b> such that the interior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>along the tip bodies <b>48</b> are substantially parallel (e.g., with 5 degrees of a true parallel relationship), whereas the exterior sides <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>along the tip bodies <b>48</b> taper slightly toward one another in proximal extension. For example, a lateral distance between the interior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>at the corresponding tip body <b>48</b>/bellows segment <b>42</b> intersection is substantially the same as a lateral distance at the tip body <b>48</b>/tip end <b>46</b> intersection; conversely, a lateral distance between the exterior sides <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>decreases from the corresponding tip body <b>48</b>/bellows segment <b>42</b> intersection to the tip body <b>48</b>/tip end <b>46</b> intersection. This one configuration of the tip bodies <b>48</b> establishes a first septal relief zone <b>56</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) that limits possible formation of pressure points along the patient's septum (that is otherwise between the interior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the tip bodies <b>48</b> upon insertion of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>) due to the substantially parallel relationship. Instead, primary contact (preferably all contact) between the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the patient's septum occurs only at the tip ends <b>46</b>. For neonates having underdeveloped septums, this absence of pressure points essentially eliminates a recognized cause of septal necrosis found with use of conventional nasal prong devices. Conversely, the tapered relationship (relative to a true parallel relationship) established by. the exterior sides <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>conforms to the expected naris anatomy (e.g., nasal orifice and nasal entrance). Alternatively, the tip bodies <b>48</b> can assume other shapes relative to the interior and/or exterior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An additional feature of the tip <b>40</b> in accordance with one embodiment is best reflected in the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. To this end, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> depict the interface device <b>20</b> in an &#x201c;upright&#x201d; orientation whereby the prong <b>22</b> can be described as having or defining a top side <b>60</b> (referenced generally) and a bottom side <b>62</b> (referenced generally). Relative to the patient's anatomy, upon insertion into the naris, the top side <b>60</b> will reside closer to the patient's nasal bridge as compared to the bottom side <b>62</b>; conversely, the bottom side <b>62</b> will reside more closely to the patient's upper lip as compared to the top side <b>60</b>. With these conventions in mind, the tip body <b>48</b> defines a longitudinal curvature that approximates the expected naris anatomy, and further positions the base <b>26</b>, and thus the nCPAP generator (not shown) otherwise attached to the base <b>26</b>, at a desired position relative to the patient (i.e., off of the patient's face). For example, in one embodiment, a proximal region <b>66</b> of the tip body <b>48</b> has, in longitudinal (proximal) extension relative to the bellows segment <b>42</b>, a convex curvature along the top side <b>60</b> and a concave curvature along the bottom side <b>62</b>. In one embodiment, a radius of curvature associated with the proximal region top side <b>60</b> differs from that associated with the proximal region bottom side <b>62</b>, with the proximal region top side <b>60</b> having a larger radius of curvature. Alternatively, the radius of curvature of the proximal region <b>66</b> can be uniform. Even further, in other embodiments, the tip body <b>48</b> exterior is linear in longitudinal extension. Along these same lines, in one embodiment, the central axis A of the lumen <b>28</b> as defined by the tip body <b>48</b> (i.e., A<sub>tip</sub>) is arcuate or curved relative to a side plane (or vertical, longitudinal cross-section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) of the device <b>20</b>; alternatively, the central axis A<sub>tip </sub>can be linear.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Regardless, longitudinal extension of the tip body <b>48</b> from the bellows segment <b>42</b> includes a transverse or radial component, such that the tip end <b>46</b> is transversely offset (e.g., vertically above) relative to the bellows segment <b>42</b> in the upright orientation of the interface device <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. In one embodiment, this vertical offset is characterized by the central axis A of the lumen <b>28</b> along the bellows segment <b>42</b> (i.e., A<sub>bellows</sub>) being transversely or vertically offset relative to the central axis A of the lumen <b>28</b> at the tip end <b>46</b> (in longitudinal, side planar view of the device <b>20</b>). The vertical offset can alternatively be characterized relative to the tip body <b>48</b>. More particularly, the tip end <b>46</b> defines a lumen center point C<sub>end</sub>. Similarly, the tip body <b>48</b> defines a lumen center point C<sub>body </sub>at the intersection with the bellows segment <b>42</b> (i.e., a trailing end of the tip body <b>48</b>). Relative to the upright orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the tip end center point C<sub>end </sub>is transversely above the tip body center point C<sub>body</sub>. As a point of reference, as described below the bellows segment <b>42</b> is flexible, such that the tip <b>40</b> can pivot or deflect relative to the foot <b>44</b> with the bellows segment <b>42</b> internally flexing or deflecting. Thus, spatial relationships or attributes described herein are relative to the prong <b>22</b> in an undeflected or natural state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The bellows segment <b>42</b> extends distally from the tip <b>40</b>, and is configured to permit and facilitate pivoting and/or flexing of the tip <b>40</b> relative to the foot <b>44</b> (and relative to the base <b>26</b>). The flexibility afforded by the bellows segment <b>42</b> can be accomplished with a variety of designs. For example, the bellows segment <b>42</b> is configured such that the tip <b>40</b> can pivot in a multitude of directions relative to the foot <b>44</b> and/or base <b>26</b> (e.g., vertically up or down, horizontally side-to-side, etc.), move distally toward the foot <b>44</b>/base <b>26</b> (via collapsing of the bellows segment <b>42</b>), etc. In one embodiment, however, the bellows segment <b>42</b> is configured to allow pivoting or swiveling of the tip <b>40</b> with minimal force and without kinking (i.e., the bellows segment <b>42</b> does not overtly collapse or fold over in a manner that would otherwise result in a substantial increase in flow resistance). To better understand this feature, a brief explanation of certain spatial features associated with the foot <b>44</b> and the base <b>26</b> is helpful.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As previously described, the base <b>26</b> facilitates assembly of the patient interface device <b>20</b> to an nCPAP generator (shown at <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), and defines a distal or rear face <b>70</b>. The rear face <b>70</b> abuts against a corresponding surface of the nCPAP generator, and thus defines a plane relative to which portions of the patient interface device <b>20</b> can be compared or described. In addition, the base <b>26</b> forms first and second passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> that are fluidly connected to respective ones of the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In this regard, fluid connection between the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, respectively, is achieved at an interface or transition of the respective foot <b>44</b> and the base <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the above conventions in mind, and with specific reference to the longitudinal cross-sectional bottom view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in one embodiment, the bellows segment <b>42</b> is formed via the side wall <b>50</b> defining first, second, and third sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b>. The first section <b>90</b> extends proximally from the foot <b>44</b> to define a first bend angle W. The second section <b>92</b> extends proximally from the first section <b>90</b> to define a second bend angle X. The third section <b>94</b> extends proximally from the second section <b>92</b> to define a third bend angle Y. Finally, the third section <b>94</b> and the tip body <b>48</b> combine to define a fourth bend angle Z. In general terms and in one embodiment, the sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b> combine to define a single outboard wall segment (at the intersection of the second and third sections <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>) and do not include or define an annular trough.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A transverse plane defined at an intersection of the first section <b>90</b> and the foot <b>44</b> is non-parallel relative to the plane of the rear face <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. That is to say, the interior side <b>80</b> at the first section <b>90</b>/foot <b>44</b> intersection is longitudinally closer to the rear face <b>70</b> as compared to the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>at the first section <b>90</b>/foot <b>44</b> intersection. This characteristic is alternatively described by the interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the foot <b>44</b> having a longitudinal length less than that of the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the foot <b>44</b>. Regardless, proximal extension of the first section <b>90</b> relative to the foot <b>44</b> imparts an inward &#x201c;tilt&#x201d; onto the bellows segment <b>42</b>. Further, the first bend angle W varies about a circumference or perimeter of the first section <b>90</b>. More particularly, the first bend angle W is greater at the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>as compared to the interior side <b>52</b><i>a</i>, and is greater than 180&#xb0; at least along the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>such that as a whole, the first section <b>90</b> projects radially inwardly (relative to the central axis A of the lumen <b>28</b>) in longitudinal (proximal) extension from the foot <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A spatial orientation of the second section <b>92</b> relative to the first section <b>90</b> continues the above-described inward &#x201c;tilt&#x201d;, with the exterior side <b>82</b> at the second section <b>92</b>/first section <b>90</b> intersection being longitudinally further from the rear face <b>70</b> as compared to the interior side <b>80</b> at the second section <b>92</b>/first section <b>90</b> intersection. In one embodiment, the second bend angle X is substantially uniform about a circumference or perimeter of the first section <b>90</b>/second section <b>92</b> intersection, but in alternative embodiments can vary. Regardless, the second bend angle X is less than 180&#xb0;, preferably less than 120&#xb0;, and even more preferably less than 90&#xb0;, such that the second section <b>92</b> projects radially outwardly in longitudinal (proximal) extension from the first section <b>90</b>. This, in turn, results in the lumen <b>28</b> having an increasing diameter relative to a longitudinal (proximal) extension of the second section <b>92</b> from the first section <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A spatial orientation and configuration of the third section <b>94</b> relative to the second section <b>92</b> compensates for the planar offset described above. In particular, the third bend angle Y, as defined by the proximal extension of the third section <b>94</b> from the second section <b>92</b>, varies along a circumference or perimeter of the second section <b>92</b>/third section <b>94</b> intersection, with the third bend angle Y being greater along the exterior side <b>82</b> as compared to the interior side <b>80</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the third bend angle Y along the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>approaches 270&#xb0;, whereas the third bend angle Y along the interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>is approximately 210&#xb0;. Alternatively, other dimensional relationships are equally acceptable; preferably, however, an entirety of the third bend angle Y is greater than 180&#xb0; such that the third section <b>94</b> projects radially inward with longitudinal (proximal) extension from the second section <b>92</b>. In other words, the third section <b>94</b> defines the lumen <b>28</b> to have a proximally decreasing diameter. As a result of this spatial orientation, a longitudinal distance of the third section <b>94</b>/tip body <b>48</b> interface relative to the rear face <b>70</b> is substantially uniform at the interior and exterior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Finally, the fourth bend angle Z as defined by the third section <b>94</b> and the tip body <b>48</b>, varies about a circumference of the prong <b>22</b>. More particularly, in one embodiment, the fourth bend angle Z is preferably greater along the interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>as compared to the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a</i>. As a result, and relative to the bottom longitudinal view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the tip body <b>48</b> extends in a generally perpendicular fashion relative to a plane of the rear face <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above-described bellows segment sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b> and bend angles X-Z (and primarily, in one embodiment, the second and third section <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> and the second bend angle X) combine to allow the bellows segment <b>42</b> to repeatedly pivot or swivel in virtually any direction as well as compress longitudinally, all without kinking. In addition, the bellows segments <b>42</b> collectively maintain the interior side<b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>lateral spacing described above with respect to the tip bodies <b>48</b> so as to avoid overt contact with the patent's septum. With respect to the spatial orientation attribute, the first passage <b>72</b> formed by the base <b>26</b> defines a passage axis P. Relative to the passage axis P, the central axis of the foot <b>44</b> (A<sub>foot</sub>) projects laterally outwardly with proximal extension of the foot <b>44</b> from the base <b>26</b>. Conversely, the central axis of the bellows segment <b>42</b> (A<sub>bellows</sub>) projects laterally inwardly with proximal extension of the bellows segment <b>42</b> from the foot <b>44</b>. Finally, the central axis of the tip <b>44</b> (A<sub>tip</sub>) projects primarily longitudinally (relative to a horizontal plane) with proximal extension of the tip <b>40</b> from the bellows segment <b>42</b>. Thus, the tip <b>40</b> is laterally offset relative to bellows segment <b>42</b>, with a majority of the bellows segment <b>42</b> surface area residing at the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>(compared to the interior side <b>52</b><i>a</i>). Thus, the bellows segment <b>42</b> can be described as being non-symmetrical in one or more respects. For example, the bellows segment <b>42</b> is non-symmetrical relative to the central tip axis A<sub>tip</sub>. Further, an exterior shape of the bellows segment <b>42</b> is non-symmetrical relative to the central bellows segment axis A<sub>bellows</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Inward deflection or pivoting of the tip <b>44</b> is facilitated primarily by the second section <b>92</b> compressing toward the first section <b>90</b> along the interior side <b>52</b><i>a</i>, and expanding away from the first section <b>90</b> along the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>(via the second bend angle X); a converse relationship occurs with outward deflection. The enhanced thickness and angular relationship of the second and third sections <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> along the exterior side <b>54</b><i>a </i>ensures that this pivoting movement occurs without kinking and provides continuous support to the desired longitudinal extension of the tip <b>40</b>. That is to say, by forming the bellows segment <b>42</b> to include laterally outwardly extending sections (as compared to a reduced thickness, longitudinal or annular trough), the bellows segment <b>42</b> provides a degree of lateral resistance to compression so that the tip <b>40</b> can be inserted through a nasal opening without collapsing. Conversely, while the bellows segment <b>42</b> along the interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>also permits low force-induced pivoting, a structural mass is of a reduced size so as to maximize the lateral distance between the interior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>. Thus, a second septal relief zone <b>100</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) is established between the bellows segments <b>42</b> as a continuation of the first septal relief zone <b>56</b> (established between the tip bodies <b>48</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above-described configuration of the bellows segment <b>42</b> results in the prong <b>22</b> being able to accommodate for unexpected anatomical configurations of, or deviations in, the patient's septum during use. When the tip <b>40</b> inserted within the patient's naris, the bellows segment <b>42</b> essentially causes the tip <b>40</b>, and in particular the tip end <b>46</b>, to search for the septum or interior region of the naris via the inward angular orientation, and maintains a seal against the septum. In alternative embodiments, however, the bellows segment <b>42</b> can assume a variety of other configurations. For example, the bellows segment <b>42</b> can have or define more or less than three of the sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b>, and the bend angles W-Z can differ from that previously described. Further, the sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b> and/or the bend angles W-Z can be selected to create a directional bias within the bellows segment <b>42</b> whereby the bellows segment <b>42</b> more readily deflects in one direction as compared to another. In other embodiments, and as shown for example by the alternative embodiment infant nasal interface prong device <b>20</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, one or more ribs <b>102</b> can be formed adjacent or along the bellows segment <b>42</b>. The ribs <b>102</b> provide a tactile indication when the bellows segment <b>42</b> is overtly compressed or collapsed, otherwise implicating naris insertion complications (e.g., the ribs <b>102</b> resist further contraction when contacted, and can &#x201c;force&#x201d; the bellow segment <b>42</b> to revert back toward an uncompressed state). The ribs <b>102</b> can assume a variety of forms, and can be provided at various locations along one or both of the foot <b>44</b> and/or the bellows segment <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Returning to the device <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to further enhance a flexibility of the bellows segment <b>42</b>, in one embodiment at least a portion of the bellows segment <b>42</b> is characterized by a reduced thickness of the side wall <b>50</b> as compared to a thickness of the side wall <b>50</b> along the tip body <b>48</b> and the base <b>26</b>. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in one embodiment an entirety of the bellows segment <b>42</b>, including the first, second, and third sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b>, are each characterized by a wall thickness that is much less than that of the base <b>26</b>. Further, at least portions of the first, second, and third sections <b>90</b>-<b>94</b> have a wall thickness less than that of the tip body <b>48</b>. For example, in one embodiment, at least a portion of the bellows segment <b>42</b> (e.g., the first and second segment <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> in regions of one or both of the interior and exterior sides <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>a</i>) has a wall thickness that is at least 25% less than a maximum nominal wall thickness of the tip body <b>48</b>. Regardless, by forming at least a portion of the bellows segment <b>42</b> to have a reduced wall thickness as compared to the base <b>26</b> and the tip body <b>48</b>, an overall flexibility of the bellows segment <b>42</b> is enhanced, yet the base <b>26</b> and the tip body <b>48</b> are provided with sufficient structural strength and rigidity to maintain the prong <b>22</b> (or <b>24</b>) in a desired shape and orientation during naris insertion and delivery of CPAP therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As previously described, the foot <b>44</b> extends from the base <b>26</b> and positions the bellows segment <b>42</b> (and thus the tip body <b>48</b>) at a desired angular orientation relative to the rear face <b>70</b> of the base <b>26</b>. In addition, and in one embodiment, the foot <b>44</b> of the first prong <b>22</b> combines with the foot <b>44</b> of the second prong <b>24</b> to continue the second septal relief zone (designated at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) described above. More particularly, relative to the bottom planar view, the interior side <b>52</b><i>a </i>at the foot <b>44</b> includes a radial outward component in proximal extension from the base <b>26</b>. This, in turn, establishes a transverse spacing between the respective feet <b>44</b>, resulting in a third septal relief zone <b>104</b> (referenced generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The third septal relief zone <b>104</b> minimizes overt contact with the patient's nasal septal area (as well as the exterior skin thereof) upon insertion of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> within the patient's nares, thus minimizing skin breakdown in this delicate area and increasing patient comfort. In one embodiment, the septal relief zones <b>56</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> are collectively configured such that a minimum lateral distance between the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is established at the tip ends <b>46</b>. Alternatively, the foot <b>44</b> can assume a variety of other configurations, in fact, in some alternative embodiments, the foot <b>44</b> is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 4</figref>, the base <b>26</b> extends from the feet <b>44</b> and, as previously described, forms the first and second passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, as well as a channel <b>110</b>. Once again, the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> extend in a longitudinal fashion through a thickness of the base <b>26</b>, and are fluidly connected to respective ones of the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. As described in greater detail below, the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are sized for assembly over corresponding components of a CPAP generator device (shown at <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), and thus are open relative to the rear face <b>70</b> of the base <b>26</b>. Thus, the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> provide mechanisms for fluidly connecting the CPAP generator device to the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. The channel <b>110</b> extends between, and is fluidly connected to, the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. In addition, while the channel <b>110</b> is open at the rear face <b>70</b>, the channel <b>110</b> is not directly fluidly connected to the lumens <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. As described in greater detail below, the channel <b>110</b> is sized and shaped in accordance with certain features of one embodiment CPAP generator, and facilitates sampling or tapping of pressure within the device. Thus, the channel <b>110</b> can assume a wide variety of forms in terms of size, shape, etc. In fact, in alternative embodiments, the channel <b>110</b> is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The base <b>26</b> is, in one embodiment, sized and shaped for interfacing with a corresponding component of a CPAP generator (shown at <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) and fluidly connecting the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to the CPAP generator device. In this regard, an exterior of the base <b>26</b> defines a perimeter <b>120</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that includes opposing first and second side edges <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and opposing first and second end edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. In one embodiment, a perimeter shape of an intersection or transition of the first side edge <b>122</b> to each of the end edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> differs from the perimeter shape of the transition or intersection of the second side edge <b>124</b> with the end edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. For example, in one embodiment, a transition of the second side edge <b>124</b> to each of the end edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> is characterized as being arcuate or curved in perimeter shape, having a relatively large radius of curvature. In contrast, a transition of the first side edge <b>122</b> to each of the end edges <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> is characterized as defining a relatively distinct corner, having a radius of curvature that is less than that of the second side edge <b>124</b>/end edge <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> transitions. Thus, a lateral length of the first side edge <b>122</b> is greater than that of the second side edge <b>124</b>. This one preferred configuration of the perimeter <b>120</b> corresponds with the feature(s) of the CPAP generator device (described below) so as to ensure a desired, proper orientation of the base <b>26</b>, and thus of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, relative to the CPAP generator device upon final assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a portion of one embodiment CPAP generator device <b>150</b> with which the patient interface device <b>20</b> is useful in accordance with principles of the present invention. Details on the generator device <b>150</b> are provided in U.S. application Ser. No. ______ entitled &#x201c;Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Device and System,&#x201d; filed on even date herewith and having attorney docket number RT-6274, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. In general terms, the CPAP generator device <b>150</b> includes first and second tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> laterally surrounded by a housing <b>156</b> and fluidly connected to a fluid supply port <b>158</b>. During use, the CPAP generator device <b>150</b> receives fluid flow via the support port <b>158</b> and generates a continuous positive airway pressure within each of the tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. With these general concepts in mind, the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the base <b>26</b> are sized for mating over a respective one of the tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, and the base <b>26</b> is sized for being received and frictionally retained within the housing <b>156</b>. In this regard, an interior perimeter shape of the housing <b>156</b> corresponds with the perimeter <b>120</b> of the base <b>26</b> as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, the differing lengths of the side edges <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, as well as the curved and corner-shaped transition regions previously described prevents a user from accidentally attempting to insert the base <b>26</b> into the housing <b>156</b> in an orientation opposite to that desired (i.e., the upright orientation). That is to say, the base <b>26</b>/housing <b>156</b> interface permits only one orientation of the base <b>26</b>, and thus of the prongs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, relative to the CPAP generator device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> partially illustrates assembly of the base <b>26</b> to the CPAP generator device <b>150</b>, and in particular, the first passage <b>72</b> over the first tube <b>152</b> and the second passage <b>74</b> over the second tube <b>154</b>. As shown, each of the tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> includes a radial slot <b>160</b> that is otherwise fluidly connected to the channel <b>110</b> upon final assembly of the base <b>26</b> within the housing <b>156</b>. With this one arrangement, then, airflow within the tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> is allowed to flow from the tubes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>/base <b>26</b> interface via the channel <b>110</b>, for subsequent pressure monitoring. In one embodiment, a depth and a width of the channel <b>110</b> is correlated with a diameter of the passages <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to minimize formation of back pressure within the device <b>20</b> while still affording the ability to accurately sample pressure being delivered to the patient. To this end, it has surprisingly been found that by forming the channel <b>110</b> to have a depth that is at least 30% of the diameter of either passage <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> (at the rear face <b>70</b>) and a width that is at least 25% of either the passage <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> diameters, significant back pressure will not be generated at expected CPAP levels.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the patient interface device <b>20</b> has been described in connection with certain features of the CPAP generator device <b>150</b>, a wide variety of differing CPAP device configurations can also be employed. That is to say, the patient interface device <b>20</b> in accordance with principles of the present invention is not limited to any one particular CPAP device design.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The infant nasal interface prong device in accordance with principles of the present invention provides a marked improvement over previous prong designs. The thin-walled, bellows segment allows the prong to easily pivot and/or flex relative to the base (and thus the CPAP generator to which the base is assembled). This attribute allows the patient interface device to accommodate any misalignments of the CPAP generator and/or related fixation devices relative to the patient, and further minimizes or eliminates pressure point(s) on the infant's/patient's nasal or facial anatomy that might otherwise be created by CPAP generator misalignment. To this end, the curved shape of the prongs more closely matches an expected anatomy of the patient's naris, and allows the CPAP generator device to be located &#x201c;off&#x201d; of the patient's face. Finally, the inward bias of the prongs readily accommodates deviations in the patient's septal anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
