<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to methods and apparatus for draining a component of a beverage forming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Draining a beverage forming machine, such as a coffee brewer, before storing the machine can help prevent spills, protect the machine from freezing damage and/or reduce the weight of the machine. For example, some commercial coffee brewer machines include a tank that is used to heat and store water before it is used to prepare coffee. Before storing the machine, the tank may be manually drained into a sink or a floor drain with a drain tube, e.g., by removing a plug from a drain line. In some smaller machines, such as single serve coffee brewer machines, draining the hot water tank cannot be done by a consumer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventors have appreciated that an automatic and/or self-contained drain system would facilitate the draining of some beverage forming machines, such as single serve coffee brewers. For example, some single serve coffee brewers have a water tank for heating and/or storing water which is used to brew coffee. In these coffee brewers, a certain amount of the water can be withdrawn from the tank by dispensing it through the normal dispensing tube to a beverage forming station. However, some water always remains in the hot water tank because of the arrangement of the dispensing tube in the tank. Leaving a certain amount of water in the tank may be important, such as to keep a heating element submerged in water so it does not burn out.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the invention, a beverage forming system includes a housing and a tank attached to the housing for holding a beverage precursor liquid, such as water. A beverage forming station is also attached to the housing and is configured to form a beverage in part by using the beverage precursor liquid. For example, the beverage forming station may provide heated water received from the tank to a beverage forming cartridge (a pod or sealed capsule) that includes ground, roasted coffee and a filter element to make a coffee beverage. A supply system is configured to provide beverage precursor liquid from the tank to the beverage forming station, and a drain system is configured to substantially empty the tank of beverage precursor liquid. A controller may be adapted to control the drain system to automatically drain the tank, e.g., by pressing a drain button on the housing to provide a drain command to the controller. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, a user may control a beverage forming system, such as a coffee brewer, to automatically remove liquid from an internal tank that the user could not otherwise empty. Such a feature may be useful, e.g., when storing the beverage forming system in conditions in which water remaining in the system may freeze.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the controller may operate in a beverage forming mode in which the controller is adapted to control the supply system to provide beverage precursor liquid from the tank to the beverage forming station for forming the beverage. The controller may also operate in a drain mode in which the controller is adapted to control the drain system to automatically perform the drain operation. A user may interact with an interface to provide instructions to cause the controller to operate in either the beverage forming mode or the drain mode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the invention, a beverage forming apparatus includes a housing and a beverage forming station attached to the housing and configured to form a beverage in part using a beverage precursor liquid. A tank that is also attached to the housing may be configured to supply the beverage precursor liquid to the beverage forming station. A reservoir may also be supported by the housing, and a drain system may be configured to substantially empty the beverage precursor liquid from the tank into the reservoir. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, liquid drained from the tank may be emptied into a receptacle associated with the beverage forming apparatus itself, rather than into a receptacle separate from the apparatus. This may provide for more convenient draining of the tank, e.g., avoiding the need for a user to move the apparatus near a sink.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the reservoir may be removable from the housing and/or may be used to supply the beverage precursor liquid to the tank. For example, the reservoir may be a water storage tank that may be filled with water by a user for use in making beverages. In another embodiment, the reservoir may be a waste tank that is used only to receive liquid drained from the tank via a pathway that does not include the beverage forming station.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the apparatus may include a controller adapted to control the drain system to automatically move the beverage precursor liquid from the tank to the reservoir. For example, the controller may control the drain system to automatically drain the tank in response to an input from a user.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention, a method for draining the contents of a tank used in a beverage forming machine includes providing a beverage forming machine having a tank, a reservoir arranged to supply beverage precursor liquid to the tank, and a beverage forming station fluidically connected to the tank. A volume of a beverage precursor liquid may be provided to the tank, and the tank may be substantially emptied of the beverage precursor liquid by removing the beverage precursor liquid from the tank and depositing the beverage precursor liquid in the reservoir.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the invention may be practiced with any beverage forming system using any suitable fluid handling and/or control arrangement. Several different embodiments are described herein for purposes of illustration. However, these illustrative embodiments should not be used to narrowly interpret the scope of the invention. For example, embodiments are described below in which a beverage forming apparatus includes an air pressurization system for ejecting liquid from a tank, but aspects of the invention are not limited to this type of arrangement. As an example, aspects of the invention may be used in systems including no air pressurization system, e.g., a system that uses only liquid pumps and/or gravity for movement of liquid. In addition, various aspects of the invention are described herein, and these various aspects may be used in any suitable combination with each other, or alone.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect of the invention, a beverage forming system controller may control a set of valves, pumps, tanks and/or other fluid handling devices in a beverage forming machine to automatically drain a tank of a beverage precursor liquid. The combination of the controller and the fluid handling devices may permit a user to initiate automatic draining simply by pressing one or more buttons. Instead of, or in addition to responding to a user's input, the beverage forming machine may automatically drain in response to the attainment of another pre-selected condition, such as the cooling of the liquid in a tank below a certain temperature or the passage of an amount of time during which the liquid is contained in the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; draining means draining that occurs in response to an electronic control signal (or signals) and does not include solely a manual operation of a flow control component such as a valve, plug, crimp, kink or other stopper component. However, &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; draining may incorporate some manual action, such as the pressing of a button to cause the draining to occur or manual actuation of a valve or other flow control component. All that &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; draining requires herein is that some electronic component be actuated to facilitate draining.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A &#x201c;tank&#x201d;, for purposes herein, means any tank, receptacle, container, reservoir, urn, conduit, tube, hose, pipe or other suitable vessel that can store a volume of liquid. For example, a &#x201c;tank&#x201d; may include an inline or flash heater, a chamber in which a volume of water is heated and stored, or other arrangement. Also, for purposes herein, a tank for holding a beverage precursor liquid is a tank that may hold liquid to be transferred to a beverage forming station for use in forming a beverage. A coffee pot or other receptacle that receives a finished beverage from a beverage dispenser is not considered to be a tank for holding a beverage precursor liquid, for purposes herein. In some embodiments, a tank for holding a beverage precursor liquid is fluidically connected to a beverage forming station. For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;fluidically connected&#x201d; means any of: a connection between two components using one or more open tubes, pipes, channels, etc.; a connection that may be selectively opened and closed by a valve or other component; and/or a connection in which one or more intermediate receptacles or tanks (such as a metering chamber or a reservoir) are used, but fluid is able to move from a first component to a second component either manually or automatically. A fluidic connection does not require that fluid be able to travel in both directions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment incorporating the aspect of automatically draining a tank, a beverage forming machine includes a drain line which is positioned at the bottom of a hot water tank, and further includes a valve that selectively permits or blocks water flow through the drain line. When the user decides to drain the hot water tank, he or she may press a drain button on a control pad to open the valve in the drain line. To speed and/or improve drainage, the beverage forming machine may include an electrically powered component, such as an air pump and/or water pump, which forces the liquid out of the tank during draining. The drained liquid may be directed to any suitable location, such as a waste reservoir, a supply reservoir, a drain port on the housing exterior, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, the controller may track various conditions present in the beverage forming machine and initiate automatic draining if a pre-selected condition is attained. For example, a user may instruct the controller to wait two hours before automatically draining the hot water tank, thereby allowing time for the water to cool before drainage. In another example, the controller may receive data from a temperature sensor, and the user may instruct the controller to drain the hot water tank after the water has cooled to a pre-selected temperature. In another embodiment, the controller may initiate draining of the tank if a certain amount of time passes without a beverage formation operation occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another aspect of the invention, a user need not position the beverage forming machine near a sink or other external receptacle when performing a draining operation. For example, a beverage forming machine may be provided with a self-contained drain feature in which beverage precursor liquid is removed from one tank and deposited in another tank that is part of, or otherwise supported by, the beverage forming machine. In one embodiment, water drained from a hot water tank may be deposited in a water supply reservoir. The reservoir may be removably attached to the machine housing such that the user may remove the reservoir from the housing, e.g., to fill and/or empty the reservoir. In another embodiment, the drain system may deposit water from the hot water tank into a waste reservoir. For disposal of the water, the waste reservoir may be removable from the machine housing. In another embodiment, the drain system may deposit water from the hot water tank into a non-removable tank, which may later be drained by some alternate method, such as a second mechanical or electrical drain valve or pump.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of a beverage forming system <b>1</b> in accordance with aspects of the invention. In this illustrative embodiment, the beverage forming system <b>1</b> is arranged to form brewed beverages, such as coffee, using water provided in a reservoir <b>2</b> that is removably attached to a housing <b>15</b>, e.g., the reservoir <b>2</b> may rest on a platform or other support extending from the housing <b>15</b>. In this illustrative embodiment, the beverage forming system <b>1</b> is arranged to receive disposable beverage forming cartridges (not shown), such as brewing cartridges, that are placed within a beverage forming chamber, such as a brew chamber, of a beverage forming station exposed by raising a handle <b>11</b>. After the cartridge is provided to the system <b>1</b>, a user may cause the system <b>1</b> to form a beverage by interacting with a user input and display <b>13</b> or by simply closing the brew chamber via the handle <b>11</b>. To form the beverage, water from the reservoir <b>2</b> is provided to an internal tank (not shown) in which the water is heated and subsequently provided to the brew chamber. Beverage produced by the system <b>1</b> may be captured in a cup or other vessel placed on a platform <b>12</b>. However, it should be understood that the beverage forming system <b>1</b>, and any beverage forming system or machine described herein, may be arranged to produce any suitable beverage using at least in part any suitable liquid or liquids. For example, the beverage forming machine need not be limited to forming brewed beverages, such as coffee or tea, but may form beverages in other ways, such as providing hot water to be mixed with a powdered drink mix (e.g., hot chocolate), a liquid concentrate, or other suitable material in a cup for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic diagram of various components included in a beverage forming system <b>1</b> according to one aspect of the invention. These components may be incorporated into machine like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Water (or other beverage precursor liquid) from a reservoir <b>2</b> may be provided to a tank <b>53</b> by a supply system, e.g., that includes a water pump <b>52</b> and an inlet line <b>62</b>. Operation of the water pump <b>52</b> and other components of the system <b>1</b> may be controlled by a controller <b>51</b>, e.g., including a programmed processor and/or other data processing device along with suitable software or other operating instructions, one or more memories, input/output interfaces, communication buses or other links, a display, switches, relays, triacs, or other components used to perform desired input/output or other functions. The tank <b>53</b> may be filled with a desired amount of water (or other liquid) by any suitable technique, such as running the water pump <b>52</b> for a predetermined time, sensing a water level in the tank <b>53</b> using a conductive probe sensor or capacitive sensor, detecting a pressure in the tank <b>53</b>, or using any other viable technique. For example, the controller <b>51</b> may detect that the tank <b>53</b> is completely filled when a pressure sensor <b>57</b> detects a rise in pressure indicating that the water has reached the top of the tank <b>53</b>. Water in the tank may be heated, if desired, by way of a heating element <b>61</b> whose operation is controlled by the controller <b>51</b> using input from a temperature sensor <b>60</b>. Water in the tank <b>53</b> may be dispensed via a discharge tube <b>54</b> to a brew chamber <b>55</b> or other beverage forming station. The brew chamber <b>55</b> may include any beverage making ingredient, such as ground coffee, tea, a flavored drink mix, or other substance. Water may be discharged from the tank <b>53</b> through the discharge tube <b>54</b> by a supply system that pressurizes the tank with air provided by an air pump <b>56</b>. The discharge tube <b>54</b> that leads to the brew chamber <b>55</b> may be provided with a discharge tube valve <b>70</b>, such as a mechanical check valve. Completion of the dispensing from the tank <b>53</b> may be detected in any suitable manner, such as by detecting a pressure drop with the pressure sensor <b>57</b>, by detecting a water level change in the tank <b>53</b>, or using any other viable techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When filling the tank <b>53</b> with water from the reservoir <b>2</b>, the tank <b>53</b> may be vented by opening a vent line <b>63</b> including a filter <b>58</b> and a vent valve <b>59</b>. The filter <b>58</b> may prevent undesired items, such as minerals, scale deposits or other, from interfering with the operation of the vent valve <b>59</b>. Typically, the vent valve <b>59</b> is closed when liquid is discharged from the tank <b>53</b> to the brew chamber <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A user may input commands or other information to the controller <b>51</b>, and/or the controller <b>51</b> may provide information to the user via a user input/output display <b>13</b>. The user input/output display <b>13</b> may include an LCD or other suitable display, and/or one or more operation buttons, knobs or other devices that may be used to control the system operation. The various valves, sensors, pumps and other components of the beverage forming system may be may be operatively connected to the controller <b>51</b> such that the components may receive control signals or other information from the controller <b>51</b> and/or may send information to the controller <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the beverage forming system <b>1</b> includes drain system that may be used to drain the beverage precursor liquid (e.g., water) from the tank <b>53</b>. In one embodiment, the drain system may include a drain line <b>64</b> with a flow control element <b>66</b>, e.g., a valve, a solenoid valve, a drain pump, a combination of a valve and a drain pump, or any other suitable flow control element. In some embodiments, the drain system may include some or all of the components in the supply system, such as the water pump <b>52</b> and/or the air pump <b>56</b>. For example, in an embodiment in which the water pump <b>52</b> may be reversibly operated, the supply and drain system may include the same components, i.e., the water pump <b>52</b> may be used to both fill and empty the tank <b>53</b>. That is, the water pump <b>52</b> and inlet line <b>62</b> may alternately function as a drain pump and drain line when pumping water from the tank <b>53</b> into the reservoir <b>2</b>. In another embodiment in which the water pump <b>52</b> cannot pump liquid in two different directions, a drain line may be connected between the tank <b>53</b> and the inlet of the water pump <b>52</b> and between the outlet of the pump <b>52</b> and a location where the drained liquid is deposited. A valving arrangement may be provided in the drain and inlet lines <b>64</b> and <b>62</b> so that the pump <b>52</b> may be selectively used to pump liquid from the reservoir <b>2</b> to the tank <b>53</b>, or pump liquid from the tank <b>53</b> for draining.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in which the flow control element <b>66</b> is a drain line valve, the drain system may include the drain line valve, the drain line <b>64</b> and the air pump <b>56</b>. To place the beverage forming system <b>1</b> in a drain mode, the controller <b>51</b> may close the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> and the vent valve <b>59</b>. (If the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> is a mechanical check valve, the controller <b>51</b> typically will not control its operation.) The controller <b>51</b> then opens the drain line valve <b>66</b> and activates the air pump <b>56</b>, thereby forcing water out of the tank <b>53</b> with air pressure, such that it drains through drain line <b>64</b>. If the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> is a mechanical check valve, the pressure used by the air pump <b>56</b> to move water out of the tank <b>53</b> may be lower than a pressure that causes the valve <b>70</b> to open. Alternately, the flow through the valve <b>70</b> may be sufficiently low so as to not inhibit draining of the tank <b>53</b> through the drain line <b>64</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the tank <b>53</b> may be drained by gravity, without using air pressure from the pump <b>56</b> to drive the liquid from the tank <b>53</b>. (In the embodiment shown, the pump <b>52</b> is configured such that it prevents liquid or gas from flowing from the tank <b>53</b> to the reservoir <b>2</b>. However, the line <b>62</b> could include a one-way valve or other flow control device.)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> embodiment in which the flow control element <b>66</b> includes a drain pump, the drain system may include the drain pump and the drain line <b>64</b>. With the vent valve <b>59</b> open and the air pump <b>56</b> not activated (or not present), the drain pump may be actuated to move water out of the tank <b>53</b> and through drain line <b>64</b>. As discussed above, in another embodiment, the water pump <b>52</b> may function as part of the drain system to drain the tank <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The drain system of this embodiment, and other embodiments described herein, may substantially empty the tank <b>53</b>. A substantially empty tank need not be completely void of all liquid, but rather may retain some residual water (or other beverage precursor liquid) in the form of droplets, water vapor, or small puddles. The tank <b>53</b> may be shaped in some embodiments to gather water at an inlet to the drain line <b>64</b>. For example, a portion of the bottom of the tank <b>53</b> may be shaped as funnel, or other suitable shape, to direct water toward drain line <b>64</b> or other outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Liquid emitted from the drain line <b>64</b> may be directed into any suitable receptacle, such as a countertop container or a kitchen sink. However, in one aspect of the invention, the beverage forming machine may have a self-contained drain feature such that liquid drained from the tank is directed to a receptacle attached to or otherwise associated with the machine housing. This self-contained drain feature may be used with the automated drain feature discussed above in which a controller automatically causes drainage of the tank <b>53</b>, or may be used in a system having a purely manually operated drain feature, e.g., where a user opens a manual drain valve to drain the tank <b>53</b>. Drained water may be deposited in a waste tank, which may be removable from the housing. In another embodiment, the drained liquid may be directed into the reservoir <b>2</b>, whether for reuse or disposal by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic view of a beverage forming system <b>1</b> that includes a waste reservoir <b>80</b> that receives water from the drain line <b>64</b>. The drain line <b>64</b> may be connected to the reservoir <b>80</b>, or may simply have an outlet positioned so that drained liquid empties into the reservoir <b>80</b>. For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;waste reservoir&#x201d; means a receptacle that accepts liquid intended for disposal. Similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, water may be forced from the tank <b>53</b> by air pressure or with a pump. In some embodiments, the waste reservoir <b>80</b> may be positioned at a lower level than the tank <b>53</b>, such that gravity alone is able to substantially empty water from the tank <b>53</b>. The waste reservoir <b>80</b> may include a tray or other container that is supported by the housing, e.g., rests in or on a portion of the housing. The reservoir <b>80</b> may be positioned in any suitable location in or on the housing <b>15</b>, such as on the platform <b>12</b> in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment. The drain line <b>64</b> may be arranged to drain liquid via a pathway that is completely separate from a pathway used to provide liquid to the beverage forming station, or may drain liquid via a pathway that includes at least a portion of a pathway used to form a finished beverage. Thus, in some embodiments, drained liquid may exit from a same opening at the beverage forming station as finished beverage exits, although not as finished beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment, the flow control element <b>66</b> may be a drain line valve that is controlled by the controller <b>51</b>, or it may be a manually operated valve. In embodiments where the drain line valve is a manually operated valve, the controller <b>51</b> may include a display that indicates to the user when the system is ready for the valve to be opened, e.g., when the liquid in the tank <b>53</b> is cool enough to be drained. While in some of the embodiments, all of the valves may be controlled with the controller <b>51</b>, in some embodiments, none or very few of the valves (e.g., vent valve <b>59</b>, discharge tube valve <b>70</b>, the drain line valve) are controlled by the controller <b>51</b>. The tank <b>53</b> may also include one or more sensors that detect when the tank <b>53</b> is substantially empty. Such sensors may operate using any suitable means, such as detecting the presence/absence of liquid via conductivity changes, capacitive sensing, optical sensing, etc. The output from one or more such sensors may be used by the controller <b>51</b> to determine whether to cease draining operations and/or to provide an indication (visual, aural or otherwise) that draining is complete. In some embodiments, the draining operation may continue until stopped by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To reduce the number of tanks in the apparatus, instead of depositing drained water in a waste reservoir, according to one aspect of the invention, liquid drained from a tank may be deposited back into a supply reservoir. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a beverage forming system <b>1</b> that deposits drained water back into a reservoir <b>2</b>. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and described below includes one particular arrangement of valves, pumps, filters, etc., but it should be understood that any suitable fluid handling arrangement may be used to drain liquid from a tank into a supply reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, with drain line valve <b>66</b> closed and vent valve <b>59</b> open, the water pump <b>52</b> may supply water from the reservoir <b>2</b> to the tank <b>53</b>. If desired, the water in the tank <b>53</b> may be heated with the heating element <b>61</b> to a desired temperature. To dispense the water to the brew chamber <b>55</b> through the discharge tube <b>54</b> to form a beverage, the drain valve <b>66</b> and vent valve <b>59</b> are closed, and the air pump <b>56</b> pressurizes the tank <b>53</b> to drive water up and out the discharge tube <b>54</b>. To allow the water to flow to the brew chamber <b>55</b>, the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To place the beverage forming system <b>1</b> in a drain mode, discharge tube valve <b>70</b> is closed, vent valve <b>59</b> is closed, and drain valve <b>66</b> is opened. As air pump <b>56</b> pressurizes the tank <b>53</b>, the water is forced out of the tank <b>53</b> and into the drain line <b>64</b>. The drain line <b>64</b> merges with the vent line <b>63</b> which opens into an upper region of the reservoir <b>2</b>. In this manner, the water remaining in the tank <b>53</b> after beverage formation may be drained to the reservoir <b>2</b>. The reservoir <b>2</b> may be removable in some embodiments such that the drained water can be stored or disposed at a location remote from the remainder of the beverage forming system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The discharge tube valve <b>70</b> and the drain valve <b>66</b> may be positioned separately within the beverage forming system <b>1</b>, or they may be positioned in close proximity or even within a common housing <b>72</b>. In one embodiment, the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> and the drain valve <b>66</b> are positioned within the housing <b>72</b> such that a single manual or automatic action opens the drain valve <b>66</b> and closes the discharge tube valve <b>70</b>. For example, a user may press a button that manually opens the drain valve <b>66</b> and closes the discharge tube valve <b>70</b>. Pressing this button (which may be included as part of the controller <b>51</b>) may also cause the air pump <b>56</b> to operate, thereby causing automatic draining of the tank <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The drain line <b>64</b> need not merge with vent line <b>63</b>, and instead may be connected to the reservoir <b>2</b> at a different location. The inlet line <b>62</b> that connects the reservoir <b>2</b> to the tank <b>53</b> may have a connection to the tank <b>53</b> that is separate from the drain line <b>64</b> connection to the tank <b>53</b>. In another embodiment, the drain line <b>64</b> may merge with the discharge tube <b>54</b> between the discharge tube valve <b>70</b> and the brew chamber <b>55</b> so that drained liquid exits through the brew chamber <b>55</b> to a waste reservoir positioned in a location where finished beverage is normally received.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One example of an operations sequence for one embodiment of the invention is provided below. It is important to note that this operations sequence is provided by way of example only, and any suitable operations sequence may be used in conjunction with various physical embodiments of a beverage forming system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, once the user desires to empty the tank of a beverage forming machine, the user may cause a drain line valve to open, e.g., by pressing a control button on the machine to actuate a drain line valve, a vent valve or other valves required to drain the tank. The machine controller (whether by manual button/electrical switch control and/or via relay(s) under the control of a microprocessor) may suitably control the necessary valves and optionally indicate to the user that the machine is ready for draining, e.g., by illuminating a drain LED. Thereafter, the controller may automatically begin the drain process or wait for additional input from the user to begin draining. The controller may then cause an air pump to operate, thereby pressurizing the tank and forcing water out of the tank through the drain line and into a reservoir. When predominantly air exits the drain line, the tank may be deemed substantially empty, and the controller may stop the drain operation. The controller may determine that the tank is substantially empty by detecting a drop in pressure in the tank, signifying that mainly air is exiting the drain line.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In alternative embodiments, the reservoir <b>2</b> may be positioned at a higher level than the tank <b>53</b> and to allow the beverage forming system <b>1</b> to gravity feed water into the tank <b>53</b>, thereby eliminating pump <b>52</b>. In such embodiments, a valve may be included on inlet line <b>62</b>. While the beverage forming system <b>1</b> has been described as including a reservoir, the water may be supplied to the tank <b>53</b> with a connection to a water supply such as a home's plumbing system. In such embodiments, instead of providing pump <b>52</b>, a valve may be provided on the inlet line <b>62</b> and a pressure reducer may be used.</p>
