<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a garment hanger of the type which includes a locking information clip and more particularly, to a top sizer clip for use with the garment hanger.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are a number of different types of garment hangers that are used to hold a number of different articles of clothing or other types of articles, such as linens or other household fabrics. Typically, garment hangers are either formed of a plastic material or a metal material or a combination thereof. Not only do garment hangers come in a variety of different sizes but they also come in a number of different styles that have different types of constructions to accommodate different articles that are carried by the hangers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, one type of garment hanger construction is designed to secure knitwear, blouses, slips, strapped garments, including dresses and lingerie. Another type of garment hanger construction is designed to also secure blouses, dresses and other light garments, while another type of garment hanger is designed to secure heavier knitwear, blouses, pants and light weight pant suits. Yet another type of garment hanger is designed to secure coats, jackets and outerwear. The foregoing types of garment hangers can be generally classified as being top garment hangers, while another class of garment hangers is pant hangers, which are those hangers that are designed to secure pants, skirts, and other outfits together. Often times, pant hangers incorporate some type of clamp mechanism to securely grasp and hold the articles of clothing. One will appreciate that there are even more types of garment hangers (e.g., bra/panty hanger) that are intended for particular applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One accessory that is often used with a hanger is a size indicator that typically is a small plastic part that attaches to the body of the hanger and has indicia formed thereon that indicates the size or some other identifying mark of the article of clothing that is being held on the hanger. The size indicator can either take the form of a side sizer, where the clip (sizer) attached to the side of a hook member or a top sizer, where the clip attaches more to the top of the hook member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional top sizer clips are most times custom designed for a specific type or style of hanger (i.e., a matching hanger) and therefore, when they are used with other hangers, the clips tend not to be secured to the hanger but instead either are too small so that they can not be received on the base structure or they are too large and therefore, they wobble on the base structure and can easily become disengaged and fall off the hanger. By not having a secure attachment between the clip and the hanger, the size indicators do not perform their full intended function and instead can easily become misplaced and replacement thereof can result in the wrong size indicator being placed on the hanger which in turn can result in the wrong article of clothing being selected by a consumer or if no size indicator is present, the consumer may rummage through the clothing and leave an untidy display in order to find the proper size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are certain instances, when it is desirable to have the ability to remove the top sizer clip from the hanger after it has been securely attached thereto. For example, the top sizer clips are reusable and therefore, they can be removed from one hanger and placed on another hanger. The ability to remove and reuse the top sizer clips reduces cost and reduces waste. However, as mentioned above, the top sizer clip should not be easily removable since this is undesirable and therefore, there is a need for a garment hanger/top sizer combination where the top sizer can be selectively removed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A garment hanger for use with a top sizer clip that has locking tabs formed along an interior thereof includes a body having a hook member including a web portion and a platform extending at least partially around the web portion. The web portion has a first surface, an opposing second surface, and a pair of locking apertures for receiving the locking tabs to securely attach the top sizer clip to hanger. The web portion has at least one beveled cam surface that includes a first edge that defines an entrance into an adjacent locking aperture and an opposite second edge that interfaces with the first surface for allowing the top sizer clip to be moved to an unlocking position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A top sizer clip in combination with a hanger having a body and a hook member includes a top sizer clip body having a pair of side walls and end walls joined to and extending between the side walls. The top sizer body includes a top wall that is joined to upper edges of the side walls and end walls. The top wall partially encloses the body so as to create a hollow body structure that includes an interior compartment defined by the end walls, side walls, and top wall. An inner surface of at least one side wall includes at least one locking tab. The hook member is coupled to a base section of the hanger body and includes a web portion and a platform extending at least partially around the web portion. The web portion has a first surface, an opposing second surface, and at least one locking aperture for receiving the locking tab to securely attach the top sizer clip to hanger in a locked position which prevents removal of the top sizer clip from the hook member. The web portion has at least one beveled cam surface accessible along the first surface. The beveled cam surface includes a first edge that defines an entrance into the locking aperture and an opposite second edge that interfaces with the first surface and permits lateral movement of the top sizer clip on the web portion from the locked position to an unlocking position where the locking tab is displaced from the locking aperture by riding along the cam surface, thereby allowing the top sizer clip to be more easily removed from the hook member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for locking a top sizer clip on a hook member of a garment hanger and then selectively removing the locked top sizer clip from the garment hanger hook member includes the steps of: (1) providing on the hook member a web portion and a platform extending at least partially around the web portion, the web portion having a first surface, an opposing second surface, and a pair of locking apertures; (2) forming a pair of beveled cam surfaces in the web portion, the cam surfaces being accessible along the first surface, each beveled cam surface including a first edge that defines an entrance into the locking aperture and an opposite second edge that interfaces with the first surface; (3) inserting the top sizer clip on the web portion such that the web portion is received into a hollow interior thereof, the top sizer clip having a pair of locking tabs formed along an inner surface of one side wall within the hollow interior, the locking tabs initially contacting the first surface of the web portion; (4) aligning the locking tabs with the locking apertures and directing the top sizer clip down along the first surface until the locking tabs are snap-lockingly received within respective locking apertures, thereby securely attaching the top sizer clip to the hook member in a locked position which prevents removal of the top sizer clip from the hook member; and (5) selectively moving the top sizer clip to an unlocking position when it is desired to remove the top sizer clip by laterally moving the top sizer clip along the platform causing the locking tabs to encounter and ride up along corresponding cam surfaces resulting in outward separation of side walls of the top sizer clip, thereby permitting the top sizer clip to then be lifted upwardly and removed from the web portion as the locking tabs rides along the first surface outside of the locking apertures and the cam surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, a user can selectively remove the top sizer clip from the web portion by following a two step process, namely, a first step where the top sizer clip is moved laterally relative to the web portion (hook member) until an unlocking position is achieved and then a second step where the top sizer clip is moved vertically relative to the web portion to disengage the top sizer clip from the hook member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side perspective view of a portion of a garment hanger <b>100</b> that includes a body portion (not shown) having two opposing ends and a hook member <b>120</b> that is attached to the body portion. A top sizer clip (indicator) <b>200</b> according to the present invention is shown in an exploded manner relative to the hook member <b>120</b>. As described below, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is constructed to intimately engage and be securely, yet releasably, attached to a portion of the hook member <b>120</b>. It will be appreciated that the garment hanger <b>100</b> can have any number of conventional constructions, including having a body portion that is of a flat bar type suitable for holding a top or the like. However, the garment hanger <b>100</b> can be of the type that includes a clamp or grip assembly formed near or at each of the first and second ends for holding a pant or the like. The grip assemblies can be integrally formed with the body portion at the first and second ends. It will be appreciated that the garment hanger <b>100</b> and/or the top sizer clip indicator <b>200</b> can be formed of either an opaque material or transparent material, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The body portion of the garment hanger, including any grip assemblies and including the hook member <b>120</b>, is preferably made as a single piece, molded in plastic using a plastic injection molding machine, as understood by those skilled in the art. Any appropriate plastic can be used, such as styrene, which provides a clear, virtually transparent hanger and alternatively, the hanger <b>100</b> can be molded using polypropylene, such as H.I. styrene polypropylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, ABS or other suitable thermoplastics and/or mixtures thereof. As understood by those skilled in the art, the plastic mixture used to mold the hangers can include additional resins for added strength and reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One exemplary type of garment hanger <b>100</b> is shown in commonly assigned U.S. design Pat. No. D453,423. This type of garment hanger <b>100</b> is commonly referred to as a bra and panty hanger.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illustrated garment hanger <b>100</b> is of a fixed hook type construction in that the hook member <b>120</b> for fixed attachment to the body portion at a location that is generally at a midpoint along the body portion. Unlike the hook member in the '423 patent, the hook member <b>120</b> of the garment hanger <b>100</b> is configured to receive and lockingly engage the top sizer clip <b>200</b>. More specifically, the uppermost arcuate edge of a conventional rounded hook member <b>120</b> has been removed and modified to allow for reception and locking with the top sizer clip <b>200</b>. Instead, the hook member <b>120</b> has a web <b>130</b> for removably securing the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to the garment hanger <b>100</b>. The web <b>130</b> defines the topmost structure of the hook member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the web <b>130</b> has different dimensions than the surrounding portions of the hook member <b>120</b>. In particular, the hook member <b>120</b> has a platform <b>140</b> from which the web <b>130</b> extends upwardly. The platform <b>140</b> is planar in nature and has a length L defined by front and back edges <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, respectively, and has a width or thickness W defined by a pair of opposing ends <b>146</b>. The length L is greater than the width W. In addition, the width W is typically the same width as the remaining portions of the hook member <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the platform <b>140</b> is generally rectangular in shape; however, other shapes are equally possible so long as the top sizer clip <b>200</b> seats properly relative to the platform <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The web <b>130</b> is disposed along the platform <b>140</b> such that it extends upwardly therefrom. In contrast to conventional design and for reasons described in detail below, the web <b>130</b> is not centered relative to the platform <b>140</b> but rather is formed in an off-centered position (in the left to right (lateral) direction) along the platform <b>140</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a distance A is formed between a first end <b>132</b> of the web <b>130</b> and the end <b>146</b> of the platform <b>140</b> and a distance B is formed between an opposite second end <b>134</b> of the web <b>130</b> and the end <b>146</b> of the platform <b>140</b>. The distance A is greater than the distance B, thus indicating the off-centered nature of the web <b>130</b>. The web <b>130</b> has a first surface or face <b>131</b> that faces the front edge <b>142</b> of the platform <b>140</b> and an opposite second surface or face <b>133</b> that faces the rear edge <b>144</b> of the platform <b>140</b>. The web <b>130</b> is preferably perpendicularly oriented relative to the top surface of the platform <b>140</b>. A shoulder (e.g., right angled shoulder) is formed between the web <b>130</b> and the platform <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The web <b>130</b> itself can have any number of different shapes so long as the shape of the web <b>130</b> is complementary to the construction of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to allow reception on and locking between the top sizer clip <b>200</b> and the web <b>130</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the web <b>130</b> has a crescent or semi-circular shape that includes the two ends <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and includes a top edge <b>136</b> that defines the topmost portion of the garment hanger <b>100</b>. A height of the web <b>130</b> is defined as the distance between the top edge <b>136</b> at its apex and a bottom edge <b>135</b> of the web <b>130</b> at the interface between the web <b>130</b> and platform <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Unlike the off-centered nature of the web <b>130</b> in the lateral direction along the platform <b>140</b>, the web <b>130</b> is preferably centered in the front-to-back direction on the platform <b>140</b>. In other words, the distance between the first surface or face <b>131</b> of the web and the front edge <b>142</b> of the platform <b>140</b> and the distance between the second surface or face <b>133</b> and the rear edge <b>144</b> of the platform <b>140</b> is equal or about equal to one another. This arrangement is possible since the web <b>130</b> has a width or thickness that is less than the thickness of the platform <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A peripheral ledge <b>150</b> is thus formed around the web <b>130</b> for receiving the top sizer clip <b>200</b> as described below. The peripheral ledge <b>150</b> is thus an exposed planar portion of the platform <b>140</b> formed around the web <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the present invention, besides being off-centered relative to the platform <b>140</b>, the web <b>130</b> includes a pair of locking members <b>160</b> that permit the top sizer clip to be removably interlocked with the web <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the locking members <b>160</b> are in the form of a pair of locking apertures or openings (through holes) <b>160</b> that are formed in the web <b>130</b> and extend therethrough from the first surface <b>131</b> to the second surface <b>133</b>. In one embodiment, the locking apertures <b>160</b> are evenly and uniformly formed in the web <b>130</b>. In other words, the distance from each aperture <b>160</b> to the respect end <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> is equal or about equal and the distance from each aperture <b>160</b> to the bottom edge <b>135</b> is equal or about equal. However, the locking apertures <b>160</b> can be formed in a non-uniform manner within the web <b>130</b>. The illustrated locking apertures <b>160</b> have a square or rectangular shape; however, these shapes are merely exemplary and other shapes, such as oval or circular can also be used for the locking apertures <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each locking aperture <b>160</b> includes a feature that, as described below in more detail, permits the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to be more easily removed when it is selectively moved along the web <b>130</b> to an unlocking position. More specifically, each locking aperture <b>160</b> includes a cam surface <b>170</b> that communicates and interfaces with the aperture <b>160</b>. The cam surface <b>170</b> is in the form of a ramp or inclined surface that cooperates at one end with the locking aperture <b>160</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cam surface <b>170</b> has a first end <b>172</b> that intersects an inner wall <b>161</b> that defines the locking aperture <b>160</b> and has an opposite second end <b>174</b> that intersects the first surface or face <b>131</b> of the web <b>130</b>. The cam surface <b>170</b> is a beveled surface in that it is angled relative to both the inner wall <b>161</b> and the first surface <b>131</b>. The degree of the angle of the cam surface <b>170</b> can vary depending upon the particular application. However, the cam surface <b>170</b> can form an angle between about 20&#xb0; and about 45&#xb0; relative to the first surface <b>131</b> of the web <b>130</b> (alternatively, the angle can be between about 15&#xb0; and about 30&#xb0;). However, these numbers are merely for example only as it will be appreciated that the angle of the cam surface <b>170</b> can be greater than 45&#xb0; in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The apertures <b>160</b> are axially aligned such that a central axis extending through the apertures <b>160</b> is at least substantially parallel to the top surface of the platform <b>140</b>. The first end <b>172</b> of the cam surface <b>170</b> is formed so that is preferably formed at one end or side of the aperture <b>160</b>. It is important to note that the cam surfaces <b>170</b> are not formed such that they directly face one another. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is one cam aperture <b>160</b> between the two cam surfaces <b>170</b>. In other words, the far right cam surface <b>170</b> directly faces the end <b>134</b>, while the left cam surface <b>170</b> is positioned between the two apertures <b>160</b>. The alignment and positioning of the cam surfaces <b>170</b> is such that the top sizer clip <b>200</b> can be moved laterally along the web <b>130</b> and the platform <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be appreciated that the illustrated embodiment only includes the cam surfaces <b>170</b> along the first surface <b>131</b> of the web <b>130</b>; however, in another embodiment, the cam surfaces <b>170</b> can be formed also in the second surface <b>133</b> so as to provide cam surfaces <b>170</b> on both faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> of the web <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> illustrate the top sizer clip <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The top sizer clip <b>200</b> is formed of a clip body <b>210</b> that is essentially hollow and is defined by a first side wall <b>212</b>, an opposing second side wall <b>214</b>, a first end wall <b>216</b>, an opposing second end wall <b>218</b>, and a top wall <b>220</b>. The bottom of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is open so as to permit the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to be inserted over the hook member <b>120</b> and then securely attached to the hanger <b>100</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While the top sizer clip <b>200</b> can be formed of any number of different materials, the clip <b>200</b> is typically made from a plastic material using conventional techniques, such as molding techniques, e.g., injection molding. The clip <b>200</b> can be either opaque in nature or semi-transparent or transparent and can be formed to have any number of different colors.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the first and second side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> can have a substantially parallelogram shape in that top and bottom edges <b>213</b>, <b>215</b>, respectively, thereof are parallel and the two end walls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> join the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> at an angle such that the ends are beveled walls with respect to a ground surface (bottom edge <b>215</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, only a portion of each end walls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> is beveled, with the other portion being a vertical portion; however, it will be understood that the entire end wall <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be beveled.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The end walls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> extend between the two side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and are joined at their top edges <b>217</b> to the top wall <b>220</b>. The end walls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can have any number of different shapes. In the illustrated embodiment, the end walls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> have a rounded shape in that the outer edges thereof are rounded. The top edge <b>213</b> that joins the top wall <b>220</b> can likewise be rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the body <b>210</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> has an inner surface <b>230</b> and an opposing outer surface <b>241</b>. The inner surface <b>230</b> of the clip <b>200</b> is partially defined by an inner face formed as part of each side wall <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Each inner face of each side wall <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> includes a pair of attachment features <b>240</b> that facilitate the secure attachment of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to the hanger <b>100</b>, and more particularly, to the web <b>130</b> of the hook member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the attachment feature is in the form of a pair of locking tabs or nubs <b>240</b> that are formed along the inner surface <b>240</b> and protrude or extend above the surrounding sections of the inner surface <b>240</b>. The locking tabs <b>240</b> lie within a plane that is parallel to the bottom edges <b>215</b> of the clip <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the locking tabs <b>240</b> are positioned proximate to the bottom edges <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The locking tab <b>240</b> can have any number of different shapes; however, the size and shape of the locking tabs <b>240</b> are selected in view of the dimensions of the locking apertures <b>160</b> and the cam surfaces <b>170</b> to allow for reception of the locking tabs <b>240</b> into the apertures <b>160</b> and allow for the locking tabs <b>240</b> to ride along the cam surfaces <b>170</b>. For example, the locking tabs <b>240</b> can be rounded bumps (as illustrated) or they can be square or rectangular shaped tabs or they can have other shapes. The shape and dimensions (e.g., height and length) of the inner cavity of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> are such that the web <b>130</b> can be received therein when the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is inserted onto the web <b>130</b> and locked in place.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The locking tabs <b>240</b> are formed so that a distance from the locking tabs <b>240</b> to the bottom edges <b>215</b> is about equal to the distance from the aperture <b>160</b> to the top surface of the platform <b>140</b>. This allows the locking tabs <b>240</b> to engage the apertures <b>160</b> when the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is received on the web <b>130</b> and placed in the locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and as described below. The locking tabs <b>240</b> are located opposite one another on the inner surfaces <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The process of securely attaching the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to the hanger <b>100</b> and more particularly, the web <b>130</b> of the hook member <b>120</b>, is now described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is first aligned relative to the hanger <b>100</b> such that the bottom edge of the clip <b>200</b> and the interior thereof face and are located above the web <b>130</b> of the hook member <b>120</b>. The locking tabs <b>240</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> are first vertically aligned with the apertures <b>160</b> and as the web <b>130</b> is inserted into the interior of the top sizer clip <b>200</b>, the locking tabs <b>240</b> engage the first and second faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> of the web <b>130</b> and since the thickness of the web <b>130</b> is greater than the space <b>243</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between the locking tabs <b>240</b> in a relaxed state of the clip <b>200</b>, the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> flex outwardly as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The top sizer clip <b>200</b> is then continually advanced toward the platform <b>140</b> resulting in the locking tabs <b>240</b> being driven toward the locking apertures <b>160</b> as shown by the arrow F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show the top sizer clip <b>200</b> in a locked position relative to the garment hanger <b>100</b>. The top sizer clip <b>200</b> is driven toward the platform <b>140</b> until the locking tabs <b>240</b> engage and are received within the locking apertures <b>160</b> resulting in the top sizer clip <b>200</b> being securely attached to the garment hanger <b>100</b>. In other words, the locking tabs <b>240</b> slide along the faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> until the locking tabs <b>240</b> are received into the locking apertures <b>160</b>. Upon being received within the locking apertures <b>160</b>, the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> flex inwardly toward one another since the interference created between the locking tabs <b>240</b> and faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> is at least partially eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this locked position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is completely contained within the interior of the web <b>130</b>. In other words, the ends <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> of the web <b>130</b> are contained within the ends <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> and the top edge <b>137</b> of the web <b>130</b> is positioned below the top wall <b>220</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b>. In addition, in the locked position, the end <b>134</b> of the web <b>130</b> is positioned close to the end <b>218</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b>; however, the end <b>216</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is spaced slightly away from the end <b>132</b> due to the off-centered nature of the web <b>130</b> on the platform <b>140</b> (distance A being greater than distance B). However, in the locked position, there is still a smooth transition from the surfaces of the hook member <b>120</b> and the ends <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b>. In other words, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> covers the peripheral ledge <b>150</b> of the platform when it is in the locked position and a clean look is provided for the top sizer clip <b>200</b> on the hook member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the locking tabs <b>240</b> of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> engage the locking apertures <b>160</b>, a snap-fit results between the top sizer clip <b>200</b> and the garment hanger <b>100</b>. This results in the top sizer clip <b>200</b> being securely attached to the web <b>130</b> of the garment hanger in a manner in which removal of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is difficult. In the locked position, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is not intended to be removed since it is very difficult to get a fingernail underneath one side wall <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> in order to lift the wall a sufficient distance in order to cause the locking tab <b>240</b> to clear the opening <b>160</b> and engage the respective face <b>131</b>, <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the locked position, the bottom edges <b>213</b>, <b>215</b> are located proximate or in contact with the top surface of the platform <b>140</b> (the peripheral ledge <b>150</b> thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with the present invention, the web <b>130</b> has a clip unlocking or release feature (cam surfaces <b>170</b>) that permits a locked top sizer clip <b>200</b> to be more easily removed from the web <b>130</b> when desired. The selective removal of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is a two part process that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the user laterally moves the top sizer clip <b>200</b> along the platform <b>140</b> to cause one pair of locking tabs <b>240</b> to encounter and begin riding up the inclined cam surfaces <b>170</b>. As the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is continually advanced laterally along the platform <b>140</b>, the pair of locking tabs <b>140</b> ride up the cam surfaces <b>170</b> toward the second ends <b>174</b> thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. This results in the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of the clip <b>200</b> flexing outwardly. It will be appreciated that the off-centered nature (distance A&#x3e;distance B) of the web <b>130</b> permits the top sizer clip <b>200</b> to have a range of movement on the platform <b>140</b>. If the web portion <b>130</b> was centered on the platform <b>140</b>, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> would not have the necessary lateral movement to allow for the displacement of the locking tabs <b>240</b> from the locking apertures <b>160</b> and the disengagement of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> from the hook member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is laterally moved along the platform <b>140</b> to cause the end <b>216</b> thereof to engage the end <b>132</b> of the web <b>130</b>, the locking tabs <b>240</b> are located near or at the second ends <b>174</b> or actually and preferably are located along the first face <b>131</b> adjacent the cam surfaces <b>170</b>. In other words, the distance A and the length of the ramp (distance from end <b>172</b> to end <b>174</b>) are selected so that when the clip <b>200</b> is moved laterally along the platform <b>140</b> to a position where the ends <b>216</b>, <b>132</b> are in contact, the locking tabs <b>240</b> have cleared the locking apertures <b>160</b>. In this position, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> can be lifted upward as discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. It will be appreciated that even in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the top sizer clip <b>200</b> will not simply fall off the hanger <b>100</b> if inverted; however, the ease and degree of force necessary to remove the clip <b>200</b> are significantly improved compared to the ease and force needed to remove the clip <b>200</b> when it is in the fully locked position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> thus shows an unlocked position where removal of the clip <b>200</b> is easier.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show the top sizer clip <b>200</b> being disengaged from the web <b>130</b> and in a position for easier removal of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> from the web <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show the locking tabs <b>240</b> being seated against the faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> outside of the apertures <b>160</b> and cam surfaces <b>170</b> as a result of the upward lifting of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> relative to the web <b>130</b>. The top sizer clip <b>200</b> is lifted up and the locking tabs <b>240</b> ride along the faces <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> until the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is completely lifted off of and removed from the web <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Because of the general resilient nature of the top sizer clip <b>200</b>, especially, the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, if the clip <b>200</b> is removed from the web <b>130</b> as described above, the side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may resume, as least in part, their shape. This promotes reuse of the clip <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, while a pair of cam surfaces <b>170</b> is shown, it will be appreciated that only a single cam surface <b>170</b> can be formed in the web <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, one locking tab <b>240</b> engages the single cam surface <b>170</b> causing local separation of the clip walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, thereby permitting disengagement of the top sizer clip <b>200</b> from the web portion <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Advantageously, a user can selectively remove the top sizer clip <b>200</b> from the web portion <b>130</b> by following a two step process, namely, a first step where the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is moved laterally relative to the web portion <b>130</b> (hook member <b>120</b>) until an unlocking position is achieved and then a second step where the top sizer clip <b>200</b> is moved vertically relative to the web portion <b>130</b> to disengage the top sizer clip <b>200</b> from the hook member <b>120</b>.</p>
