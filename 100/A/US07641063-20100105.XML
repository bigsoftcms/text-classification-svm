<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Some embodiments of the present invention provide structure that can be installed within a warehouse-type rack to convert the rack for use as a merchandise and display rack. In this manner, warehouse-type racks can be provided with a greater degree of adjustability to accommodate a larger number of shelving and product storage and display configurations. The structure installed within a warehouse-type rack can include secondary uprights connected to secondary front-rear stretchers. Preferably, the connections between the secondary uprights and the secondary front-rear stretchers are adjustable so that the secondary uprights can be secured in different positions within the warehouse-type rack. In some embodiments, the secondary uprights can be secured in different front-rear positions in the rack and/or can be secured in different vertical positions with respect to the secondary front-rear stretchers.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority is hereby claimed to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/824,007 filed on Apr. 14, 2004, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/155,851 filed on May 24, 2002, United States Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/378,773 filed on May 8, 2002, and United States Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/293,954 filed on May 25, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to racks, and more particularly to adjustable racks and rack systems for storing and displaying merchandise and other items, methods of assembling such racks and rack systems, and components of such racks and rack systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional warehouse-type racks are increasingly used in applications for which they were not initially designed. Previously, such racks were commonly employed in storage and warehouse facilities to store and organize products in bulk form. However, for purposes of cost-savings and with the increased popularity of warehouse-type stores, many users now employ warehouse-type racks in retail establishments. Although such racks are strong, durable, and are capable of storing large quantities of product, a number of drawbacks exist in using warehouse-type racks to display and store merchandise (as well as for other purposes).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By way of example only, conventional warehouse-type racks are significantly limited in their adjustability&#x2014;and hence the different shelving configurations possible&#x2014;due to the relatively large sizes of the rack components. In many warehouse-type racks, stretchers extend laterally and in front-rear directions in order to connect vertically-extending uprights. Such uprights typically have a limited number locations to which the stretchers can be connected. This limitation is at least partially the product of the heavy-duty design of such racks, which are intended to carry much larger loads than relatively light-duty merchandise racks and displays found in most retail establishments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As another example, warehouse-type racks are not well-suited to display and store merchandise and other product in more than a limited number of manners. Typically, warehouse-type racks have relatively large shelves each providing an open space upon which product can be stored. Although well-suited for storing large quantities of product in a limited amount of space, such racks are not well-suited for displaying merchandise, for efficiently storing and displaying smaller quantities of product (e.g., merchandise in unbundled form, individually-wrapped products, and the like), for permitting easy adjustment of shelving and displays, and for other purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the present invention provide structure that can be installed within a warehouse-type rack to convert such a rack for use as a merchandise and/or display rack. In this manner, warehouse-type racks can be provided with a significantly greater degree of adjustability to accommodate a greater number of shelving and/or product storage and display configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the structure installed within a warehouse-type rack includes one or more of the following components: secondary front-rear stretchers, secondary uprights connecting upper and lower secondary front-rear stretchers on the rack, stabilizer bars connecting secondary front-rear stretchers together, support spacers connecting secondary uprights and/or secondary front-rear stretchers, and display walls or panels directly or indirectly connected to the secondary uprights and/or secondary front-rear stretchers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the secondary uprights are adjustably connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers so that the secondary uprights can be secured in different positions within the warehouse-type rack. In some embodiments, the secondary uprights can be secured in different front-rear positions in the rack. In other embodiments, the secondary uprights can be secured in different vertical positions with respect to the secondary front-rear stretchers. In still other embodiments the secondary uprights can be secured in different front-rear positions and can be secured in different vertical positions with respect to the secondary front-rear stretchers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The structure of the present invention preferably enables a user to convert a warehouse-type rack to a storage and display rack that is more suited for a retail environment, is better adapted for displaying different merchandise and other product, and/or has increased adjustability to meet the demands of different users and applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, standard warehouse-type rack systems usually employ a number of uprights <b>10</b> connected together by lateral stretchers <b>12</b> and front-rear stretchers <b>14</b>, both horizontal and diagonal. The uprights <b>10</b> and stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be tubular or solid and can have any cross sectional shape. By way of example only, the uprights <b>10</b> and/or stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can have a variety of cross sections as may be required or desirable, such as hollow rectangular, C-shaped, round, or I- or L-shaped. These elements also can be solid bars or rods or have other polygonal cross sections with flanges, extensions, and other features as needed, and the like. One popular rack style is illustrated in the figures, in which a number of C-shaped uprights <b>10</b> are connected together by lateral stretchers <b>12</b> having hollow stepped rectangular cross sections and by front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> having hollow rectangular cross sections. The uprights <b>10</b> and the stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be made of any resilient material such as metal, composites, high-strength plastic, and the like. Most preferably, these elements are made of a relatively high-strength material such as steel, iron, or aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Front-rear stretchers can be connected in any conventional manner to the lateral stretchers, and can run perpendicularly or at any other angle with respect to the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>. Still other types of stretchers can be employed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Typically, the uprights <b>10</b> are adjustably connected to either or both types of stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Adjustable connections between uprights <b>10</b> and stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be accomplished in a number of different conventional manners. For example, the uprights <b>10</b> can have a series of apertures along all or part of their lengths into which pins, posts, keys, fingers, or other protrusions on the ends of the stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> extend for connection to the uprights <b>10</b>. Alternatively or in addition, conventional fasteners such as pins and mating apertures, threaded fasteners passed through either or both the uprights <b>10</b> and stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, clamps, and interlocking flanges on the uprights <b>10</b> and stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be employed. Still other manners of releasably and adjustably connecting the uprights <b>10</b> to either or both types of stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are conventional in nature and are not therefore described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some types of racks, either or both types of stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are permanently connected to the uprights <b>10</b>, such as by welding, brazing, riveting, or by forming the stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> integrally with the uprights <b>10</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9C</figref>, the uprights <b>10</b> are releasably connected to the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> by pins on the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> releasably inserted within mating apertures in the uprights <b>10</b>. In this same embodiment, the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> are permanently secured to the uprights <b>10</b> by welding. In this manner, the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> can be disconnected from upright and front-rear stretcher assemblies (which can then be easily stacked for storage or shipping, if desired).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The heights of shelves in the racks described above are dictated by the connection location of the stretchers employed to support the shelves. In this regard, the heights of shelves are determined by the heights of the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> if the shelves rest upon and are supported by the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b>, and are determined by the heights of the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> if the shelves rest upon and are supported by the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment for example, the warehouse rack shelves are only supported by the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the location of the connections between the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> and the uprights <b>10</b> (e.g., the upright apertures to which the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> are connected) determines the heights of the shelves in the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As discussed above, the relatively large size of the stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in a conventional warehouse-type rack significantly limits the adjustability and the available shelving configurations of the rack. This is true regardless of the manner in which either or both types of stretchers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are adjustably connected to the uprights <b>10</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, the conventional warehouse-type rack is provided with structure that increases the adjustability to accommodate a greater number of shelving configurations. In the illustrated preferred embodiment for example, the structure employed for this purpose includes secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> supporting secondary uprights <b>18</b>. Preferably, the present invention employs one or more stabilizer bars <b>20</b> for retaining the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in desired positions on the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack and for strengthening the structure of the present invention, one or more support spacers <b>22</b> for increasing lateral strength and rigidity of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or for connection of other display structure to be supported by the secondary uprights <b>18</b>, one or more display panels or walls <b>24</b> (to which merchandise display and support elements can also be connected in some embodiments), and one or more shelves <b>26</b> upon which merchandise can be displayed and supported. Various embodiments of the present invention can employ any number (including none) of these additional elements as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to providing a secondary product support and display structure for conventional warehouse-type rack systems, the present invention preferably enables a user to position merchandise in an increased range of vertical and horizontal positions within a warehouse-type rack. Most preferably, the conversion rack assembly of the present invention enables a user to locate merchandise display and support elements such as shelves, buckets, baskets, hangers, and the like at any number of desired vertical, lateral, and front-rear positions within a warehouse-type rack. In some preferred applications, a user is capable of locating such elements in any position within an area defined by two levels of stretchers <b>12</b>, and by the front, rear, and sides of the warehouse-type rack. In other preferred embodiments, the user is capable of locating such elements at least within a range of positions in this area.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The conversion rack assembly of the present invention can preferably be installed, removed, and adjusted within a warehouse-type rack without disturbing the warehouse-type rack itself. This provides significant advantages over conventional warehouse-type racks and other rack systems by making installation, removal, and adjustment simple and fast. Also, the adjustability of the conversion rack assembly of the present invention is much greater than that of the larger warehouse-type racks within which it is installed, providing a user with the same or similar display and storage options as offered in lighter-duty retail-type display and storage rack systems.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although the structure of the present invention can be permanently incorporated into a warehouse-type rack (i.e., integral with such a rack), a removable conversion rack assembly is preferred because it enables a user to purchase and use standard warehouse-type racks and to install conversion rack assemblies only on an as-needed basis. Another advantage of the present invention is the fact that the conversion rack assembly does not require a separate support structure. Instead, the conversion rack assembly of the present invention preferably relies upon the support and ground-contacting structure of the warehouse-type rack in which it is installed. This reduces the cost, complexity, and assembly time of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> of the present invention preferably rest upon and are supported by the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack. The secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can have any shape and can be made of any preferably resilient material desired, including, without limitation, those described above with reference to the elements of the warehouse-type rack. In the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9C</figref>, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are tubular members having rectangular cross-sections. Although the ends of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can rest upon the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> more preferably have flange supports <b>28</b> on their ends. These flange supports <b>28</b> provide an increased footprint for the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and therefore increase the stability of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> upon the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack. The flange supports <b>28</b> can be flat or bent plates which are welded, bolted, or connected in any other conventional manner to the ends of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. The flange supports <b>28</b> can take other shapes providing the preferred increased footprint. In some highly preferred embodiments, the ends of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> rest in a recessed lip of the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack. Although not required, this enables the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to be recessed within the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in the warehouse-type rack can be retained in any number of desired positions along the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> in any conventional manner, such as by being bolted, clamped, or clipped to the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>, by pin and aperture connections of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> (e.g., pins, posts, fingers, or other protrusions on the ends of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> removably received within apertures in the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> or vice-versa), by being received within recesses in the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some alternative embodiments, the elements or structure used to retain the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in desired positions along the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> require no conventional fasteners and no tools to install. For example, the upper front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in the rack assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref> (described in greater detail below) rest upon plates <b>50</b> which are preferably shaped to rest upon the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. These plates <b>50</b> can extend any length along the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>, but preferably have substantially the same length as the width of their associated front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. The plates <b>50</b> can be made of any material desired, including any of the materials described herein used for other elements of the rack assembly. Also, the plates <b>50</b> (if employed) can be secured to the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and/or to the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> in any manner desired, such as by a relatively close or tight fit as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, and/or in any other manner described herein with reference to the connection between the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref>, plates <b>50</b> are connected to the upper front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> by threaded fasteners passing through aligned apertures in the plates <b>50</b> and front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some preferred embodiments, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are retained in desired positions by one or more stabilizer bars <b>20</b> connected to and between the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>A, and <b>6</b>B). The stabilizer bars <b>20</b> can take any shape and be of any material such as those described above with reference to the elements of the warehouse-type rack. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the stabilizer bar <b>20</b> is an elongated strip having notched and apertured ends.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The ends of the stabilizer bar <b>20</b> are preferably received within apertures <b>30</b> in the sides of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Most preferably, the apertures <b>30</b> in the sides of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are shaped to interlock with the notched ends of the stabilizer bars <b>20</b>. A threaded fastener, finger, pin, or other element can be inserted into the apertures <b>32</b> in the ends of the stabilizer bars <b>20</b> after their insertion into the apertures <b>30</b> of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in order to retain the connection between the stabilizer bars <b>20</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The stabilizer bars <b>20</b> can be releasably connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in a number of other conventional manners, such as by being bolted, clamped, snap-fit, or clipped thereto, by being attached to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> with pin and aperture connections, and the like. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that still other manners of releasably connecting the stabilizer bars <b>20</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are possible, each one of which falls within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9C</figref>, two stabilizer bars <b>20</b> are connected between adjacent secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as described above: a stabilizer bar <b>20</b> at each end of each secondary front-rear stretcher <b>16</b>. However, it should be noted that any number of stabilizer bars <b>20</b> located anywhere along the lengths of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can be employed, and can connect the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> at any angle desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, the conversion rack assembly of the present invention employs secondary uprights <b>18</b> supported by the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are preferably elongated tubular elements. The secondary uprights <b>18</b> can have any cross-sectional shape and can be made of any resilient material, such as those described above with reference to the elements of the warehouse-type rack assembly. Preferably however, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> have a rectangular cross-section and extend between secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> located in a vertically spaced arrangement with respect to one another&#x2014;that is, between front-rear stretchers above and below one another.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ends of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are preferably connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> by a number of plates <b>33</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b>). The plates <b>33</b> can be integral with or permanently connected to either or both the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, such as by welding, brazing, riveting, and the like. However, the plates <b>33</b> are more preferably releasably connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, such as by one or more threaded fasteners, one or more conventional clamps, or pins, posts, or fingers received in apertures in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, and the like. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that still other manners of permanently and releasably connecting the plates <b>33</b> to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> exist, each of which falls within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By their connection to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as described herein, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can preferably bear the load of panels or walls <b>24</b> directly or indirectly connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> (described in more detail below), merchandise display and storage elements connected to the panels or walls <b>24</b> or otherwise directly or indirectly connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b>, and merchandise supported by such elements. The connections of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to upper and lower secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are both preferably capable of bearing such loads. As a result, these loads are preferably not only supported from below by the lower front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, but also from above by the upper secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. The preferred load-bearing connections between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the upper and lower secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> therefore result in an increased load-bearing capacity of the conversion rack apparatus of the present invention. In other embodiments where only one of the connections between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> is capable of bearing significant load, the conversion rack apparatus may have a reduced load-bearing capacity. In some cases where a relatively large load-bearing capacity of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> is not needed, one of the ends of each secondary upright <b>18</b> need not necessarily be connected to a secondary front-rear stretcher <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Any number of plates <b>33</b> can be used to connect the end of a secondary upright <b>18</b> to a secondary front-rear stretcher <b>16</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, two plates <b>33</b> flanking the ends of each secondary upright <b>18</b> and flanking the secondary front-rear stretcher <b>16</b> are preferably employed. In other embodiments, one, three, or even more plates <b>33</b> can be used as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The plates <b>33</b> function to create a reinforced joint between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. A releasable connection between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (enabled, for example, by a releasable connection of the plates <b>33</b> to either or both of these elements) provides the conversion rack assembly of the present invention with significantly increased versatility for the arrangement of other components such as shelving and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With regard first to the releasable connection and adjustability of the plates <b>33</b> on the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, this feature enables the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to be connected at multiple points along the length of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and thereby permits a user to select the desired depth of the merchandise storage and display area of the conversion rack assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The plates <b>33</b> can be adjustably secured in multiple locations on the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in a number of different manners. Most preferably, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> have multiple apertures <b>34</b> along their lengths (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>) to which the plates <b>33</b> can be connected by passing threaded fasteners, pins, rods, or other elements through the apertures <b>34</b> and through aligned apertures <b>36</b> in the plates <b>33</b>. Other manners of connecting the plates <b>33</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> at different points along the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> include a releasable clamp on the plates <b>33</b> that can be tightened to releasably secure the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in place on the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, multiple detents along the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> into which a ratchet, spring-loaded pin, tooth, ball, or other element can be received, and the like. Still other manners of such releasable and adjustable connection along the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are possible and would be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Similarly, the plates <b>33</b> on either or both ends of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are preferably releasably and adjustably connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> as mentioned above. This feature permits a user to adjust the location of the plates <b>33</b> with respect to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in order to adjust for and accommodate variations in the vertical spacing (or height) between lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack in which the conversion rack of the present invention is installed. If a particular vertical distance (or height) is desired between such lateral stretchers <b>12</b>, adjustment of the plates <b>33</b> on the secondary vertical uprights <b>18</b> is an attractive and time-saving alternative to disconnecting, moving, and re-connecting the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> to different vertical positions in the warehouse-type rack. Preferably, the plates <b>33</b> at either or both ends of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are provided with slotted apertures <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), permitting a user to loosen threaded fasteners received therein, re-position the plates <b>33</b> to different vertical positions on the secondary uprights <b>18</b>, and tighten the threaded fasteners to secure the plates <b>33</b> in the different vertical positions.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, it should be noted that the manner in which the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in the illustrated preferred embodiment is only one example of a number of different connection types that can be employed in the present invention. The secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in other manners, such as by being integrally formed therewith or permanently connected thereto (e.g., by welding, brazing, riveting, and the like). In other embodiments, alternative releasable connections of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are possible. By way of example only, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can have ends that are shaped to be received within apertures <b>40</b>, sockets, or other receptacles in the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12B</figref> of the second preferred embodiment), can have threaded ends received within threaded apertures in the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, can be received within collars or between supports connected in any conventional manner to the top or sides of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, can be bolted, pinned, clamped, clipped, or secured with one or more conventional fasteners in any other manner to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The manner in which the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be adjustably positioned with respect to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> at least partially depends upon the type of connection employed between these elements. For example, in a releasable pinned or bolted connection (using aligned apertures in the plates <b>33</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as described above), multiple apertures along the lengths of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and/or the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are preferred as described above. However, where the ends of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are received within apertures <b>40</b> in the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, multiple apertures <b>40</b> running along the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are preferred. In still other embodiments employing other conventional fasteners such as clamps, some fasteners can be secured in an infinite or nearly-infinite range of positions on the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> or the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. All such manners of releasably and adjustably connecting the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are considered to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To increase the structural strength and stability of the conversion rack apparatus of the present invention and to provide more options for connecting merchandise display and storage elements within the conversion rack apparatus, optional support spacers <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) can be connected to and between adjacent secondary uprights <b>18</b>. The support spacers <b>22</b> can also provide additional support for bearing the load of panels or walls <b>24</b> of the conversion rack apparatus, merchandise display and storage elements connected to the panels or walls <b>24</b> or otherwise directly or indirectly connected to the support spacers <b>22</b>, and merchandise supported by such elements. The support spacers <b>22</b> can be substantially flat elements such as the preferred stabilizer bars <b>20</b>, tubular elements such as the preferred secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, elements having a channel or angle-shaped cross-section, or elements having any other hollow or solid cross-sectional shape desired. In addition, the support spacers <b>22</b> can be made of any resilient material such as those described above with reference to the elements of the warehouse-type rack.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The ends of the support spacers <b>22</b> are preferably connected to adjacent secondary uprights <b>18</b> by being received within apertures <b>42</b> in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Any aperture shape and cooperating support spacer end shape capable of retaining the ends of the support spacer <b>22</b> can be used. In some highly preferred embodiments such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the apertures <b>42</b> are keyhole shaped and receive turned flanged ends of the support spacers <b>22</b>. In other embodiments such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the apertures <b>42</b> in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> receive one or more pins or posts (headed or otherwise), fingers, or other protrusions extending from or integral with the ends of the support spacers <b>22</b>. In still other embodiments, the ends of the support spacers <b>22</b> are connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> using conventional fasteners, inter-engaging elements, or any of the connection methods described above with reference to the connections between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some preferred embodiments, the support spacers <b>22</b> are adjustably connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and so can be connected at different locations along the height of the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. By way of example only, the support spacers <b>22</b> can be connected to any of the apertures. <b>42</b> (at a number of different heights) on the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in the second preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In other embodiments, the connection location of the support spacers <b>22</b> on the secondary uprights <b>18</b> is adjustable in any of the manners described above with reference to the preferred connection adjustability of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, secondary uprights <b>18</b>, stabilizer bars <b>20</b> (if used), and support spacers <b>22</b> (if used) represent the framework of the conversion rack assembly upon which any number of different merchandise display and storage elements or fixtures can be mounted, preferably in a wide range of depths, heights, and lateral positions in a warehouse-type rack assembly. Although a wide variety of conventional merchandise display and storage elements and fixtures can be mounted on this framework (such as baskets, shelves, hangers, posts, panels, walls, etc.), only two will be described herein for purposes of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Panels or walls <b>24</b> can be connected to the conversion rack assembly by being connected to one or more support spacers <b>22</b>, by being connected to one or more secondary uprights <b>18</b>, and/or by being connected to one or more secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. An example of panels or walls being connected to support spacers <b>22</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the panel <b>24</b> is an expanded metal sheet having brackets <b>43</b> connected thereto in any conventional manner (e.g., by welding, threaded fasteners, wire, and the like). The brackets <b>43</b> preferably engage with the support spacers <b>22</b> to at least partially support the panel <b>24</b> upon the support spacers <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the panels <b>24</b> could be fastened directly to the support spacers <b>22</b>, such as by bolts passing through the panels <b>24</b> and into apertures in the support spacers <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the tops and/or bottoms of the panels <b>24</b> can be received within channels defined by the support spacers <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Still other manners of mounting panels or walls <b>24</b> within the conversion rack assembly are possible and would be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the panels or walls <b>24</b> can take any form desired, including without limitation solid or apertured plates, expanded metal, mesh, corrugated or shaped panels, peg-board, welded wire grid, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An example of panels or walls <b>24</b> being connected to secondary uprights <b>18</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, the panels or walls <b>24</b> are received within channels <b>44</b> connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. The channels <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>) can be defined by flanges of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> or can be connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in any of the manners described above with reference to the connection of the support spacers <b>22</b> to the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the channels <b>44</b> are connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> by headed posts on the channels <b>44</b> received within apertures <b>42</b> in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> (or vice versa). Alternatively, the panels or walls <b>24</b> can be provided with pins, posts, fingers, or other protrusions received within the secondary upright apertures <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>). In still other embodiments, the panels or walls <b>24</b> can be fastened to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in a manner similar to that described above with reference to the connections between the panels or walls <b>24</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another manner in which to secure panels or walls <b>24</b> within the rack assembly of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> provide another example of how a panel or wall <b>24</b> can be connected to secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In this embodiment, the panel or wall <b>24</b> is secured to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> using the same connection features or elements to which shelves and other merchandise display and storage elements are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>, a wire rack panel <b>24</b> is preferably received within a frame defined by vertical channels <b>44</b> and horizontal support spacers <b>22</b>. The vertical channels <b>44</b> and horizontal support spacers <b>22</b> can be connected in any conventional manner, and in the illustrated preferred embodiment are connected together by inserts <b>52</b> (described in greater detail below) extending from the support spacers <b>22</b> into the ends of the vertical channels <b>44</b>. Alternatively, the vertical channels <b>44</b> can be connected to the support spacers <b>22</b> by welds, brazing, other inter-engaging elements, bolts, screws, nails, pins, posts, clips, clamps, and other conventional fasteners, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The support spacers <b>22</b> and/or the vertical channels <b>44</b> are preferably secured to the secondary uprights in any of the manners just described for connecting the support spacers <b>22</b> to the vertical channels <b>44</b>. More preferably however, conventional fasteners such as bolts, screws, or pins are inserted through apertures in the support spacers <b>22</b> and/or the vertical channels <b>44</b> aligned with apertures in the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In some highly preferred embodiments, multiple apertures in the support spacers <b>22</b> and in the vertical channels <b>44</b> permit the panel or wall <b>24</b> to be secured in different locations on the secondary uprights <b>18</b> as desired. For example, the wall <b>24</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> is attached to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in an off-center position to demonstrate this mounting versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a wall or panel <b>24</b> can be mounted to any number of secondary uprights <b>18</b> in a number of different manners, only some of which employ channels <b>44</b>, laterally-extending support spacers <b>22</b>, and other frame-type elements. Any other manner of directly or indirectly connecting a wall or panel <b>24</b> to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can instead be employed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Because in some embodiments the secondary spacers <b>22</b> can be connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> at different heights and because the secondary uprights <b>18</b> permit connection of other elements thereto at different heights, the location of panels and other merchandise display and storage elements and fixtures can be further adjusted as desired by the user to provide a wide range of configurations to meet the needs or requirements of any number of retail environments.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another example of merchandising display and storage elements that can be used in conjunction with the present invention is shelving. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref> which show examples of shelves that can be connected to the conversion rack assembly of the present invention, shelving can be connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> or to panels or walls <b>24</b> which are connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the shelves <b>26</b> can have one or more teeth, fingers, or other protrusions which can mate with apertures <b>46</b> in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> or panels or walls <b>24</b>. Such shelving connections and alternatives thereto are well known to those skilled in the art and are not therefore described further herein. However, for purposes of adjustability, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or the panels or walls <b>24</b> preferably have multiple apertures along their lengths to enable a wide range of positions in which the shelves <b>26</b> can be connected as desired. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, it should be noted that some shelves <b>26</b> can be adapted to permit installation in particular locations in the warehouse-type rack, such as the bottom shelf illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref> adapted for installation in a limited number of secondary upright apertures <b>46</b> and not requiring support from the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack. In addition, the lateral adjustability of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> enables the use of any number of different lengths of shelves and fixtures, contributing to the versatility of the conversion rack assembly. Thus, shelving and other types of retail display and storage fixtures can be arranged vertically and laterally in just about any desired configuration to meet the needs of different retail and storage environments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Still other merchandising display and storage elements can be mounted in the conversion rack assembly of the present invention. Most preferably, these merchandise display and storage elements can be adjustably mounted as described above in a range of lateral, depth, and height positions in the warehouse-type rack, thereby providing existing warehouse-type racks with significantly increased flexibility and adaptability.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The various features and structures of the present invention as described above can be employed in any combination desired to result in rack assemblies having different degrees of simplicity, adjustability, and versatility. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> for example, the rack assembly employs many of the same components described above, including front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, secondary uprights <b>18</b>, and stabilizer bars <b>20</b>, but employs a different manner of connection between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. Specifically, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> have apertures <b>48</b> through which the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> extend in order to connect the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18C</figref>). Although this mating relationship can provide sufficient strength for the rack assembly, the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be further secured in this relationship in any conventional manner, such as by welds, brazing, adhesive or cohesive bonding material, by one or more screws, bolts, nails, rivets, clips, clamps, pins, and other conventional fasteners, by snap or interference fitting the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> within the secondary uprights <b>18</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other manners of interconnecting the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can be employed and fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can extend through apertures in the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be received within notches, recesses, or other apertures located in the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (and vice-versa) defining other types of inter-engagement between these elements. Depending at least partially upon the type of inter-engagement between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, these elements can be adjustable with respect to one another as desired. For example, the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref> can be slidable to different positions in the aperture(s) <b>48</b> of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to alter the depth of the rack assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With continued reference to the rack assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref>, the manner of connection between the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b> described above can be employed between any connected front-rear stretcher <b>16</b> and secondary upright <b>18</b>. By way of example only, and with reference to the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref>, both upper and lower front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are received through apertures <b>48</b> in the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, only some of the front-rear stretchers are connected in this manner. The other front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are connected to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> in any of the other manners described above with reference to the earlier embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be noted that the same secondary upright <b>18</b> can be connected to any number of front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. In a two-level rack assembly, each secondary upright <b>18</b> can be connected to a top front-rear stretcher <b>16</b>, a bottom front-rear stretcher <b>16</b>, and (more preferably) both top and bottom front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, a secondary upright can be connected to three or more front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, such as multiple front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> extending through apertures <b>48</b> at different vertical locations along the secondary upright <b>18</b>. This ability to connect any desired number of front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to the secondary uprights <b>18</b> significantly increases the modularity and versatility of the present invention. In these and other embodiments, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> need not terminate at the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to which they are connected. Instead, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can extend above and/or below such front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>, in some cases permitting attachment of further support spacers <b>22</b>, stabilizer bars <b>20</b>, panels or walls <b>24</b>, shelves <b>26</b>, other merchandise display and storage elements, and other structure and elements as desired. By way of example only, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref> extend vertically above the upper front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> for attachment of additional shelves <b>26</b> or other elements thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments of the present invention, each of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> extend between and are supported by lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of a warehouse-type rack. However, it should be noted that not all front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> need to have this relationship with the warehouse rack lateral stretchers <b>12</b>. In some cases, less than all of the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are supported by the warehouse rack lateral stretchers <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, the upper front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> are located above the upper lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse rack, and are sufficiently supported by the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to support a load placed upon the upper front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> without additional support. This type of relationship between front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and secondary uprights <b>18</b> enables an assembler to locate front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> (and therefore, shelves <b>26</b> and other components supported thereby) in different locations along the secondary uprights <b>18</b> independent of the location of the warehouse rack lateral stretchers <b>12</b>, thereby further increasing the versatility of the present invention. In this regard, multiple apertures <b>48</b> in the illustrated preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18C</figref> can be provided in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> for connection of secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> at two or more different heights in the warehouse rack. Similar versatility is available in embodiments where the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in any of the other manners described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In those embodiments of the present invention in which less than all of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are directly supported by lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse rack, the load carried by secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> not supported in this manner is preferably carried by one or more other secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> on the same secondary uprights <b>18</b>. For example, and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the upper secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are supported by the secondary uprights <b>18</b>, which are in turn supported by the lower secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> on the lower warehouse rack lateral stretchers <b>12</b>. Subject to the load-bearing capacity of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse rack, any number of secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can be supported in this manner as desired. Additionally, secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> that are not directly supported by warehouse rack lateral stretchers <b>12</b> can be supported from above and/or below by other front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> on the same secondary uprights <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Although a number of embodiments of the present invention employ secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> that extend between and rest upon lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of a warehouse-type rack as described above and illustrated in the figures, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can also or instead be directly supported by the uprights <b>10</b> and/or the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> of the warehouse-type rack. In this regard, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in some alternative embodiments can be connected to the uprights <b>10</b> and/or the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An example of such an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>. In this embodiment, the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are preferably connected directly to the uprights <b>10</b> of a warehouse-type rack. The front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are generally L-shaped as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, but can instead take any of the other shapes described above with reference to the other embodiments of the present invention. The front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are preferably connected at desired vertical positions on the uprights <b>10</b> by conventional fasteners passed through apertures in the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the uprights <b>10</b>. However, depending at least partially upon the type of uprights <b>10</b> employed, the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can be connected to the uprights <b>10</b> in any other manner, including the manners of connection described above with reference to the connection between the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b>. In some highly preferred embodiments, pins or headed posts on the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> are received within apertures in the uprights <b>10</b> of the warehouse-type rack (or vice versa). Preferably, the pins, headed posts, or other fasteners extend laterally into the apertures in the uprights <b>10</b> (or vice versa), although other manners of establishing such connections are possible, connections to the front or rear faces of the uprights <b>10</b>, the outside faces of the uprights <b>10</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some applications, significant advantages can be achieved by attaching secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> to the uprights <b>10</b> as described above. With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> for example, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can preferably be connected at different vertical locations along the uprights <b>10</b>. This enables a user to install the modular rack conversion assembly according to such embodiments at different vertical locations in a warehouse rack independently of the locations of the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse rack. In this regard, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> do not need to rest upon and be supported by the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse rack. Accordingly, such embodiments of the present invention can provide a significantly greater degree of flexibility with regard to the location of the present invention installed within a warehouse rack. In some embodiments, assemblies according to the present invention can be installed at a number of different heights within the warehouse rack, and can even be located one above another in the same section of a warehouse rack.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Another advantage provided by embodiments of the present invention such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> is the ability to adapt the assembly to accept connection of standardized rack components (e.g., shelves). By way of example only, in some applications such standardized rack components are dimensioned to be received within and between warehouse rack uprights spaced a standardized distance apart (which can be defined by the lengths of the lateral stretchers <b>12</b>). In order to connect such rack components to the assembly of the present invention, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be at least partially located between the planes defined by the inboard and outboard faces of the warehouse rack uprights <b>10</b>. In this manner, shelves and other rack components having standard sizes can still be readily connected to the assembly of the present invention without modification to the assembly, the components, or the warehouse rack. Although not required, the secondary spacers <b>22</b> in such embodiments can extend laterally beyond the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (particularly in cases where such secondary spacers <b>22</b> have standardized dimensions that are longer than the distance between the outer faces of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> provides an example of an alternative manner in which the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as described above. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>, a frame is defined by secondary uprights <b>18</b> and support spacers <b>22</b>. More specifically, the bottom and top of each secondary upright <b>18</b> is connected to a support spacer <b>22</b> extending between and connected to adjacent secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. The secondary uprights <b>18</b> are preferably connected to the support spacers <b>22</b> by receiving inserts <b>52</b> extending from the support spacers <b>22</b> into the ends of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). The inserts <b>52</b> are preferably flanged members secured to the support spacers <b>22</b> by being welds, brazing, adhesive or cohesive bonding material, and the like. In some embodiments, the inserts <b>52</b> can be connected to the support spacers <b>22</b> in any other manner (such as by conventional fasteners, snap-fitting, inter-engaging elements, and the like) and can even be integral with the support spacers. Alternatively, inserts <b>52</b> can be secured to or integral with the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and can extend into mating engagement with apertures in the support spacers <b>22</b>. For example, inserts <b>52</b> can extend from the secondary uprights <b>18</b> into the ends of the support spacers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Whether the inserts <b>52</b> (if employed) extend into the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or the support spacers <b>22</b>, the inserts <b>52</b> can snugly fit into their mating apertures for a secure connection between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b>. If desired, these elements can be further secured together by fasteners, welds, brazing, adhesive or cohesive bonding material, or in any other manner.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The rack assembly embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> employs inserts <b>52</b> to connect secondary uprights <b>18</b> to support spacers <b>22</b>. Although highly preferred, this manner of connection can be substituted for any of those described above with reference to the connection between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9C</figref>. An attractive feature provided by the type of connection illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is the ability to quickly and easily assemble the rack assembly and a frame for a panel or wall <b>24</b> defined at least in part by the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a panel or wall <b>24</b> can be connected within the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b> by being received within channels in the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or the support spacers <b>22</b>. Alternatively, a panel or wall <b>24</b> can be secured in the rack assembly in other manners, such as with conventional fasteners or in any other manner described herein. If desired, any number of intermediate secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be connected to the support spacers <b>18</b> in any of the manners described above with reference to the connection between these elements in other embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> for example, an intermediate secondary upright <b>18</b> is preferably attached to upper and lower support spacers <b>22</b> by inserts <b>52</b> as described above. Multiple panels or walls <b>24</b> can be secured in such a wall assembly in any of the manners also described above.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some preferred embodiments of the rack assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>, the positions of the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and support spacers <b>22</b> (if used) are adjustable. Specifically, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and support spacers <b>22</b> can be located at different positions along the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</figref>, flanges <b>52</b> of the support spacers <b>22</b> are provided with apertures <b>56</b> and can preferably be secured in different desired positions along the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. In this regard, the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> can be provided with apertures <b>54</b> along at least part of their length for connecting the support spacers <b>22</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b> to the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> at different locations along the front-rear stretchers. Preferably, this connection is performed by passing threaded fasteners such as bolts or screws through aligned apertures <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> in the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and the support spacers <b>22</b>. Alternatives to bolts or screws include without limitation pins, posts, rivets, and other conventional fasteners. Most preferably however, the fasteners are releasable in order to enable adjustment of the position of the support spacers <b>22</b> and the secondary uprights <b>18</b> upon the front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Apertured flanges on the support spacers <b>22</b> provide a convenient manner in which to connect (and more preferably, adjustably connect) the support spacers <b>22</b> to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. However, it will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that the support spacers <b>22</b> can be connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in a number of other manners. Also, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can instead be connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in alternative embodiments to the rack assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> (such as where inserts <b>52</b> on the ends of the secondary uprights extend laterally into the ends of the support spacers <b>22</b>, providing an arrangement of elements in which the secondary uprights <b>18</b> are better positioned to be directly connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>). In any case, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and/or the support spacers <b>22</b> can be connected to the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> in any manner described above with reference to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> are preferably connected to the uprights <b>10</b> of the warehouse-type rack assembly, and more preferably can be connected to the uprights <b>10</b> in different vertical positions along the uprights <b>10</b>. In alternative embodiments, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> are supported by (and in some cases can also be connected to) the lateral stretchers <b>12</b> of the warehouse-type rack assembly in any manner, including those described above with reference to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> are replaced by the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> of the warehouse-type rack. In such embodiments, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be connected to the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> (and more preferably, can be adjustably connected to the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b>) in any of the manners described above with reference to the connections between the secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As noted above, the secondary uprights <b>18</b> can be connected to the front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> of a warehouse-type rack rather than to secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. However, in some embodiments, one or more secondary uprights <b>18</b> are connected to front-rear stretcher(s) <b>14</b> of the warehouse-type rack while one or more other secondary uprights <b>18</b> are connected to secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b>. For example, the left upper and lower front-rear stretchers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> can be secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> as described above, while the right upper and lower front-rear stretchers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> can be front-rear stretchers <b>14</b> of the warehouse-type rack (and vice versa). Other stretcher combinations are possible and fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the illustrated preferred embodiments, an entire bay of a warehouse-type rack is shown &#x201c;converted&#x201d; by the conversion rack apparatus of the present invention. However, it should be noted that any part of the warehouse-type rack can be converted in this manner. For example, a user may desire to assemble a conversion rack according to the present invention only in half, a third, or a quarter of a full bay of a warehouse-type rack. By selecting the number and placement of the secondary front-rear stretchers <b>16</b> and secondary uprights <b>18</b> and the lengths of the stabilizer bars <b>20</b>, support spacers <b>22</b>, and panels or walls <b>24</b> (if used), any portion of a bay of a warehouse-type rack can be converted as described above. In addition to the advantages also described above, this provides the user with still more flexibility in the use of warehouse rack space.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As used in the appended claims, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; does not necessarily mean that one element is fastened, secured, or otherwise attached to another element.
